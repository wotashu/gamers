You hide behind stuff, do a little <a data-ref-id=\"3015-612\" href=\"/blind-fire/3015-612/\" slug=\"blind-fire\">blind-firing</a>, toss a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenade</a> or two, and shoot tons of enemy soldiers in their faces. The campaign gameplay is functional, if a bit clunky, and it has many of the features you'd expect a shooter of this type to have. It's a bit dull to play, with most of its differences coming as a result of enemies (and players) not taking too many hits to drop. But that's probably not why you should care about The Line. Because behind its generic look and feel is a storyline that puts you into some really interesting situations that put the simple act of trudging across the desert and gunning down anyone who gets in your way into a very different context than the average shooter. Add to that some interesting moral decisions and multiple endings and you've got... well, you've got a collection of really cool things that would be a lot easier to recommend if the game surrounding those things wasn't so drab.</p><p style=\"\">The setup is that you're a Delta Force operator named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13723\" href=\"/martin-walker/3005-13723/\" slug=\"martin-walker\">Walker</a>, and you, along with two squadmates, have been dropped into <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2704\" href=\"/dubai/3035-2704/\" slug=\"dubai\">Dubai</a>. Dubai has been cut off for six months due to extreme sandstorms, and a US battalion that went in to gather up and extract survivors has seemingly been swallowed up by the sand. When you head to find out what happened, you discover that a conflict between the seemingly rogue battalion and the locals has erupted. Has the 33rd battalion and its commander, John Konrad, gone crazy? Who's inciting the locals to rise up and fight? As your rescue mission quickly falls apart, you'll find the answers to these questions and others. What's more, those answers are actually quite interesting, making the back third of the game--which is where most of the moral choices and important reveals lie--a collection of fascinating sequences that make the game's displays of abject brutality more meaningful than in something like, say, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26633\" href=\"/homefront/3030-26633/\" slug=\"homefront\">Homefront</a>. The Line is more about showing you the horrible things that come about as a result of good-intentioned people going too far.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1334530-722375176.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1334530\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1334530-722375176.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1334530\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/1334530-722375176.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>You'll start the game as a three-man crew.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's a seemingly minor thing, but the way the game handles player and squad dialogue creates one of those headslapping moments where you wonder why it's taken so long for someone to do this. As the story escalates, your soldiers get more harried and haggard, leading to shifts in their dialogue. At the outset, they sound like soldiers, calling out targets, kills, and reloads like you'd expect from a modern military game. At a specific point in the game, they switch, getting angrier. The squadmates get shorter with each other, and the jokes cracked at beginning of the game are replaced with curse-filled tirades as they question each others' actions. Reloading dialogue gets rougher. It happens again even later in the game, and by that point things have turned so bad that Walker is just swearing at his gun every time he needs to reload it. It isn't perfect by any means--the dialogue repeats itself too frequently and you'll occasionally hear one line of \"professional soldier\" dialogue immediately followed by \"completely unraveled\" dialogue, but make a note. You'll probably see games employ this style of adaptive recurring dialogue in more games in the future.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame that these tactics didn't find their way into a better game. Spec Ops: The Line is a stock third-person shooter with its share of turret sequences and cover-vaulting mechanics. You can deliver orders to your two allies, but this consists of little more than being able to say \"shoot that guy first.\" There's no cooperative play in there, though that probably benefits the campaign a bit by letting it remove your squad to increase tension in a couple of spots. It's also not very long, though a few spots could have used an additional checkpoint or two, as it's easy to get careless during some of the longer battles and die, forcing you to replay a bit more than you'd like.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">There's also a competitive multiplayer mode, complete with all of the loadout options and perks you'd expect. It gets a little shifty by offering slight differences between the two factions and each class offers different bonuses to nearby teammates, but beyond that it's the same sort of treadmill you've gotten on a million times before. Again, this is a case where that treadmill would be a lot more palatable if the action was more satisfying. Despite colorful names like \"Chaos\" and \"Mutiny,\" most of the multiplayer modes are pretty standard. The first on-screen bullet points for those two modes are just \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-451\" href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" slug=\"deathmatch\">Deathmatch</a>\" and \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">Team Deathmatch</a>,\" which makes you wonder why they bothered to name them something different in the first place. In addition to those combat modes, there are also a few objective-based types, but the action feels really off compared to other games of this type. It feels like the players skitter around a little too much, even when the network connections appear to be good. The other twist Spec Ops puts on things is that levels are occasionally hit with a sandstorm, taking out your radar and making visibility poor for a little bit. It doesn't really add much to the experience.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2066095-screenshot_00067.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2066095\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2066095-screenshot_00067.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2066095\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2066095-screenshot_00067.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2066095-screenshot_00067.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are plenty of indoor areas to explore along with the sandstorm-filled exteriors.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">On top of all that, the multiplayer looks pretty terrible. The textures and objects in the maps look old, like they were originally designed for a different console and hastily pumped up to something more closely resembling today's standards. The multiplayer also shows off some of the worst Unreal Engine texture pop-in I've seen in a long, long time. The single-player looks a bit better than that and offers a bit of variety that actually manages to deliver a few well-put-together areas but the whole game is rife with jumpy animation and overall, Dubai never really feels like a place. It feels like a strung-together patch of levels of varying quality.</p><p style=\"\">The story in Spec Ops: The Line isn't amazing, but the way that it's told really stands out and, in many ways, saves the entire project from being a complete waste of time. But that doesn't make it easy to recommend. It delivers some interesting ideas that approach the messed-up things that often happen in war-based video games in ways that actually make sense. It gives proper weight to the potential horrors of conflict instead of just throwing them in your face for mere shock value. If that interests you, The Line is worth seeing.</p>", "deck": "Spec Ops: The Line is a mostly standard shooter with its share of rough edges, but it handles the subject matter of armed conflict in some extremely interesting ways.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-504/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29445/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/spec-ops-the-line/3030-29445/", "id": 29445, "name": "Spec Ops: The Line"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-06-29 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-98634/", "id": 98634, "name": "Spec Ops: The Line"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/spelunky-review/1900-505/", "description": "<p style=\"\">There are a lot of descriptors I could toss at <a href=\"/spelunky/3030-24999/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24999\">Spelunky</a>. Any number of terms could aptly describe the experience of playing this delightfully nasty platformer from developers <a href=\"/derek-yu/3040-90931/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90931\">Derek Yu</a> and Andy Hull, but the one that I think best sums it up is \"meticulous.\" Spelunky is a game that, on the surface, looks like a minor trifle. It's a short little 2D platformer with a plucky hero, a small variety of gadgets and attacks, and only a handful of levels that are, of course, ridiculously challenging. But within minutes of digging into Spelunky's gameplay, you'll realize there's far more at work here than meets the eye. Yu and Hull have packed Spelunky with so much weird hidden content that no two play experiences are ever quite alike. It's frankly insane just how deep Spelunky's rabbit hole goes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67447/1296188-spelunky_xbla_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296188\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67447/1296188-spelunky_xbla_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296188\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67447/1296188-spelunky_xbla_02.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Spelunky doesn't hate you. It just has no patience for careless players.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Or I guess I should say \"mine shaft,\" since Spelunky begins with one of several cartoon adventurers plunging into the depths of a treasure-ridden cave. This cave is filled with nasty spiders, snakes, bats, and even the occasional shotgun-toting shopkeeper. It's also rife with sweet, delicious loot, damsels in distress, and valuable idols that may prove a tad risky to acquire.</p><p style=\"\">Did I say a tad risky? I meant overwhelmingly deadly. Spelunky is a game about constant death. It borrows from the roguelike genre in that death is permanent. Once you die, you go all the way back to the beginning, with none of your money, weapons, or items in tow. That's the flip side to Spelunky's length, which some have quoted as being as short as 10 minutes, if you've mastered the nuances of the games' randomized level designs. Oh, did I mention every level is dynamically generated? Because it is.</p><p style=\"\">Because of this, every single play-through of Spelunky feels like a new challenge. Every time you die, you get the sense that you've learned something about the game. This is not a game that deals in cheap, unreasonable death. If you die, it's probably because you weren't looking carefully enough at the path ahead, or simply mistimed an attack or jump. While the levels are procedurally generated, the core concepts of what you have to do to survive remain constant. They're just shuffled up and dealt out randomly each go-around.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The mine is just the first of multiple different worlds in Spelunky, and each world comes with its own set of enemies and unique challenges. Good luck getting to those worlds, however, as you'll be lucky to ever see them all. I died roughly 67 times before I ever reached the vine-covered confines of the jungle world... and then I died within six seconds of getting there. I've been back twice since, and died only slightly further in each time.</p><p style=\"\">Spelunky is an abject <i>fucker</i> of a game. It's a crass thing to say, but considering the number of expletives I shouted at my TV while playing it, I think it's warranted. There are times when this game's difficulty borders on straight-up abusive.</p><p style=\"\">Yet it never quite crosses that line, thanks to the randomized levels, as well as the absurd breadth of things to discover peppered throughout the game. It's hard to explain just how out-there Spelunky gets with this stuff, but to quickly illustrate, I'm still finding new weapons, gadgets, and strange hidden levels over a hundred plays in. You always have your trusty whip, and you'll start the game with a limited number of ropes (for climbing to high ledges) and bombs (for busting up the environment), but there's also a parachute to help you avoid dying from high falls, or a web shooting gun useful for slowing down enemies. If you linger in a level too long without doing anything, a mischievous ghost shows up out of nowhere to mess with you. And I still don't know how I randomly ended up in the game's graveyard level, or why I haven't seen it since the one time I ended up there.</p><p style=\"\">Those are just a few examples. As I said, I'm still discovering stuff as I continue to play. And continue to play I do, despite the game's apparent disdain for me, the player. In truth, I've no one to blame but myself for my failures in Spelunky. Sure, sometimes the game generates a level with outright heinous enemy placements, but there's always a way around the worst obstacles--albeit sometimes an impossible-seeming one. Yu and Hull have crafted a game with such specific, completely inviolable rules that you can't call the game cheap in any way. Well, maybe that one time where I literally died two seconds after beginning the first level, but that was an aberration. In every other case, I knew why I died, and it was because I failed to follow the rules carefully enough. This is as mechanically sound a platformer as there's ever been.</p><p style=\"\">Which isn't to say it's a perfect game. As a single-player experience, it's top flight, but the multiplayer drags. Multiplayer is solely local, and comes in co-op and deathmatch forms. Playing the game cooperatively is hectic in a way that is not conducive to making a great deal of progress, unless you're playing with experts, and the deathmatch is just bizarre. While there's a nice variety of maps, the gameplay is just too frantic to ever cohere into a playable experience. I've talked to some who quite enjoyed the unyielding chaos of the deathmatch mode, but I couldn't find much to like about it.</p><p style=\"\">But that doesn't matter, because all I'm doing is playing the single-player mode, which is a wholly addicting experience all on its own. All I want to do is go back and keep trying for better scores and greater progress. In this regard, Spelunky is less a game than an obsession. If it does get its hooks in you, it will get those hooks deep, sending you into a downward spiral of torrential swearing and tear-choked misery the likes of which you may never completely recover from. And I mean that as a compliment.</p>", "deck": "The Xbox Live Arcade update of Spelunky is as madly brilliant as it is maddeningly pitiless.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-505/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24999/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/spelunky/3030-24999/", "id": 24999, "name": "Spelunky"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-07-03 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-128068/", "id": 128068, "name": "Spelunky"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/theatrhythm-final-fantasy-review/1900-506/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1844034-2132455703_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1844034\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1844034-2132455703_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1844034\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57793/1844034-2132455703_full.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Not nearly as weird as it looks.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The music of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-194\" href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" slug=\"final-fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a> is so integral to the series' enduring popularity it's a wonder Square Enix hasn't made a game focused purely <i>on</i> that music until now. Enter <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35842\" href=\"/theatrhythm-final-fantasy/3030-35842/\" slug=\"theatrhythm-final-fantasy\">Theatrhythm Final Fantasy</a>, a rhythm action game that runs the risk of being almost as absurd as its nonsense title. I was all ready to chuckle at this game when it crossed my desk and then move on with my life, but it turns out that tapping your stylus along to the dramatic Final Fantasy themes of yore is actually a ton of fun, and the game wraps enough unlockable content and RPG-style character progression around the core rhythm mechanic that it actually starts to feel like a decent value even at full price.</p><p style=\"\">Theatrhythm is a fine rhythm game in the mold of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11982\" href=\"/elite-beat-agents/3030-11982/\" slug=\"elite-beat-agents\">Elite Beat Agents</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7708\" href=\"/gitaroo-man/3030-7708/\" slug=\"gitaroo-man\">Gitaroo Man</a>, so if you're the sort of person who gobbles up every game of that type regardless of how you feel about the music, feel free to jump on in. But the people who should really be looking at this game are the ones who revere the grand scores that anchored Square's epics from the NES right on up to the modern era. For me, the Final Fantasy series marked one of the first times I realized music in a video game was actually capable of stirring the soul, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6336\" href=\"/final-fantasy-vi/3030-6336/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-vi\">VI</a> in particular inspired me to go out and spend a bunch of money on an actual soundtrack CD. That puts me smack dab in this game's crosshairs, and it does a good enough job of tweaking my nostalgic feelings for this material that I don't even care how blatantly I'm being pandered to.</p><p style=\"\">When you first fire up the game, it feels a little light on content, since you've only got access to a small selection of songs from each of the first 13 core games in the franchise. For each game, there's one \"field\" music (typically the overworld theme), one battle track (a mishmash of regular and boss themes, depending on the game), and one \"event\" piece that corresponds to a particular dramatic moment from the game's story, say, the famous opera scene from VI. Each of these song types comes with a unique type of gameplay, so you're doing a little of everything with each game, and they're always bookended by the opening and ending themes of the game in question, which let you tap out the rhythm to earn a little extra rhythmia (the game's unlock currency). Still, it takes less than 10 minutes to play through any one of the games in the series mode, and they're all extremely easy at first, so it's hard to ignore the feeling that there's just not much in here, especially for a full-priced 3DS game. Luckily, the more of Theatrhythm you play, the more it seems like there <i>is</i> to play.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2256048-c5b92aa9d5b4f13f34205b6f17b1498d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2256048\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2256048-c5b92aa9d5b4f13f34205b6f17b1498d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2256048\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/2256048-c5b92aa9d5b4f13f34205b6f17b1498d.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Leveling your party turns out to be pretty addicting.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game strengthens its case almost immediately since you get to build a party of four characters drawn from all the leads of each of the 13 games as soon as you boot it up. I went with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-949\" href=\"/cecil-harvey/3005-949/\" slug=\"cecil-harvey\">Cecil</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-515\" href=\"/terra-branford/3005-515/\" slug=\"terra-branford\">Terra</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-783\" href=\"/squall-leonhart/3005-783/\" slug=\"squall-leonhart\">Squall</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-773\" href=\"/lightning/3005-773/\" slug=\"lightning\">Lightning</a>, partly for nostalgia and partly because each character has significantly different stats and abilities that come into play depending on what sort of song you're playing and how well you do. You've got hit points and magic just like a regular RPG, and some abilities will heal you when your party becomes weak or unleash a certain type of elemental magic based on how many of a certain type of note you've hit. There are even single-use items you can equip that cause specific effects to trigger. Leveling up your party to unlock better and more unique abilities becomes sort of addicting in its own right, especially since the later difficulties can get overwhelmingly hard. I really grew to like the idea that leveling up my party and intelligently equipping them could help me scrape by during encounters that I had no chance of beating otherwise. You know, sort of like in the old Final Fantasy games this thing is based on. It's also worth mentioning that part of the game's charm lies in the cutesy art style all of these widely varying characters have been mashed into, and they tend to spit out some lovable nonsense dialogue in between songs. The game has a droll sense of humor in general that makes it more likable.</p><p style=\"\">Theatrhythm doesn't really get engrossing until you open up the challenge mode, where you can play those higher difficulties, and especially when you get access to the chaos shrine and start unlocking dark notes. That's right, <i>dark notes</i>. These are mystery combinations of one field and one battle music, so you don't know what songs you're going to play until you tackle that particular note. The upside of this is, the dark notes contain a bunch of new songs you won't see at all in the main story mode. The downside is, they're super tough, but they'll level your characters pretty quickly and will almost always drop you another dark note as a reward. I was mostly excited to get into the chaos shrine for some new music, but the dark notes, like everything else you do, will generate rhythmia, and the more of that you rack up, the closer you get to adding some more unique songs to your challenge mode lineup, or even unlocking some other fan-favorite characters like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-511\" href=\"/sephiroth/3005-511/\" slug=\"sephiroth\">Sephiroth</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-829\" href=\"/yuna/3005-829/\" slug=\"yuna\">Yuna</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1550\" href=\"/vivi-orunitia/3005-1550/\" slug=\"vivi-orunitia\">Vivi</a>.

It could've been easy to get upset about the selection of songs included with the base game, but aside from the conspicuous omission of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\" href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-iv\">Final Fantasy IV</a>'s final boss music, I'm generally pretty happy with what's already in here, which the game claims already amounts to \"over 70\" songs. It's not like there isn't already a long precedent for rhythm games selling piecemeal downloadable songs anyway, and at a dollar a song, the prices aren't completely insane. It's ridiculous, however, that the barebones in-game store doesn't offer some kind of preview of the available songs. You probably won't have much trouble finding samples of those songs by name on the Internet, but you should have that option at the point of sale, full stop. Otherwise, it's nice to have the option to pick and choose a few extra songs if you want to supplement what's already in the game.</p><p style=\"\">It probably says a lot that Theatrhythm so ably overcomes the absurdity of its premise and actually ends up deserving a place in the collection of rhythm-gaming Final Fantasy fans (either current or former). Given Square Enix's recent track record, it's easy to see this game showing up on iOS devices in the not-distant future, but if you're looking for an endearingly entertaining rhythm package to occupy your 3DS right now, Theatrhythm fits the bill.</p>", "deck": "Tapping your way through the memorable Final Fantasy themes of the past two decades is more fun than you'd think.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-506/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35842/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/theatrhythm-final-fantasy/3030-35842/", "id": 35842, "name": "Theatrhythm Final Fantasy"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-07-05 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115960/", "id": 115960, "name": "Theatrhythm Final Fantasy"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review/1900-507/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229152-007664.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229152\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56170212765957\" data-width=\"940\" style=\"width: 940px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229152-007664.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229152\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2229152-007664.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Being a vampire lord is all about abusing your physics powers.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3010-786\" href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" slug=\"bethesda-softworks\">Bethesda</a> struck a certain tone with the numerous piecemeal add-ons to its recent <a data-ref-id=\"3025-183\" href=\"/fallout/3025-183/\" slug=\"fallout\">Fallout</a> games. Those bite-size wasteland episodes created relatively short, focused storylines that took place in discrete new environments and often compartmentalized the best facets of the core game, like exploration and player choice, that made it special to begin with. In stark contrast, Dawnguard, the first downloadable add-on for <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33394\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394/\" slug=\"the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim\">Skyrim</a>, is more substantive and satisfying in structure and feel than any of the Fallout content. Where those add-ons were generally confined to a single new area with little or no connection to the game's original space, Dawnguard instead exists all over, inside, and around the land of Skyrim, not just adding a lengthy and well made central quest line but also sprinkling little morsels of major and minor new content into many a nook and cranny as well.</p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3015-117\" href=\"/vampire/3015-117/\" slug=\"vampire\">Vampires</a> rule the central conflict of Dawnguard, as an ancient sect of especially powerful bloodsuckers has recently come back to prominence in the north of Skyrim and begun plotting to blot out the sun for all eternity. (<a data-ref-id=\"3035-92\" href=\"/tamriel/3035-92/\" slug=\"tamriel\">Tamriel</a>'s vampires never have too much trouble with sunlight to begin with, but don't let that detract from the ominous threat of a neverending night.) Just a few minutes after loading a save with Dawnguard installed, you'll be approached by a courier or attacked by a roving pack of vampires, either of which informs you that the Dawnguard, the legendary league of vampire-hunters, has been reformed to fight the menace. You'll immediately head to the group's base to join up with them, and then set out to investigate the vampire lords causing all this trouble.</p><p style=\"\">Dawnguard really caught my attention early on by giving me the chance to turn my back on the Dawnguard in the course of that first mission and join up with the vampires instead. While your choice of faction affects which set of quests you'll do early in the add-on's storyline, the majority of Dawnguard's plot and locations are pretty much the same either way. But who you side up with certainly affects the tone of your interactions with all the new characters, and there's a whole mess of unique side quests that go along with each faction. It's a nice, dynamic way to give you some control over the way things play out in your story, especially since it gives you a chance to take actions that sensibly correspond to the sort of good or evil character you've already played for dozens of hours in Skyrim.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229156-007667.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229156\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56170212765957\" data-width=\"940\" style=\"width: 940px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229156-007667.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229156\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2229156-007667.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Serana's got some good old family strife to deal with. Too bad her family's all vampires.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The add-on also does a great job of conforming to the state of your particular game world. I noticed several instances of characters unique to this DLC referencing what I'd done in Skyrim's main storyline, and commenting on the nature of the civil war as I'd left it in my playthrough. Some existing locations are also altered to go along with the vampires' activities. You need to be level 10 before you'll start seeing the ambient events that invite you to start the DLC content, but you'd want to be at least that high just to have developed some powers and skills to use in the new quests anyway. On the whole, Dawnguard feels well integrated with all the existing content in Skyrim, in such a way that you rarely see the seams between the two releases.</p><p style=\"\">Whichever faction you choose, you'll get the chance to become a vampire lord, a new kind of super vampire that morphs you into a third-person wrecking machine similar to the existing werewolf form. The vampire lord is good for some laughs, since it has several physics-based powers that let you sling enemies around like ragdolls, and it also comes with some extremely useful powers like a teleport and enhanced night vision. But moving around in an oversized third-person creature form hasn't gotten anymore elegant than it was before--there are plenty of interior areas you can't even fit through as a vampire lord--and it takes a long time to morph into and out of, so I ended up not using the full creature form very much. (Luckily some of the ancillary powers like the night vision work in your regular form.) There's an entire perk tree devoted to expanding your vampiric powers (and another one for werewolves, if you happen to still be one of those), so if you do go in for the creature action, there's a good deal of customization to tailor your hijinks with. And it's a simple affair to cure your vampirism later if you want to try it out and then go back.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The Dawnguard quest line is anchored by the add-on's new follower Serana, a good-natured vampire daughter who struck me as one of the more fleshed-out and sympathetic characters in the whole of Skyrim. Maybe it's natural that you'd feel more attached to a character who you spend a good 10 hours with, but Serana's embroiled in some good old-fashioned family drama and delivers enough well-acted voiceover that you end up feeling pretty bad about what she's going through. (It's worth noting that you're required to keep Serana as a follower for most of the storyline, in case you just hate using followers for some reason.) The Dawnguard quest line takes you to some pretty cool new areas, including a plane of Oblivion, a decrepit old castle with some nifty environmental puzzles, and a vast frozen valley forgotten by time. I found the quest in that valley to be sort of poorly laid out, which makes it drag on longer than it should, but otherwise the quests move briskly, and the whole thing culminates in a dramatic and explosive confrontation that's flashier than most of the stuff you saw in Skyrim itself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229159-007669.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229159\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56170212765957\" data-width=\"940\" style=\"width: 940px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229159-007669.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229159\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2229159-007669.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2229159-007669.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fancy a trip to Oblivion?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One of the best things about the Dawnguard package to me is that it makes a bunch of big and little additions to the game even after you've dealt with the vampires. You'll come out of the main quest line with a couple of crazy items, like a bow you can shoot straight into the sun to rain hellfire down on enemies, and there's a good number of other unique items that you can uncover through side quests. (A headpiece that lets you have two standing stone effects at once, anyone?) There's at least one lengthy side quest in a unique dungeon and with an associated achievement and reward items that I'm aware of, as well as new types of armor, a new tier of \"legendary\" ambient dragon to fight, and some new spells and shouts to learn. Heck, I ended up with the ability to summon a spectral steed out of thin air, which is pretty great since I found managing live horses to be cumbersome in the original game. Again, this stuff is spread around the world in a way that keeps this add-on from feeling too self-contained.</p><p style=\"\">Dawnguard offers far more than a self-contained episode in the Fallout vein--which it should, at double the price--but it falls just short of the scope of a traditional, pre-Internet boxed expansion pack. Still, it's a fine way to expand the already immense content offering of Skyrim, especially if you're still actively traipsing around those snowy hills in search of more adventure. If Bethesda can figure out a way to combine this style of across-the-board enhancement with a more substantial new landmass in the next inevitable Skyrim add-on, it'll really have created something special. This is already a good start.</p>", "deck": "Skyrim's first DLC offers a broad array of quality new content that smoothly integrates into the game without feeling forced.", "dlc_name": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dawnguard", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-507/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33394/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394/", "id": 33394, "name": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-07-10 12:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-hd-review/1900-508/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227472-007345.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227472\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227472-007345.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227472\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227472-007345.jpg\"></a><figcaption>School II has you wallriding bells and dodging a runaway golf cart.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The rise and fall of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3025-10\" href=\"/tony-hawk/3025-10/\" slug=\"tony-hawk\">Tony Hawk</a> franchise was a spectacular and thrilling thing to watch over the series' decade-plus reign as the <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=23/\">skateboarding</a> game of record.

It controls the way you want it to. And the levels feel just like they did back in the late 1990s. But the subset of selected levels includes a few stinkers and its new modes and options don't land cleanly. It's different enough to void some of its nostalgic draw, but similar enough to remind you that parts of those early Tony Hawk games might not hold up so well over a decade later.</p><p style=\"\">At the outset, you're given access to the first of seven levels and the extra modes are locked up. For the most part, this is Pro Skater the way Pro Skater always was--there are goals to complete and you embark on as many two-minute runs as you need to complete them all. Completing goals opens up additional levels and gives you cash that you can use to enhance your skater with new tricks and upgraded stats. You'll also unlock additional single-player modes, like Big Head Elimination, where your skater's head blows up like a balloon and you must continually land longer and longer strings of tricks to keep your head from popping.</p><p style=\"\">Those trick strings adhere to the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-990\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/3030-990/\" slug=\"tony-hawks-pro-skater-2\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</a> level of combo theory, meaning that you can use manuals (skateboard wheelies) to connect your ground tricks together, but the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5688\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/3030-5688/\" slug=\"tony-hawks-pro-skater-3\">Tony Hawk 3</a> revert doesn't continue combos. This prevents players from just turning every two-minute run into one long, incredible combo as easily as it got to be in the later Tony Hawk games. But you kind of can't unring the bell on an innovation as earth-shattering (well, earth-shattering for what it did to Tony Hawk games, anyway) as the revert, and I found myself disappointed by the scaled-down combo system.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227473-007346.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227473\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227473-007346.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227473\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227473-007346.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Grinding over the Hangar pipe.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The level design is accurate to what appeared in the original games, though there are a few new goals in some spots and billboards and other textures have been updated. You won't find boxes for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1442\" href=\"/neversoft-entertainment/3010-1442/\" slug=\"neversoft-entertainment\">Neversoft</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89593\" href=\"/bruce-willis/3040-89593/\" slug=\"bruce-willis\">Bruce Willis</a>-themed dual-joystick shooter, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6823\" href=\"/apocalypse/3030-6823/\" slug=\"apocalypse\">Apocalypse</a>, in the mall level, for example. That means that the good levels, like the Warehouse and School II, are still good. And the lame levels, like Downhill Jam and the Mall, are still pretty lame. There's more good than bad on the level select list, but it's pretty easy to come up with a handful of missing levels from the first two games that belong in this collection.</p><p style=\"\">The online leaderboards help focus your trick sessions into competitions with your friends, and once you've completed all the goals in a level, subsequent runs instead show the next-highest score on the leaderboard for you to challenge. It also has online play for up to four players in standard Trick Attack and Graffiti modes. You can also free skate online or start up a Big Head Elimination game over Xbox Live, but really... Trick Attack and Graffiti are probably the modes you're looking for. The performance online seems OK, though other skaters occasionally warp around a little bit. I also had a few games fail to connect, but with a little persistence it isn't too hard to get a game going.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Visually, the game has nicer-looking skaters and textures, but it's a bit strange to see higher-resolution assets draped over level layouts that were originally made for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" slug=\"playstation\">PlayStation</a>. Also, the game's made with the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-86\" href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" slug=\"unreal-engine-3\">Unreal Engine</a>, so expect to see that telltale texture fade-in whenever you first load into a level. After that initial load, however, everything looks fine, if a little empty. The soundtrack is a mix of new-to-Tony-Hawk music and a few tracks that appeared in the original games. So no \"Police Truck,\" but you get \"Superman\" and that Anthrax/Public Enemy team-up. Much like the list of levels, the soundtrack feels awfully short, and after hearing the same batch of songs repeat for the third time, I finally just turned it down. Along with a mix of new and old music, there's also a mix of new and old skaters, including <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6031\" href=\"/eric-koston/3005-6031/\" slug=\"eric-koston\">Eric Koston</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6035\" href=\"/rodney-mullen/3005-6035/\" slug=\"rodney-mullen\">Rodney Mullen</a>, your Xbox 360 avatar, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-23681\" href=\"/riley-hawk/3005-23681/\" slug=\"riley-hawk\">Riley Hawk</a>, and more.</p><p style=\"\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is a terrific idea that just doesn't pan out as well as it feels like it should. All the little tweaks and decisions, from level list to the soundtrack to the decisions about which moves to include or exclude eventually start to weigh on the overall experience in a meaningful way. It turns something that should have been a joyous update and revival of a tarnished franchise into something that simply misses the mark.

That is to say, when you jump while standing still, you give a little vertical hop, and jumping to the side produces a leap with a fixed distance. You also do a lot of grabbing onto ledges and hoisting yourself up. It's that kind of game, and it's a good one...up to a point.</p><p style=\"\">Perhaps as ultimate tribute to its predecessors, Deadlight is itself set in the '80s, though you'd hardly know that based on the action that takes place over the course of the storyline. The only hints at the game's period setting come in the pages of your character's journal, which briefly reference <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3051\" href=\"/chernobyl-nuclear-power-plant/3035-3051/\" slug=\"chernobyl-nuclear-power-plant\">Chernobyl</a> and nuclear war, and in a couple of peripheral touches like a cassette-tape loading animation and some knockoff <a href=\"http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Tiger/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tiger LCD</a> handheld-game collectibles you can find. Otherwise, this is standard zombie-survival stuff, as you pick your way through the ruins of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-517\" href=\"/seattle/3035-517/\" slug=\"seattle\">Seattle</a>, avoiding the ubiquitous undead and brushing up against the crazed remnants of humanity and the fortresses they've built for themselves. The storytelling is weighed down by hammy voiceover and a lack of focus, and reaches for dramatic ambitions that lie far beyond its grasp, culminating in one of the more flabbergasting conclusions I've seen in quite some time.</p><p style=\"\">Then again, the storyline could be complete garbage in this sort of game as long as the action is on point, and you'd still end up with a satisfying piece of entertainment. The first of Deadlight's three acts indeed offers exactly what you'd want from a game like this, requiring you to meticulously leap and climb your way through ruined urban environments to get from place to place. The game smoothly introduces new mechanics--a running leap and roll, a fire axe, a pistol and shotgun--and starts to integrate them into the increasingly intricate level designs, forcing you to use your full repertoire to navigate each obstacle. The game also admirably teaches you to avoid combat when you're facing too many zombies. Ammo is pretty scarce, and even with the axe at your disposal, taking on more than three or four zombies at once can quickly end with you being overrun, so you need to know when to just get the hell out of there instead. It's to the game's credit that a lot of the individual scenarios do let you choose flight over fight, especially since you can yell out to the zombies to get their attention and lure them one way before you deftly maneuver around them and continue on.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/2278813-dl_005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2278813\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/2278813-dl_005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2278813\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12565/2278813-dl_005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's often better to avoid fighting and get the hell out of there.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once that extended tutorial period was over and I had all the game's abilities at my disposal, I was really getting into Deadlight's groove and felt excited about digging into more elaborate trials later on. But the game takes a hard left turn after that first act, interspersing your journey with a number of hectic, demanding action scenes that feel completely at odds with the methodical nature of the gameplay and the protracted, unresponsive way your character's animations play out. Picking your way through a series of rickety platforms and ladders is fine when you can do it at your own pace; when the game forces you to run through that same sort of area at breakneck speed, while you're being chased by a machine-gunning helicopter and with absolutely no margin for error, you're likely to simply have to die a few times to learn the exact layout so you can run it again perfectly. Other areas of the game hit you with things like a collapsing building that doesn't make it clear it's going to collapse until it's too late for you to reverse course and get out of the way, or a series of booby traps that likewise will kill you before you can avoid them if you don't already know they're there. Fast-paced action is not what this sort of game excels at, so it's baffling that the designers wanted to force you through such sequences so frequently.</p><p style=\"\">Outside of these isolated scenarios, the limitations of Deadlight's core gameplay also become apparent toward the end of the game in a number of minor ways that can add up to a major annoyance. Zombies have a habit of shambling slowly out of the background before snapping onto the game's active 2D plane, which looks really cool but makes it tough to gauge when you're actually able to hit them. Given how slow you are to move into and out of the attack animation, if you swing too early you can find yourself whiffing through thin air and then getting grabbed before you can get out of the way. One area in particular toward the end of the game wanted me to vault over a windowsill into a tiny space, pick up some ammo, reload my gun, shoot out a small target overhead, then vault back through the window--all while spawning infinite zombies into that tiny space. It's not that every minute of Deadlight's latter two-thirds is full of this kind of clumsy gameplay, but enough of it is--and enough of the quieter moments come with their own set of frustrations--to really detract from the overall quality of the gameplay, which otherwise feels pretty high. After such a strong start, it's disappointing the game doesn't fulfill more of its potential, and instead actively works against doing so in a lot of cases.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5294/2216834-deadlight_cut1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216834\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5294/2216834-deadlight_cut1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2216834\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5294/2216834-deadlight_cut1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5294/2216834-deadlight_cut1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game's attempts at storytelling mostly fall flat.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If there's one thing Deadlight nails with complete accuracy, it's presentation. The game establishes a credibly grim mood and visual tone from the very first scene, and--aside from the out-of-place voice acting--sticks with it through to the last shot. There's a fantastic amount of detail and tasteful distribution of light and shadow in each area, and the game uses to great effect the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26706\" href=\"/shadow-complex/3030-26706/\" slug=\"shadow-complex\">Shadow Complex</a> trick of showing you a wide angle while you're outdoors and then zooming in close for interior scenes. Given how small everything often is--the characters often appear as faraway figurines, the camera is so pulled out--it's an impressive feat how cohesive the visual design remains throughout the entire game.</p><p style=\"\">There aren't many action games in this particular mold to begin with these days, so those with fond memories of Deadlight's spiritual predecessors will likely have a reasonably fulfilling few hours here. Without an existing sense of nostalgia for the source material, though, you may find Deadlight's minor flaws collectively outweigh all the things it does right. It's one of those cases where Xbox Live Arcade's requirement to offer a free demo with every game is especially valuable.</p>", "deck": "The zombie-survival setting fits nicely with its deliberate style of 2D action, but Deadlight sometimes plays too fast and loose for its own good.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-509/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-37262/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/deadlight/3030-37262/", "id": 37262, "name": "Deadlight"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-07-31 08:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117912/", "id": 117912, "name": "Deadlight"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-expendables-2-review/1900-510/", "description": "<p style=\"\">A video game based on a movie license is not very good, and no one is surprised. It's the expected result nowadays when we hear that a publisher is working on some game based on a major motion picture.

Much as <i>The Expendables</i> film franchise is all about cobbling together aging action stars for a bit of nostalgic exploding of things, The Expendables 2 hearkens back to a bygone era of action gaming, when games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-605\" href=\"/contra/3025-605/\" slug=\"contra\">Contra</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-342\" href=\"/ikari-warriors/3025-342/\" slug=\"ikari-warriors\">Ikari Warriors</a> let players blast through absurd waves of pixelated bad guys, and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-60843\" href=\"/sylvester-stallone/3040-60843/\" slug=\"sylvester-stallone\">Sylvester Stallone</a> still had his original face.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, a good idea is all The Expendables 2 has going for it. And that idea isn't worth much when it's executed so miserably.</p><p style=\"\">This is a four-player co-op shooter featuring four of the film series' muscle-bound protagonists. You can play as Stallone's pistol-toting Barney Ross, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-97435\" href=\"/jet-li/3040-97435/\" slug=\"jet-li\">Jet Li's</a> knife-throwing Yin Yang, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-65002\" href=\"/dolph-lundgren/3040-65002/\" slug=\"dolph-lundgren\">Dolph Lundgren's</a> barely-intelligible sniper Gunner Jensen, or <a data-ref-id=\"3040-102289\" href=\"/terry-crews/3040-102289/\" slug=\"terry-crews\">Terry Crews</a>' gigantic shotgun-toting jokester, Hale Caesar. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-70379\" href=\"/jason-statham/3040-70379/\" slug=\"jason-statham\">Jason Statham</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-90967\" href=\"/randy-couture/3040-90967/\" slug=\"randy-couture\">Randy Couture</a> are sadly nowhere to be found, but that's really the least of The Expendables 2's problems.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The real problem here is mechanics. For a game based on the act of shooting things and sometimes making them explode, The Expendables 2 is remarkably dull when executing these seemingly basic tenets. A variety of factors contribute to this, but most notably, the controls are garbage. The developers at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3374\" href=\"/zootfly-llc/3010-3374/\" slug=\"zootfly-llc\">ZootFly</a> have attempted to meld the kind of perspective-oriented shooting of one of the more recent Contra titles with the aiming mechanics of a twin-stick shooter, like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-237\" href=\"/geometry-wars/3025-237/\" slug=\"geometry-wars\">Geometry Wars</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16194\" href=\"/smash-tv/3030-16194/\" slug=\"smash-tv\">Smash TV</a>. This does not work.</p><p style=\"\">It's hard to explain exactly why it doesn't work without digging into that nebulous concept of \"feel.\" Shooting things in The Expendables 2 feels weak. The guns have no real impact, the constant need to upgrade them throughout the game means that at least half the game will be spent with long reload times and very little ammo, and there's just not a damn smidgen of excitement anywhere to be found in the combat.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2247950-tanks.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2247950\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2247950-tanks.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2247950\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2247950-tanks.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The gameplay is somewhere between Contra and bullet hell, but it never quite finds a sweet spot between the two.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There are mechanical issues as well. The control scheme of aiming with the right analog stick and shooting with the R1 button works fine in most modern shooters, but here it's just awkward as hell. There's no aim lock mechanic, so basically you're just spraying bullets in directions in the hope of hitting stuff. Again, in a dual-stick shooter, that usually works. But because your guns are so weak-feeling through much of the game, it rarely feels like you're making much impact. When I'm playing as Hale Caesar and I've got that massive, otherworldly-looking automatic shotgun of his, I should be sending bad guys flying in multi-directional shards of human meat. That does not happen here.</p><p style=\"\">Instead, you blast blast blast until everything on screen is dead. If you're playing in co-op, you'll manage to do this pretty quickly, even on the hardcore difficulty. If you're playing with AI-controlled bots, then it'll take a bit longer, because they're idiots. They'll shoot, but their accuracy and rate of fire tends to be a lot lower than yours, and they will attempt to use the ill-conceived cover mechanic more than you will. Yes, using cover will usually block you from being shot, but unless you're playing for extra XP points, it doesn't matter if you die. Most times one of your teammates will be able to run back and heal you, and if not, the checkpoint system doesn't force you to retrace much distance. In fact, in a weird twist, being down on the ground arguably makes you more useful to your team than otherwise. You can shoot with a pistol while grounded, and if you have even a halfway decent aim, you'll basically just pick guys off left and right, while taking no damage. It's like you're a human turret.</p><p style=\"\">The Expendables 2 does little to capitalize on the wonderfully stupid action movie nostalgia inherent to the films. Not that the characters were particularly fleshed out in the movies, but here they're barely given anything to talk about that isn't a badly delivered, even more poorly edited one-liner. Only Crews and Lundgren voice their own characters, and it's pretty obvious that they were only in the recording booth long enough to say their lines once and collect their checks. The guy who does Jet Li's voice borders on offensive, and the actor pretending to be Barney does an even worse Stallone impression than I do.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2247942-boat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2247942\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2247942-boat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2247942\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2247942-boat.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2247942-boat.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yes, there are turret sequences. Of course there are turret sequences.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">What little plot there is barely acknowledges itself. At some point it's explained that you're on the hook to rescue a Chinese diplomat, or something. In order to do that, and collect your $1 million reward (that money wouldn't even cover the damage costs of the first level), you have to kill <i>thousands</i> of people. That's not an exaggeration. That certainly is in keeping with the spirit of the first movie, in which the stuntman credits greatly outnumbered the actual cast. And because of the sheer volume of bad guys you're fighting on screen, most battles become these bizarre, completely incomprehensible blasts of fire and bullets. You never know what you're hitting. As long as things are exploding and guys are falling backward in overly dramatic fashion, you're doing fine.</p><p style=\"\">Except you're not doing fine, because you've paid $15 for this bland, hopelessly rushed bore. Again, I've no doubt few of you are surprised by this result. Downloadable movie-licensed games have had a particularly rough run in recent years, so there's no reason why anyone should have expected anything from this game. And yet a twinge of dismay continuously stuck with me as I played through crappy level after crappy level of The Expendables 2. There's a fine idea for a game here, but either the talent or the budget (or both) wasn't there to make it work.

That night, the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1821\" href=\"/midnight-channel/3035-1821/\" slug=\"midnight-channel\">Midnight Channel</a> goes back on the air with an ad for a fighting tournament featuring the core players from Persona 4. Between that suspicious occurrence and the disappearance of a few of their members, the high-school students plunge back into the TV world to figure out what's going on. Inside they find a fighting tournament and a handful of strangers--key characters from Persona 3 and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-22415\" href=\"/labrys/3005-22415/\" slug=\"labrys\">Labrys</a>, an all-new character designed specifically for the game. As you might expect, much of the story is concerned with Labrys, who has direct connections to <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1341\" href=\"/aigis/3005-1341/\" slug=\"aigis\">Aigis</a> and other P3 characters. You'll also see her forge bonds with members of the P4 crew along the way. In short, it's a nifty bit of fan service that lets you check in on a few Persona 3 characters, who have grown up a bit, and the Persona 4 characters, who haven't really changed a whole lot, but again, only two months have passed since we last saw them in action.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2276389-full__7_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2276389\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2276389-full__7_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2276389\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33880/2276389-full__7_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can opt to put the whole game in Japanese, if that's your thing.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The story mode has you select one character at a time, and you'll see the events unfold from that character's perspective. You'll rarely fight in the story mode, and the battles you do encounter there are one-round affairs that feel like they're set on an easier difficulty setting than the rest of the game, almost as if the developers expected that people who might not play a lot of fighting games would be spending most of their time there. Outside of these sparse fights, Persona 4 Arena's story mode is a straight-up <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2029\" href=\"/visual-novel/3015-2029/\" slug=\"visual-novel\">visual novel</a>. Page after page of unvoiced text comes your way, usually in the form of your character's inner monologue. When you encounter another character, some spoken lines of dialogue show up, but even then your character is spewing out tons of lines in his or her head.</p><p style=\"\">If you honestly care about the universe and its characters, you'll probably take what you can get in whatever format you can get your hands on, but at times this story feels like it'd be better suited for a short manga series than a video game. You'll occasionally get an opportunity to choose one of two responses, leading to some very light branching, and you'll have to play up to a moment just before the story's climax with a number of characters before unlocking the characters that will tell you the whole tale. You'll also see the same three or four cutscenes more than a couple of times as you play through with multiple characters. It could be better... but as someone who was already hooked on the idea of hearing more about the Persona 4 cast I quickly became enthralled with learning more about how the Persona 3 fighters fit into all this. Either way, the story leaves things in an especially interesting spot that could make for some cool Persona sequels down the line. But maybe you don't care about any of this.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Outside of that story mode, Persona 4 Arena behaves like a \"normal\" fighting game. It has a lesson mode that teaches you the basics of P4A's various systems and mechanics. A challenge mode gives you combos for each character and, unlike a lot of other fighting games with similar modes, it'll demonstrate the combos to you in order to help you learn the appropriate timing. It also has an arcade mode, which boils the story down to its bare minimum, a versus mode, training, a gallery to hear all the voicework and view unlocked story art, and so on. It also has online play with the requisite lobby battle option that lets up to eight players congregate and fight. There's also a neat title system that lets you piece together unlocked words into your own silly, descriptive phrase. I went with \"Forbidden Honey-Roasted Romance.\"</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2276392-full__4_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2276392\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2276392-full__4_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2276392\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33880/2276392-full__4_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33880/2276392-full__4_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Unit #031 and Unit #024 share a quiet moment.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">P4A is a four-button game with special moves that are mostly easy to execute, even on a standard gamepad. It's heavily reliant on quarter-circle motions with only a few exceptions, and those are usually easy charge moves. There's even an auto-combo that comes out if you keep mashing the weak attack button, giving beginners some guaranteed damage if they can land it and giving more advanced players something to burst out of or avoid entirely. Though it's not quite as esoteric as some of Arc's other work, it's certainly more than just comboing crouching medium kicks into fireballs all day long. You can double jump, air dash, initiate mid-air turnarounds, and two of the attack buttons call out your character's Persona--just pretend I said \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-18647\" href=\"/jojos-bizarre-adventure/3030-18647/\" slug=\"jojos-bizarre-adventure\">stand</a>\" or \"weird spirit ghost\" if you're not sure what that is.</p><p style=\"\">The Persona comes out for some specials (<a data-ref-id=\"3005-6113\" href=\"/yukiko-amagi/3005-6113/\" slug=\"yukiko-amagi\">Yukiko</a> calls her Persona out to cast fire spells in your direction, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6112\" href=\"/yosuke-hanamura/3005-6112/\" slug=\"yosuke-hanamura\">Yosuke</a> calls upon his for wind attacks, and so on) and can be batted away with normal attacks, which can lead to a \"Persona break.\" It should suffice to say that it's more complicated and systems-heavy than the typical fighting game, but if you've gotten at all familiar with previous Arc games, you'll probably find it all to be at least somewhat self-explanatory. As a fighting game fan that tends to dodge games with a ton of various systems and mechanics, Persona 4 Arena is the most appealing and accessible game Arc has made in years--but then I can always fall back on the part of me that is still borderline obsessed with Persona 4 for comfort. Even after playing the heck out P4A and attempting to learn all the different systems I'm still finding myself getting absolutely eaten alive when playing online.</p><p style=\"\">The netcode in P4A seems fine on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a> and decidedly less fine on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">Xbox 360</a>. You may have seen this coming, as reports from Japan indicated that this was already a problem over there, but on the 360, this appears to manifest itself as a consistently awful second round. After one round of proper, decent-feeling fighting, round two seems to run at two-thirds of the normal speed for a bit before snapping back into action and finishing clean. Atlus claims a patch is on the way, but if you're making a choice right now, choose PS3. The PS3 version also has an optional install to help you speed up load times.</p><p style=\"\">So if it wasn't for the Persona hook, I doubt I'd stick with P4A... but it's a <i>hell</i> of a hook. Getting the opportunity to check in with these characters is a real treat, even if it comes as a wall of text. It's full of recognizable locations and familiar music from the Persona franchise, as well, which helps tie all the fan service together into a great little package. Alternately, if you're a fan of Arc's previous work, you'll probably have an enjoyable time with the fighting. But you should realize that these are pretty specific groups and this is a pretty specific recommendation. If you don't fall into one of those groups, you'll probably just find the whole thing confusing.</p>", "deck": "Whether you're interested in the Arc school of fighting game design or reading a Persona 4 visual novel set two months after the events of the real game, Persona 4 Arena has you covered.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-511/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36274/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/persona-4-arena/3030-36274/", "id": 36274, "name": "Persona 4 Arena"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-08-07 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115725/", "id": 115725, "name": "Persona 4 Arena"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/sound-shapes-review/1900-512/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Five years ago, an indie developer named <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89648\" href=\"/jonathan-mak/3040-89648/\" slug=\"jonathan-mak\">Jonathan Mak</a> brought <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9960\" href=\"/everyday-shooter/3030-9960/\" slug=\"everyday-shooter\">Everyday Shooter</a> to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-88\" href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/\" slug=\"playstation-network-ps3\">PlayStation Network</a>. These were the decidedly early days of PSN, and downloadable games in general hadn't become nearly as elaborate or interesting as they are today. And yet something about Everyday Shooter has endured with me over the years. I still go back to it from time to time, just to play a level or two and enjoy its off-kilter art style and bedroom rock-inspired music.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2290240-psv_sound_shapes_ssm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2290240\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56702412868633\" data-width=\"746\" style=\"width: 746px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2290240-psv_sound_shapes_ssm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2290240\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2290240-psv_sound_shapes_ssm2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A sentient, moving eyeball should probably be creepy, but this little guy is just too adorable.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I suspect I'll be doing the same thing with Sound Shapes, the latest game from Mak and his team of collaborators at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4391\" href=\"/queasy-games/3010-4391/\" slug=\"queasy-games\">Queasy Games</a>. Speaking in indie game terms, Sound Shapes is to Everyday Shooter what <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31772\" href=\"/journey/3030-31772/\" slug=\"journey\">Journey</a> was to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21120\" href=\"/flower/3030-21120/\" slug=\"flower\">Flower</a>. It's an evolution of design that's more self-assured, more cohesive, and frankly just a hell of a lot more fun.</p><p style=\"\">Sound Shapes explores the idea laid down by Everyday Shooter, namely the idea of creating an intrinsic connection between the action on the screen and the sounds you hear. This is a music game, but as with Everyday Shooter, the soundtrack is built almost entirely by the things you do in the game. By playing Sound Shapes, you build the soundtrack around you.</p><p style=\"\">You do this by controlling a rolling eyeball...thing. The eyeball has the ability to attach itself to any light-colored areas of the environment. Jumping up to a ceiling, for instance, will let you stick and roll around. Round objects let you roll around in circles, and so on. Along the way, you'll be collecting coins, which are essentially musical notes. Collecting them adds notes or sections of notes to an existing track built out of the level.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Levels are broken out into \"albums,\" which contain musical compositions created by artists as diverse as Superbrothers' Jim Guthrie, to Beck. Yes, <i>that</i> Beck. Each album has its own unique visual accompaniment. Guthrie's, for instance, uses an art style similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33139\" href=\"/superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/3030-33139/\" slug=\"superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep\">Sword &amp; Sworcery</a> while depicting a desperately bland corporate environment, while Beck's levels flit between everything from flaming cities to giant, unidentifiable oceans of green stuff that your eye guy can swim through.</p><p style=\"\">Though art and musical styles are varied, the mechanics of the game don't evolve too far beyond \"jump on things, and don't hit red things.\" Red stuff kills you, which is where Sound Shapes gets tricky. Levels are generally tricky in ways that you won't recognize right away, though the checkpoint system is such that you'll rarely have to backtrack much, if at all. Sound Shapes is far more interested in you being able to see a song/level to completion than you mastering some insidious bit of platforming sadism.</p><p style=\"\">To that end, Sound Shapes won't take too long to complete. There are only five albums in the game--six if you count the tutorial levels--each with between three and five levels. After a few hours, you'll likely have tried all of the levels at least once, but that's not really the \"end\" of the game, exactly. Leaderboards keep track of your level scores, and honestly, even if they weren't there, the levels are fun and trippy enough that you'll want to play through them a few times, at least. I certainly did.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2290270-sound_shapes_e3_2012_023_1338961115.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2290270\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2290270-sound_shapes_e3_2012_023_1338961115.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2290270\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2290270-sound_shapes_e3_2012_023_1338961115.jpg\"></a><figcaption>If nothing else, Sound Shapes is a prime example of why having a diverse color palette in your game is a very good thing.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">And then there's the matter of Sound Shapes' level creation tools. Completing levels gives you access to the various pieces of scenery, enemies, and other aesthetic elements to use for your own creation purposes. Level creation tools in games typically just give me a headache, but Sound Shapes employs a clever, easy-to-learn system that makes placement and design relatively easy. I was able to craft a few musically un-terrible levels in relatively short order just by playing around. If the early community levels I've toyed with thus far are any indication, those with more creative minds are bound to create some brilliant stuff.</p><p style=\"\">The level editor is perhaps the one area where the PSN and Vita versions of the game differ. In some respects, the Vita's editor is easier, in that you can use the front touch screen to just tap and drag items around the layout screen. The flip-side is that you also have to use the rear touch screen to shrink and expand objects, which I generally found pretty awkward. Otherwise, the two versions might as well be the same game. In fact, you get both versions with a single purchase, and your saves (theoretically) can sync up via Sony's cloud service. I say theoretically because I've had a nightmare of a time getting the cloud syncing to work thus far. Supposedly it will work at some point in the future, but not at the moment.</p><p style=\"\">That glitch aside, little of Sound Shapes did anything but put a doofy grin on my face. This is a game where visuals, audio, and mechanics sync up in a way that feels effortlessly organic. I'm sure the work put in to making it that way was anything but effortless, but it paid off. Sound Shapes is a reminder that great, creative things can be done in the music gaming genre.</p>", "deck": "Both aesthetically and mechanically, Sound Shapes is an absolute delight.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-512/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35505/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sound-shapes/3030-35505/", "id": 35505, "name": "Sound Shapes"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-08-10 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-118301/", "id": 118301, "name": "Sound Shapes"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/sleeping-dogs-review/1900-513/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-29441\" href=\"/sleeping-dogs/3030-29441/\" slug=\"sleeping-dogs\">Sleeping Dogs</a>, by all accounts, never should have made it to store shelves.

That makes sense, since Sleeping Dogs is largely a patchwork of ideas taken from other, more memorable such games. Car thievery, sometimes awkward gunplay, a plot rife with cliche and ludonarrative dissonance, a visual engine that often sacrifices detail in favor of size, and so on and so forth. However, those issues don't add up to a sum large enough to overshadow Sleeping Dogs' strengths, which are several.</p><p style=\"\">While it won't win any awards for originality, Sleeping Dogs' undercover cop tale is nonetheless one worth seeing through from start to finish. As Wei Shen, a Hong Kong-born, American-raised cop with some serious family issues, you find yourself tasked with infiltrating the notorious Sun On Yee sect of the Chinese triads. Shen, as voiced by Will Yun Lee, is either a man pushed to the edge of reason as he sinks deeper and deeper into a criminal world he can't control, or a total sociopath, depending on how you play the game.</p><p style=\"\">That isn't to say there's any player choice to speak of in Sleeping Dogs. And, in fact, some of that sociopathy bleeds into the main narrative as well. Presumably, Wei starts out as a guy just trying to do his job, working his way into the ranks of the triad by doing typical grunt foot soldier work (collecting protection money, beating up thugs, making veiled threats to innocent people), but after a few hours of story, you're already up to gunning down scads and scads of rival gangsters, running multiple triad businesses, and basically causing more property damage than a year's worth of monsoons.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The juxtaposition between Wei's job of serving the public trust and Wei's action of shooting, punching, and running over hundreds of people never quite balances out. It's easier to swallow when you're playing as a gangster or other morally flexible type, but Wei's status as a Hong Kong police officer makes it kind of hard to process the visual of him shooting out the tires of a cop car and watching it explode into a ball of fiery death.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/2278795-sd_0047.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2278795\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56154628687691\" data-width=\"983\" style=\"width: 983px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/2278795-sd_0047.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2278795\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12565/2278795-sd_0047.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hand-to-hand combat is typically terrible in open world games. Sleeping Dogs does it right.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Fortunately, the plot has just enough intrigue to hold your attention throughout. There are some genuinely surprising (and brutal) twists and turns throughout the campaign, and the voice talent is top notch. Lee is joined by a host of major actors, including <a data-ref-id=\"3040-102400\" href=\"/tom-wilkinson/3040-102400/\" slug=\"tom-wilkinson\">Tom Wilkinson</a>, Edison Chen, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-51369\" href=\"/lucy-liu/3040-51369/\" slug=\"lucy-liu\">Lucy Liu</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-90964\" href=\"/kelly-hu/3040-90964/\" slug=\"kelly-hu\">Kelly Hu</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-54757\" href=\"/james-hong/3040-54757/\" slug=\"james-hong\">James Hong</a>, Yunjun Kim, and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-102399\" href=\"/emma-stone/3040-102399/\" slug=\"emma-stone\">Emma Stone</a>. Occasional dead line readings aside, most of the actors get into the roles with suitable enthusiasm to keep you engrossed in the story. The only real bummer is that several of these actors are stuck with characters that disappear nearly as quickly as they arrive. It's especially true of the female actors, who are mostly relegated to brief \"girlfriend\" missions, where you quickly seduce, and then forget about women you meet during the course of the main plot. It sounds great on paper to have Emma Stone voicing your video game, but it's pretty lame that she only sticks around for two rather dull scenes.</p><p style=\"\">Even when the story sags, the atmosphere in Sleeping Dogs is top notch. The territory of Hong Kong is captured well in spirit, if not total accuracy. The world around you is more like a greatest-hits collection of notable Hong Kong landmarks, condensed into a smaller island that still offers plenty of narrow alleyways and bustling streets to explore. The graphics engine isn't overly impressive, and you'll see plenty of blurriness in the background visuals--less so if you're playing on a recent <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" slug=\"pc\">PC</a>. But when driving or running around, you don't necessarily notice it. The incandescent lighting, the blunt mixture of Cantonese and English often shouted in your direction, the hilly, often confusing streets of the city, it all feels authentic.</p><p style=\"\">Granted, most people's perception of Hong Kong comes from the region's action cinema. Fortunately, developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6705\" href=\"/united-front-games/3010-6705/\" slug=\"united-front-games\">United Front Games</a> has added a few stylistic touches that certainly play to memories of movies like <i>Infernal Affairs</i> and <i>Hard Boiled</i>. Most notable is the hand-to-hand combat, often a liability in games like these. Instead, this system is the game's greatest strength, mirroring Rocksteady's Batman games by employing timing-based counters and dynamic combos. It's a remarkably smooth-feeling combat system. Counters are intuitive, and the moves are actually pretty easy to remember, if sometimes a bit difficult to time. The game is good about spacing out new abilities over the course of the game, as well. So even as you near the game's end, you'll still have a few things to learn.</p><p style=\"\">There are environmental attacks as well. Brutal, savage ones that rival <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2242\" href=\"/the-punisher/3030-2242/\" slug=\"the-punisher\">The Punisher</a> in sheer nastiness. By simply dragging enemies over to a highlighted object and pressing a button, you can do everything from merely dumping an enemy into a dumpster, to grinding their face off with a miter saw. It's bloody, downright horrific stuff, the kind of thing that will undoubtedly elicit laughs of shocked delight for many, myself included. Those with less steely stomachs, however, might want to stick to the dumpsters.</p><p style=\"\">Gunplay is hit and miss, with a greater emphasis on miss. For the first half of the game, there actually are no guns. It's mentioned that Hong Kong is a place that simply doesn't have a lot of guns. Then, suddenly, there are a lot of guns. The shift from \"occasional pistol I don't really use\" to \"where is that goddamned machine gun because holy shit there are nine of those guys with automatic shotguns\" is rather abrupt, and perhaps unnecessary. You have the ability to slow down time while shooting, either by diving over cover spots or when driving. This does have a great look to it, as guys go flying backward, and cars cartoonishly fly into the air before exploding accordingly. But the aiming is underdeveloped, leading to a lot of guesswork when popping out from cover. It's the kind of thing where a snap-to function probably would have saved the day. As it is, you can get through gun fights okay, but it's not as much fun as it ought to be.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/2278799-sd_0054.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2278799\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56154628687691\" data-width=\"983\" style=\"width: 983px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/2278799-sd_0054.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2278799\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12565/2278799-sd_0054.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12565/2278799-sd_0054.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mrs. Chu must be remembered when \"Best New Character\" awards are given this year.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The core campaign runs maybe 10 hours, and features only a few dull missions amid 20-some-odd entertaining ones. The same can't be said for the game's various side ventures, which range from moderately amusing distractions to complete and utter wastes of time. You can do drug busts, which generally involve beating up some guys, participating in a lame hacking minigame, and running back to your apartment use the hacked police camera to bust drug dealers. It's exactly as annoyingly repetitive as it sounds. Or, perhaps you can do some of the help missions, which involve walking up to people on the street who inexplicably know you by name. Generally you cart them around the city, go beat up someone for them, or maybe chase someone down. Fine, but nothing to get excited about. There are street races, which come with a <i>Fast and the Furious-</i>lite subplot about street racers getting killed, but once that's wrapped up, they're not really worth doing any longer. And then there are the dates with the previously mentioned ladies, where you will take pictures of them, drive very fast for them, or do karaoke for them. The karaoke section is maybe the one side venture of value, since it accurately represents the aural hell that is being in a karaoke bar while stone cold sober.</p><p style=\"\">So perhaps Sleeping Dogs isn't one of those games you'll want to keep on playing long after you've seen its story's conclusion.

It sparked a lot of conversation about the blurry line between the honorable homage and the straight-up jack move, and it felt like most folks ended up on the homage side of the line. Honestly, it was easy to feel that way because Darksiders was a really good game. So how do you produce a sequel to all that? Rather than staring at someone else's playbook, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6304\" href=\"/vigil-games/3010-6304/\" slug=\"vigil-games\">Vigil Games</a> has taken the core ideas of the original Darksiders and built upon them in a natural way. You can still pick out a few things here and there that tie it to the products of gaming's past, but those inspirations aren't quite as clear cut, making <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29941\" href=\"/darksiders-ii/3030-29941/\" slug=\"darksiders-ii\">Darksiders II</a> feel like a smart, original evolution of the previous game's concepts with plenty of new things to see and do, from its new protagonist to its faster combat and engaging loot system.</p><p style=\"\">In Darksiders II you play as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11419\" href=\"/death/3005-11419/\" slug=\"death\">Death</a>, one of the <i>other</i> four horsemen of the apocalypse. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-997\" href=\"/war/3005-997/\" slug=\"war\">War</a>, the \"hero\" of the last game, isn't too popular in this battle between angels and demons, and Death is out to clear War's name and, assuming he can figure out the logistics, resurrect humanity along the way. You'll have a better time with the game if you're at least somewhat familiar with the original game's story, though if you're hazy on the facts, the game references just enough of them to bring you back up to speed. But other than setting out to put right the things that went wrong in the previous game, Darksiders II feels like its own adventure. The ties to the previous game feel more like nice bonuses for people who played that game than absolutely crucial details. Instead, much of the game deals with Death's attempts to reach the Tree of Life and/or the Well of Souls, powerful places that are said to be capable of bringing all of humanity back to life--the blame for that action currently lies at War's feet, after all. Of course, it's not exactly a simple A-to-B-to-C sort of story.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2212861-7199darksidersiionlinecrowfather.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2212861\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2212861-7199darksidersiionlinecrowfather.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2212861\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2212861-7199darksidersiionlinecrowfather.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Crowfather holds many secrets, and he's a key figure in Death's adventure.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Everyone wants something and no one's going to help out a horseman for free. So like any other proper video game protagonist, you're going to spend most of the 20-25 hours helping out the people around you. It starts by getting a forge going and discovering that much of the world in Darksiders II is overcome by corruption. This force is creeping across all the realms, infecting enemies and even the land itself, which is peppered with glowing rock formations that can be destroyed with bomb flowers. You'll work your way through multiple realms, each with its own version of the Tree of Life (or Death, as the case may be) and its own unique landscape and features. The story pushes you from one quest giver to the next, and everyone seems to have a few things for you to collect, be it the two keys, three parts of a staff, and so on. Though the story may be pretty straightforward, the dialogue is well-written and acted well, giving the game a weighty feel, overall.</p><p style=\"\">Getting around the world is made easy via a very lax fast travel system, which has positive and negative impacts on the world. It's great to not have to ride your horse across huge, empty areas just to get to where you're going, but fast traveling from the realm's shopkeeper to the dungeon you're currently fighting through and back again robs the world of its sense of scale. It's almost certainly a gigantic world when compared to the first Darksiders--but it doesn't feel especially big, moreso if you're not focusing on every single one of the game's side quests, which can add a substantial number of hours to your play time.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Combat is fast and offers an upgradable combo system that makes it about more than just mashing the buttons, though if you're properly equipped and have spent your skill points in a complimentary way, mashing the buttons works pretty well around 95 percent of the time. Much of the combat focuses on landing a bunch of hits and dodging out of the way when a counterattack is headed in your direction. But if you've got faster weapons equipped and carefully curate your statistics to keep your health up and enemies staggered, combat is never a chore. Even many of the game's boss fights don't require specific mechanics to succeed, so you can skip the tricks and face your enemies head-on, if you like. Many of those boss battles get a lot easier if you're thinking outside of the box, though. One section of the adventure attempts to change things up by turning the game into a third-person shooter, but the camera system and controls just weren't built for this feat, making the entire section feel pretty terrible. It's one of the few blemishes in Darksiders II.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11165/2292566-2012_08_13_00003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2292566\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11165/2292566-2012_08_13_00003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2292566\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11165/2292566-2012_08_13_00003.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11165/2292566-2012_08_13_00003.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The menu screens are a little sluggish in the console versions of the game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As you kill, you earn experience points and gain levels. This earns you skill points that are spent on a two-sided skill tree, with one set of abilities focuses on direct damage and strength increases and the other offering a more magical route of spawnable ghouls that fight by your side, defensive bonuses, and crows that show up to attack on your behalf. Yet another meter controls your ability to activate \"reaper mode,\" which turns death into a large, more traditional take on the Grim Reaper that swings scythes around and does more damage. It's neat, but sort of a mess, as it's usually difficult to make out what the hell is going on. Just keep the Z-targeting button held down and mash the attacks, everything will be fine.</p><p style=\"\">Some of the game's loot is also keyed to your character level, but the loot that drops is usually right at your level, so cases where you're picking up something you can't use yet are few and far between. There are several armor points on Death, so you can equip shoulders, a chest piece, boots, arm wraps, and a talisman. Death's primary weapon is always a set of scythes, but you can equip different secondary weapons, like huge hammers, maces, and axes or smaller arm blades that deal fast damage. The loot is color-coded and comes with a lot of different statistical bonuses, like \"thorns\" and \"health on crit\" or more standard upgrades like strength and defensive upgrades. The game also has a weapon upgrade system that lets you take special possessed weapons and level them up by feeding your other weapons to them. As you feed a possessed weapon, it increases in power and inherits some of your old weapons' special abilities. So if you have stats that you really prefer, you can feed those stats to a possessed weapon to keep it growing in a set direction. It's a cool system that makes each piece of loot meaningful, but if your playthrough is anything like mine, you'll probably only find two or three possessed weapons over the course of the game. Since possessed weapons cap out after leveling up five times, you'll eventually reach a point where you have no more abilities to buy, no more weapons to feed, and no real reason to keep collecting inferior loot at all, since it's so easy to earn money as you play. I finished the game with more money than I could ever reasonably spend and nothing to spend it on other than the occasional health potion.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2204378-darksidersii_msft_makerelder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2204378\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2204378-darksidersii_msft_makerelder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2204378\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2204378-darksidersii_msft_makerelder.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2204378-darksidersii_msft_makerelder.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Here's yet another key for you to collect and take on your trip.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Though Death isn't as bulky as War was, the Darksiders visual style remains intact. Even the townsfolk and shopkeepers in this world look incredibly tough and thick. But the game never lets its tone fall too far into generically grimdark territory. There's a lot of great design and art to look at as you work your way through the realms. The technical side of Darksiders II isn't as laudable, especially on consoles, where the frame rate gets rough when the action picks up and little things like shadow detail are noticeably drawing in as you run around. The PC version is a sharper, better looking game, but people who like to go overboard on the options will find Darksiders II's lack of checkboxes and sliders to be a little disappointing.</p><p style=\"\">The adventure has its rough spots and the technical issues are disappointing, but these are relatively small issues in the grand scheme of things.

Whether it's a film, music, or literature, many of our most revered talents poured much of themselves into the works that made them so recognizable. So why do we not necessarily expect the same of games? Without diving into that obnoxious, self-indulgent argument of whether or not games can be Art, one can simply say that for many, many years, games have been seen by many--including some of those who help make them--as purely fluff entertainment. Sure, our best games have often come from designers who injected a bit of themselves into what you ended up playing, but outside of a few rare cases, most games have seemed largely content to be viewed as simple entertainment software, meant to be purchased, consumed, and essentially left behind once the next big thing comes along.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2295409-monster_fruit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2295409\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54487179487179\" data-width=\"1872\" style=\"width: 1872px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2295409-monster_fruit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2295409\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2295409-monster_fruit.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Quico and Monster have a friendship, albeit a troubled one.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-35512\" href=\"/papo-yo/3030-35512/\" slug=\"papo-yo\">Papo &amp; Yo</a> isn't content to be mere software. As the debut game from indie studio <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7632\" href=\"/minority-media-inc/3010-7632/\" slug=\"minority-media-inc\">Minority Media</a> and its founder, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-58012\" href=\"/vanderlei-caballero/3040-58012/\" slug=\"vanderlei-caballero\">Vander Caballero</a>, Papo &amp; Yo explores themes often left to \"heavier\" entertainment media, but does so in a way that tries to marry whimsical, childlike fantasy to its tragic underpinnings. When it works, Papo &amp; Yo is unlike anything I've played before, a heartfelt allegory of a painful childhood experience depicted in equal measure with traditional storytelling and the mechanics of gameplay. Unfortunately, there are as many instances where Papo &amp; Yo doesn't quite work, where the metaphors and the mechanics don't sync up, leaving the player in stilted, awkward circumstances that disengage you from the experience.</p><p style=\"\">Few of those issues rear their head in the game's early goings, where you are introduced to Quico, a South American boy who finds himself in a strange, fantastical world. Though this world features many of the abject elements of slum life, Quico is surprisingly adept at manipulating it. More on that later.</p><p style=\"\">Quico is joined by a pair of strange friends. Lula is a sentient toy robot who periodically helps out with solving puzzles, while Monster is precisely what he sounds like. The pink-skinned, multi-horned Monster is a peculiar creature. At times, he's a little like <i>Labyrinth</i>'s lumbering Ludo, a simple-minded but pleasant giant that tags along for the ride. At others, he's a literal flaming psychopath, hellbent on attacking anything in his path.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Caballero has made no secret that Quico and Monster's relationship is based upon his own relationship with his father, who was an abusive alcoholic. In this case, Monster is addicted to frogs. He eats them, and suddenly his demeanor shifts from chummy to enraged. Your task as Quico is to find ways to push the decidedly lazy Monster through the game's world while simultaneously trying to manage and hopefully cure his addiction.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2295413-papoyo_newmonsterangry.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2295413\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54472843450479\" data-width=\"1878\" style=\"width: 1878px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2295413-papoyo_newmonsterangry.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2295413\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2295413-papoyo_newmonsterangry.jpg\"></a><figcaption>When Monster becomes angry, it's not a pretty sight. And not just because the frame rate tanks.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's not often you're faced with an allegory as heavy as that when playing a video game. Undoubtedly the process of trying to combine such barbed themes with a world and play style that effectively takes some of the stinging edge off is a complicated one. To try and tackle this, Minority has crafted Papo &amp; Yo as a lightweight puzzle platformer, rooted in simple jumping and switch-finding puzzles that don't so much challenge as briefly distract.</p><p style=\"\">The puzzles are meant to be unobtrusive to the player, but in their simplicity, unintended complications arise. This is especially true of the game's middle sections, which rely more on the puzzle solving elements than the narrative. Throughout the game, you follow around a mysterious girl who may or may not have the key to solving Monster's ills. She draws doors, switches, gears, and all manner of other gadgetry on the walls in chalk outlines. These chalk outlines become three-dimensional objects somehow, and Quico is able to manipulate them.</p><p style=\"\">Trouble is, that's really all Quico has to do. You enter a level, see the highlighted sections that need to be interacted with, and pretty much just do that until you're out of things to interact with. The only real challenge before you is jumping up to those places. Not because the jumps are difficult to parse, but because the controls are simply too loose to jump anywhere with precision. The whole purpose of Papo &amp; Yo's simplistic design seems to be to keep the player focused on the world around them, but the loose handling forces the player to focus for all the wrong reasons. Instead of taking in the details of the environment, you're hyperfocused on some ledge or rooftop that you keep missing because the controls can't easily get you there.</p><p style=\"\">Technical glitches and bugs have a tendency to get in the way as well. The frame rate can be dodgy, and there's no shortage of screen-tearing glitches to be found, but those are the kinds of forgivable things you can ignore when you're truly engaged with a game. Less forgivable are the bugs that sometimes take you right out of the game and force you to restart progress. Some of the bugs I experienced were fixed via a day-one patch, but others stuck around, including a couple of reproduceable world progress glitches that required a restart to fix.</p><p style=\"\">These issues are less of a problem in the early and late goings of Papo &amp; Yo, because these are the areas where the puzzle-solving largely gives way to the story. Caballero once told me in an interview that his ultimate goal was to tell his stories using mechanics, and in these sections, the story is told effectively. Quico's exploration of his imaginary world effortlessly blends into the gameplay, mixing metaphors and interactivity in a way that's simply beautiful. It's especially true of the end, which I will only say provides a pointed, heartbreaking catharsis to the events that have come before.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2295407-highres_screenshot_00001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2295407\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.53020833333333\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2295407-highres_screenshot_00001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2295407\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2295407-highres_screenshot_00001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2295407-highres_screenshot_00001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Even with its flaws, Quico's imaginary world is worth visiting.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is not a game afraid to hide its pain, though it does occasionally have issues expressing that pain with clarity. It's something that nagged at me throughout Papo &amp; Yo, specifically the relationship between Quico and Monster. Monster, by all appearances, is meant to be a friendly character, someone that Quico loves and shows affection toward. However, the game's story doesn't always use this relationship to great effect. Too often Monster is simply a tool you use to get to the next level section, or something you have to calm down to avoid injury. While there are moments where Monster will occasionally step in to rescue Quico from some peril, too often Monster feels like a means to an end, rather than a full-fledged character to attach to. He's less a best friend than a looming, undefined presence. It's possible that's true to Caballero's experience with his father, but without a more identifiable attachment to Monster, it's tougher than it ought to be to connect with the emotions the story actively pushes you toward.</p><p style=\"\">Which isn't to say you won't be affected by it at all. It might not dig as deep as it seemingly could have, and the technical issues are perhaps a bit too prevalent to ignore, but in an age where indie games are finally beginning to bloom as a way to experiment with narrative, Papo &amp; Yo still feels like a brave step forward into uncharted territory. And as with all first steps, it's something of a clumsy one, perhaps unsure of itself and its own limitations. Caballero and his team have crafted something in Papo &amp; Yo that I believe is a wholly worthwhile experience, if not an entirely successful one. They've shown that they lack neither the creativity nor the conviction to push gaming to more personal, more uncomfortable spaces. And even if the first fruit of that labor turned out flawed, the ideas behind it are still worth cheering for.</p>", "deck": "Minority Media's debut game is at once a beautiful, affecting tale of childhood tragedy, and a generally lackluster puzzle platformer.

Just when I thought I couldn't stand to play another multiplayer game with level progression and unlocks, along comes <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33020\" href=\"/hybrid/3030-33020/\" slug=\"hybrid\">Hybrid</a> with a less-is-more approach that subtracts freedom of movement and gains an increased importance on tactics and positioning as a result. You're still going to pull one trigger to aim at enemies and the other trigger to shoot them, but enough of the gameplay around that basic shooting feels original to make Hybrid worth checking out.</p><p style=\"\">Except for the one key difference, Hybrid is like every other shooter on the market. Aim at guy, shoot guy. Occasionally activate your secondary ability to teleport, see enemies through walls, or heal nearby teammates. Check your kill-death ratio afterward and feel a deep sense of shame. And every few matches, gain a level that lets you unlock a new weapon, ability, passive buff, or helmet to use in subsequent matches. But it's that one difference--the inability to just run freely around the map--that gives Hybrid its unique identity. At all times you're stuck to one of only a handful of predefined cover points on a given map, and your only freedom of movement is to sidle back and forth behind the cover, flip over to the other side of it, or jetpack your way to one of the other cover points that you've got a direct line of sight to.</p><p style=\"\">Since there's only a small number of places you, your teammates, and all your enemies can be at any one time, where you are in relation to where everyone else is becomes of extreme importance over the course of each match. Things like flanking an enemy position from two sides or circling around the back way to creep up on someone who isn't paying attention become regular matters of course. You also have to learn how to make the best use of your limited movement, by knowing when to do things like charge someone's position and wildly blind-fire at them from the other side of their own cover, or hit the retreat button and hurtle backwards to get away from someone who's about to kill you. The matches have a unique flow to them in an online-shooter context, especially since the three-versus-three match size is notably small.</p><p style=\"\">Hybrid goes a step beyond the typical multiplayer-progression metagame with a second layer of between-match progress that takes every player's performance collectively into account. It's a persistent war spread across the entire world's geography, where you pick between multiple zones on every continent before you start matchmaking into a game. Winning matches in a particular zone advances your faction's progress in that zone, and the first team to hit 100 percent there earns double the points of the other side (who still has to hit 100 itself before a single point is awarded).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2117856-hybrid01_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2117856\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2117856-hybrid01_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2117856\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2117856-hybrid01_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Knowing when to retreat is an important part of surviving most confrontations.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It was pretty exciting in the first few days of release to see my faction struggling to pull ahead of the other guys in the point totals, though it got a bit less exciting once they gained what looked like an unrecoverable lead over us. Lo and behold, my side ended up winning the first season after all, due to more strategically targeting low-traffic zones rather than focusing on a smaller number of high-value ones. It's a shame there's no sort of in-game bulletin board for members of a faction to coordinate their efforts, or at least a better at-a-glance way to highlight the most contentious zones; as it is, you have to drill way down on the map to see which areas you should focus on. But the persistent war is still a cool idea that gives you a reason to stick with the game for a relatively long period of time.</p><p style=\"\">Actually, the very beginning of Hybrid's release was pretty much a complete disaster, as a server outage rendered the game completely unplayable on day one. That problem was fixed in a few hours, but it's worth noting that the same thing could theoretically happen again in the future. The matchmaking can also be pretty slow, and coupled with the long loading times, sometimes it feel like it takes forever to get into a match. (The game uses a neat trick of pitting you against \"traitors\" from your own faction when it can't pull a team full of enemies, at least.) Also, while every weapon and ability in the game is unlockable purely by leveling, and the leveling curve isn't any slower than any other game of this type, you can also spend real money to unlock whatever you want right away, or to give yourself an experience buff. That feels a little gross. It's made worse since the type of weapon or ability you unlock at each level is fixed, and there's no way to test out a weapon before you burn an unlock on it, which in a couple of cases led to me going for a weapon that sounded cool but which I immediately ended up hating. After you pick, say, a new shotgun, it's going to be several hours of leveling before you get a chance at another shotgun, unless you want to pay hard cash.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Hybrid's peripheral shortcomings are easy enough to ignore, though, since the core idea is so well executed. Even if you thought you couldn't prestige again to save your life, the game feels different enough from the pack to be worth your time. In the highly specific category of inexpensive downloadable multiplayer Xbox shooters, it's one of the best things going.</p>", "deck": "Hybrid's less-is-more approach somehow makes shooting other players on an Xbox feel sort of new again.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-516/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33020/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/hybrid/3030-33020/", "id": 33020, "name": "Hybrid"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-08-23 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115063/", "id": 115063, "name": "Hybrid"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dust-an-elysian-tail-review/1900-517/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127085-still_06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1127085\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127085-still_06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1127085\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1127085-still_06.png\"></a><figcaption>Dust's heart is its exceptionally fast-paced and responsive combo-based fighting system.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">On first glance, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27691\" href=\"/dust-an-elysian-tail/3030-27691/\" slug=\"dust-an-elysian-tail\">Dust: An Elysian Tail</a> looks like it has a little bit of everything. There's a responsive, lightning-fast combat system that lets you juggle enemies, suplex them out of the air, or combo them several screens high. You've got a full raft of RPG mechanics, so you can level up and distribute skill points, and equip armor and items that buff different attributes and add effects like health regen or increased drop rates. The equipment system goes a step further with a full crafting system that lets you build even better stuff than you can buy, and there's a ton of other peripheral secrets to discover in your travels. All these mechanics are gathered together in service of a memorable, well written storyline, and swaddled in some of the most lavishly produced 2D video game art seen anytime lately.</p><p style=\"\">The core of what makes Dust so rewarding is the quality and immediacy of the combat. You start out with basic abilities to do things like pop enemies up into the air or dash behind them and do a turnaround attack, and soon you get a sword-twirling trick called the dust storm that allows you to juggle multiple enemies, and also amplify the spells spewed by your little flying rodent whatsit <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24143\" href=\"/fidget/3005-24143/\" slug=\"fidget\">Fidget</a> into screen-clearing dervishes of magical destruction. Using all your juggles and spells and other combat moves effectively will net you combo hit counts well into the hundreds, which is especially useful since you earn bonus experience for solid combos. Dust's feedback loop of combat and character progression makes you constantly feel like you're becoming more powerful all the way up to the last minutes of the game, and the controls are so quick and responsive that it just gets more and more fun as you start laying waste to a dozen enemies at a time with ever increasing style.</p><p style=\"\">The game has picked up a reputation as a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\" href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" slug=\"metroidvania\">Metroidvania</a> game, and Dust does have the grid-like map that's the hallmark of that sort of game, but the similarities to something like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26706\" href=\"/shadow-complex/3030-26706/\" slug=\"shadow-complex\">Shadow Complex</a> are partially superficial. Dust doesn't offer a single contiguous world that you can navigate from end to end, but rather a bunch of different smaller areas that you warp between on a world map. And once you get inside one of those areas, the graph-paper map doesn't follow your every move; each map square only corresponds to an entire \"screen\" that might take you five minutes to work your way across. That expectation of using the map to pinpoint exactly where I was at all times kind of threw me for a loop when I first started playing Dust, since you still end up fumbling your way around a good bit within complex screens, but once you unlock the world map and get a feel for how everything is put together, the game makes perfect sense. It helps that Dust does share that central Metroidvania conceit of taunting you with areas you obviously don't have access to early on, then doling out abilities like a slide and double jump later on that give you access to those areas, giving you a lot of reason to backtrack.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127079-still_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1127079\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127079-still_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1127079\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1127079-still_00.png\"></a><figcaption>There's plenty of story and side quests to keep you busy for at least a dozen hours.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Actually, I was surprised how much time I wanted to sink into going back and looking for secrets. The game is chock-a-block with hidden treasure chests that hold most of the best items and crafting recipes in the game, and a lot of those chests are very well hidden in clever places in the environment. Those are just the nuts-and-bolts secrets, though. What's even more memorable are the dozen notable characters taken from other Xbox Live Arcade indie games that are deeply hidden throughout Dust's expansive levels. It takes a lot of work to find some of these guys--one of the solutions had me getting a clue from a note I found in a completely different area, then kneeling in a specific spot like I was playing <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11820\" href=\"/castlevania-ii-simons-quest/3030-11820/\" slug=\"castlevania-ii-simons-quest\">Simon's Quest</a> all of a sudden--and they reward you with health bonuses when you find them. More importantly, you really have to see for yourself the amount of detail and craft that went into making each secret character's area feel visually and thematically consistent with the games they're taken from. Dust goes to the extreme lengths of changing its own art style, visual presentation, and mechanics in some cases to emulate and pay homage to these other standout downloadable games, the ranks of which this game is likely to join in the near future.</p><p style=\"\">Aside from the secret stuff, Dust has a good 10 or more hours of pure story and side content, including a bunch of optional quests you can pick up from friendly characters in multiple towns. The game becomes occupied with some fairly dark themes, as you delve into the story of the skilled warrior <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24144\" href=\"/dust/3005-24144/\" slug=\"dust\">Dust</a> who, together with Fidget and his ancient talking sword, sets out on a quest to figure out who he is and where he came from. Yes, an amnesiac protagonist--I can hear you rolling your eyes from here. But the game's finely crafted storytelling efforts keep that clichéd premise from feeling out of place, even as the nature of the truth becomes more and more grim. The game encompasses a broader scope the more you play, as you realize who's involved in the central mystery and how much is at stake, and the story ultimately reaches a more satisfying and emotionally resonant conclusion than most 60 dollar retail games I can think of.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127083-still_04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1127083\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1127083-still_04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1127083\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1127083-still_04.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1127083-still_04.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The soft focus and fluid animation are awfully easy on the eyes.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At the same time, Dust is almost paradoxically bursting with an ebullient brand of charm. There's a ton of referential and self-aware humor that makes light of video game conventions in general and a number of memorable games in particular. (The very first item you pick up is an amusing reference to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14216\" href=\"/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/3030-14216/\" slug=\"castlevania-symphony-of-the-night\">Symphony of the Night</a>, which is a clear influence here.) The game tastefully knows not to lean too heavily on this stuff, ensuring that it never crosses the line and becomes too cloying or corny. Dust juggles light and dark in a way that makes it easy for you to feel good about, even if you haven't spent any time seriously considering talking animal characters since the last time you watched <i><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090633/\" rel=\"nofollow\">An American Tail</a></i> or Disney's <i><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx_4C1cyUZA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robin Hood</a></i>. All this is enhanced by a cast of excellent voice actors who do both the jokes and the plot a service, giving uniformly well considered line readings that make you feel like someone who really knew and cared about the material was sitting there directing them the whole time.</p><p style=\"\">That Dust is largely the work of one lone developer makes it all the more impressive, but the circumstances of the game's development aren't even a consideration when you consider how good the game is at face value. Cramming this many elements into a single downloadable game seems like an audacious move, but Dust pulls it off with confidence, style, and heart, resulting in a game that deserves to be played by a lot of people.</p>", "deck": "Deep and involving mechanics, lavish, fluid artwork, and an emotionally resonant storyline--Dust pretty much has it all.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-517/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27691/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dust-an-elysian-tail/3030-27691/", "id": 27691, "name": "Dust: An Elysian Tail"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-08-20 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117911/", "id": 117911, "name": "Dust: An Elysian Tail"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/transformers-fall-of-cybertron-review/1900-518/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/2241642-458132_10151060070405097_2083194722_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2241642\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2048\" style=\"width: 2048px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/2241642-458132_10151060070405097_2083194722_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2241642\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28314/2241642-458132_10151060070405097_2083194722_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Metroplex shows up for a little bit to let you launch some airstrikes.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You'd think that <a data-ref-id=\"3025-262\" href=\"/transformers/3025-262/\" slug=\"transformers\">Transformers</a> would be one of those home run/slam dunk sort of properties that would be able to turn out fantastic video games. But a brief visit to a list of every Transformers game results in a whole lot of sadness. The reasons why are perhaps a bit outside the scope of this review, but it sets the stage for what's to follow. We're dealing with a pretty low bar here. 2010's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29405\" href=\"/transformers-war-for-cybertron/3030-29405/\" slug=\"transformers-war-for-cybertron\">War for Cybertron</a>, thus, quickly became one of the best Transformers games ever made, despite having a load of issues. Now, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4954\" href=\"/high-moon-studios-inc/3010-4954/\" slug=\"high-moon-studios-inc\">High Moon</a> have created a follow-up with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-36634\" href=\"/transformers-fall-of-cybertron/3030-36634/\" slug=\"transformers-fall-of-cybertron\">Fall of Cybertron</a>, a game that improves upon the developer's past work. But it's still a pretty lackluster shooter that doesn't perk up until the end, and it's only truly suited for people who are fiending for a Transformers game.</p><p style=\"\">Like its predecessor, Fall of Cybertron is a third-person shooter--or at least it is when you're in robot form. You plod around metallic environments, like a big robot should, taking aim at scads of nameless robot fodder with the left trigger and gunning them to bits with the right. Though you'll play as a number of different <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5006\" href=\"/autobots/3015-5006/\" slug=\"autobots\">Autobots</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5007\" href=\"/decepticons/3015-5007/\" slug=\"decepticons\">Decepticons</a> over the course of the game's campaign, the robot forms don't feel terribly different. Rather than going with custom weaponry for each character, you can pick up weapons from the battlefield. So the weapons feel like the sort of firearms you'd be likely to find in this sort of game, giving you sci-fi equivalents of burst-fire rifles, fully automatic assault rifles, shotguns, and rocket launchers. The heavy weapons, though much more limited on ammo, give you different effects, including one gun that forces an enemy to fight for your team, another that causes corrosive damage, and so on. The robot forms do, however, get a character-specific ability. So when you're playing as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2964\" href=\"/jazz/3005-2964/\" slug=\"jazz\">Jazz</a>, you'll have a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29393\" href=\"/grappling-hook/3030-29393/\" slug=\"grappling-hook\">grappling hook</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-23244\" href=\"/cliffjumper/3005-23244/\" slug=\"cliffjumper\">Cliffjumper</a> can <a data-ref-id=\"3015-11\" href=\"/cloak/3015-11/\" slug=\"cloak\">cloak</a> himself. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-151\" href=\"/optimus-prime/3005-151/\" slug=\"optimus-prime\">Optimus Prime</a> can mark targets and call in <a data-ref-id=\"3005-23441\" href=\"/metroplex/3005-23441/\" slug=\"metroplex\">Metroplex</a> in some sequences for an airstrike. Some of the abilities double-up, though. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1786\" href=\"/starscream/3005-1786/\" slug=\"starscream\">Starscream</a>, for example, can also cloak himself.</p><p style=\"\">To make all those abilities work properly, the game locks specific Transformers to specific levels. So the Jazz level is specifically designed with a lot of grapple activity in mind. The Vortex level is primarily meant to be experienced in vehicle form, since he's a helicopter/jet in that form. The vehicle forms are where the different characters get a little more unique. The aforementioned Vortex has a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-288\" href=\"/gatling-gun/3055-288/\" slug=\"gatling-gun\">Gatling gun</a> and powerful bombs when he's a vehicle. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2175\" href=\"/megatron/3005-2175/\" slug=\"megatron\">Megatron</a>, a hover tank, simply has his one big cannon, but it feels like it's more powerful than just about anything else in the entire game. You can transform back and forth just about anywhere, but the game usually makes it pretty clear when you're expected to turn into your vehicle form. Driving through the game's corridors ends up being sort of a hassle, because the floaty hovering and strafing that every ground-based ride is saddled with isn't much fun to control.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/74829/2217191-461340_337759169627617_146805978722938_835457_1486838296_o_1338232642.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2217191\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/74829/2217191-461340_337759169627617_146805978722938_835457_1486838296_o_1338232642.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2217191\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74829/2217191-461340_337759169627617_146805978722938_835457_1486838296_o_1338232642.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll stomp a number of Insecticons during the campaign.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That's probably the larger problem here. The act of moving around these environments and carrying out your tasks really isn't much fun. There's no cover system in Fall of Cybertron. That's not to say that <i>every</i> third-person shooter absolutely must have a cover system, but instead of coming up with some clever alternative, the answer is to simply manually stand behind objects, which obstructs your view to the point where the developers had to put in and then emphasize a \"switch your shooting hand\" button that swaps the camera view. This is one of the problems that dedicated cover systems are sort of designed to fix. It certainly doesn't help that, throughout much of the game, you'll see robots from both factions hiding behind cover. Are your robots simply too proud to hide?</p><p style=\"\">Maybe it'd be a little easier to stand if the robots weren't so frail. When you think of Megatron you think of an unstoppable force that shreds through lesser Transformers like they were Gobots. Instead all it takes is two nameless, identity-less shotgun-toting robots to get a little too close and let loose and you're forced to reload your last checkpoint. The game only stops to get its power fantasy on when you're controlling <a data-ref-id=\"3005-21909\" href=\"/bruticus/3005-21909/\" slug=\"bruticus\">Bruticus</a> and, in a chapter that's been shown off quite a bit prior to the game's release, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-21800\" href=\"/grimlock/3005-21800/\" slug=\"grimlock\">Grimlock</a>. The Grimlock chapter comes late in the game and puts you in control of a Transformer that can't transform at will. And instead of shooting the same small handful of weapons at all your enemies, Grimlock carries a sword. The melee doesn't feel great and when you do build up a rage meter of sorts and get into your dinosaur form, maneuvering and lining up your attacks feels cumbersome rather than cool. It's the sort of style change that <i>should</i> be a cool payoff... but it isn't.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Instead, the actual payoff comes in the final chapter. It's an incredibly dynamic piece of action that has you quickly bolting from one character to the next as the Decepticons attempt to stop the Autobots from escaping their dying homeworld. One moment you're <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11902\" href=\"/soundwave/3005-11902/\" slug=\"soundwave\">Soundwave</a>, leading a boarding party and ejecting tapes all over the unsuspecting Autobots. Then it quickly shifts focus to another character, and another, and another, each of which is playing a different role in this larger conflict. It creates a series of manic moments that feel incredibly cool and take advantage of the ensemble cast in some really great ways. It'd be hard to deal with a full game like this, since the pace would be impossible to keep up, but when you put it up against the slow, repetitive pace of the rest of the campaign, it puts the rest of the game to shame.</p><p style=\"\">Fall of Cybertron also has competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. The competitive action gives you <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">team deathmatch</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-25\" href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" slug=\"capture-the-flag\">CTF</a>, capture-and-hold, and a headhunter mode. It's also class-based, with different classes getting access to different weapons and abilities. Scientist-class robots have a heal beam, for example. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-39\" href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" slug=\"experience-points\">Experience</a> is earned on a per-class basis. A lot of the same control and mechanic problems from the campaign exist here, as well, but the competitive multiplayer also has the game's coolest feature. You can create your own Transformers.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/2189973-original5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2189973\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/2189973-original5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2189973\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28314/2189973-scale_medium5.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28314/2189973-scale_medium5.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The origin of the Dinobots has been rewritten in an interesting way that fits with the storyline.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Not from scratch, of course. The game has a pile of different arm, shoulder, head, chest, and other options to choose from, letting you customize your form. If you want to just create a specific Transformer, you can purchase a whole armor set. I, for example, just wanted to look like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15774\" href=\"/shockwave/3005-15774/\" slug=\"shockwave\">Shockwave</a>. The chest piece determines what your basic vehicle shape is, but the other parts make a mark, as well, letting you put specific wheels on your car forms or choose just the sort of wings you want for a jet form. It's a neat idea that looks pretty great.</p><p style=\"\">Escalation is Transformers: Fall of Cybertron's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\" href=\"/horde-mode/3015-3021/\" slug=\"horde-mode\">wave-based survival mode</a>. You'll face 15 waves of enemies and earn currency along the way that can be used to buy more ammo, pick up new weapons, and open up additional areas in the levels. Here, you'll play as specific four-bot crews, each with specific abilities like the heal beam, an object that regenerates ammo for players that stand within a specific radius, and so on. It's absolutely functional.</p><p style=\"\">Visually, the art and overall style shines through a lackluster frame rate. When the action heats up, everything chops up. Some of the in-engine cutscenes look pretty bad as a result, which robs some of the game's grander moments of their impact. But the game strikes the right balance between robots and vehicles that look appropriate in this <a data-ref-id=\"3035-939\" href=\"/cybertron/3035-939/\" slug=\"cybertron\">Cybertronian</a> environment and the G1 look and feel that most fans seem to want. Jazz and Cliffjumper look fantastic. Optimus Prime's robot form is pretty sharp. Shockwave, despite not having a voice that fits with the voice I expect to be coming out of his blinking... eye-thing, looks great. Even the vehicle forms look sharp, as long as you're prepared to handle the notion that Megatron is a hover tank instead of a big flying pistol. Cybertron is also depicted quite well, with plenty of scenery changes that, for a planet made entirely of metal, manage to give the campaign a good deal of visual variety. Again, it's just a shame that you have to see all this through a lens that can't keep up with the action. The PS3 version is saddled with an audio issue, causing some dialogue to get cut off or play slightly later than it should, making some of the in-mission conversations sound stilted and unnatural.</p><p style=\"\">The highs in Transformers: Fall of Cybertron are very high. The final chapter and the way it presents its world are awesome things to see if you care about the Transformers franchise. It rewrites origins in ways that feel elegant, especially when compared to things like the movie trilogy. And it has the right idea with character-specific abilities that help to make the individual Transformers feel different. But it doesn't go far enough in that direction to stand out, and it ultimately feels like it's being held back by its by-the-numbers shooting. There are some great ideas here, but you'll have to wade through a pretty thick set of drawbacks to enjoy them. With that in mind, it'll really help if you're the sort of person who <i>really</i> cares about the Transformers franchise.</p>", "deck": "Fall of Cybertron has some truly excellent moments, but you'll need to look past some serious downsides to enjoy the overall package.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-518/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36634/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/transformers-fall-of-cybertron/3030-36634/", "id": 36634, "name": "Transformers: Fall of Cybertron"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-08-21 10:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-116025/", "id": 116025, "name": "Transformers: Fall of Cybertron"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rock-band-blitz-review/1900-519/", "description": "<p style=\"\">It’s been a good two years since the tide broke fully on the trend of big plastic-instrument-driven rhythm games, a trend that developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-648\" href=\"/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/\" slug=\"harmonix-music-systems-inc\">Harmonix</a> capped capably with 2010’s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27919\" href=\"/rock-band-3/3030-27919/\" slug=\"rock-band-3\">Rock Band 3</a>. And while everyone seems to have had their fill of that expensive, living-room-cluttering karaoke experience, Harmonix is betting that folks still have an appetite for a lower-stakes form of rhythm game action with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-37879\" href=\"/rock-band-blitz/3030-37879/\" slug=\"rock-band-blitz\">Rock Band Blitz</a>. This is a single-player downloadable game that leverages the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">Rock Band</a> aesthetic--and, more importantly, the Rock Band DLC you may have already purchased--against gameplay that more closely recalls the Cambridge developer’s work with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-313\" href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" slug=\"sony-computer-entertainment-america\">Sony</a> on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5825\" href=\"/frequency/3030-5825/\" slug=\"frequency\">Frequency</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1420\" href=\"/amplitude/3030-1420/\" slug=\"amplitude\">Amplitude</a>, though without being an exact facsimile of either of those titles. It’s got some agreeably sticky social hooks that, still, could’ve been better implemented, and it’s a harder experience to recommend if you’ve not already made the monetary investment in Rock Band DLC--or, at least, spent the $5 to $10 a pop to export the songs from some of the several on-disc Rock Band games that support such a feature--but under the right circumstances, it’s a terrifically difficult game to put down.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2167247-rock_band_blitz_screenshots2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167247\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56270627062706\" data-width=\"606\" style=\"width: 606px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2167247-rock_band_blitz_screenshots2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167247\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2167247-rock_band_blitz_screenshots2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The road to Rock City is paved with notes.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The basic format will be immediately familiar to rhythm game players of most stripes, presenting you with a scrolling highway of note patterns, broken into discreet lanes for each instrument--<a data-ref-id=\"3055-1271\" href=\"/drums/3055-1271/\" slug=\"drums\">drums</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3810\" href=\"/bass/3015-3810/\" slug=\"bass\">bass</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-35\" href=\"/guitar/3055-35/\" slug=\"guitar\">guitar</a>, vocals, and, when the occasion is appropriate, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4151\" href=\"/musical-keyboard/3055-4151/\" slug=\"musical-keyboard\">keyboard</a>. Unlike the traditional Rock Band experience, Blitz is played with a controller, and allows you to switch from one instrument to another at will. And unlike other, similarly abstracted Rock Band experiences--like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25421\" href=\"/rock-band-unplugged/3030-25421/\" slug=\"rock-band-unplugged\">Rock Band Unplugged</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" slug=\"psp\">PSP</a>, or the simply titled Rock Band for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" slug=\"iphone\">iOS</a>--the note patterns for each instrument have been boiled down to just two notes. By default, you use the d-pad and the bottom face button (A on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">360</a>, X on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PS3</a>) to trigger left and right notes, respectively, with the shoulders shuttling you from one instrument to the next. It’s a setup that can initially feel a little awkward, specifically using the d-pad effectively like a button, and while there are a number of alternate control schemes to choose from, I eventually found the default to be the most comfortable. Perhaps more importantly, the game is still able to evoke the overall sense of playing these instruments, even if they’ve been abstracted all the way down to alternating button-presses on a gamepad.</p><p style=\"\">The basic simplicity, and familiarity, of the gameplay in Rock Band Blitz can be deceptive, because the layers of systems in place in Rock Band Blitz alter the way you approach the gameplay on a pretty fundamental level. Unlike Rock Band, instrument score multipliers aren’t based on a sustained string of perfect note hits, but rather, build up over the course of the entire song, increasing incrementally with each successful note hit. However, songs are divided into sections, and as you transition from one section to the next, the lowest instrument multiplier you’ve built up thus far will determine the maximum multiplier you can achieve with any instrument in the subsequent section. Since these multipliers can impact your score exponentionally--and make no mistake, though you’ll earn “stars” as your performance improves, your actual numerical score is the truer yardstick of success in Rock Band Blitz--your number one priority is to max out all of your instrument multipliers as efficiently as possible.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2167256-rock_band_blitz_screenshots11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167256\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56270627062706\" data-width=\"606\" style=\"width: 606px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2167256-rock_band_blitz_screenshots11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167256\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2167256-rock_band_blitz_screenshots11.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Tapping into your existing Rock Band library is a must.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But then, the importance of selecting the ideal combination of power-ups before going into a song cannot be overstated, either. When you first start, you won’t have access to any power-ups at all, a handicap that will, at least in most cases, prevent you from getting five stars on a song, let alone post a competitive score. As you play, though, you’ll earn two types of currency that are central to the power-up system. Blitz Cred is effectively your experience level, and earning more of it unlocks more power-ups to choose from. Your Blitz Cred number never goes down, unlike Coins, which you earn similarly, but which you have to spend in order to actually equip the power-ups before starting a song. Power-ups are divvied into three categories. One determines the effect of activating stored-up Overdrive--which can range from an additional, temporary multiplier bump to randomly clearing out swaths of notes in front of you--the second determines the effect of special purple trigger notes, and the third essentially lets you choose one instrument to receive an additional score bump for playing. Certain power-ups complement each other better than others, and it simply takes experimenting with different combinations to find which ones yield the best results.</p><p style=\"\">I haven’t even mentioned Blitz mode yet, which triggers automatically and creates an increased sense of speed on the note highway, along with an additional score bonus, when you go a stretch without making any mistakes, but it should be clear by now that there are kind of a lot of moving parts in Rock Band Blitz. It’s a surprising amount of systems layered on top of systems for a game that initially seems so simple, and frankly, the game doesn’t do a terrific job of explaining them all. Or rather, the tutorial just sort of piles them all on at once, and when you’re just starting, it’s difficult to parse out which bits will be truly significant. You’ll figure it out as you go along, but it can make the low scores you post early on a little confounding.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Rock Band Blitz comes with 25 licensed songs, covering the typically eclectic Rock Band spread, including everything from classic Elton John and Rick Springfield jams to modern earworms by Maroon 5 and Foster the People. The full soundtrack also functions as traditional Rock Band songs, so if you’re still an active Rock Band player, Blitz is an absolute no-brainer bargain, considering the going price of Rock Band DLC. If you <i>only</i> have those 25 songs, though, you’re simply not going to be getting the most out of Rock Band Blitz, as the real value here comes from the game’s capacity to tap into your (presumably) existing Rock Band library. It’s the savviest, most-clever part of Rock Band Blitz, providing a new lease on life for content that you’ve likely long since paid for and forgotten about, particularly for someone like me, who has already (shamefully) spent hundreds of dollars on DLC and disc exports.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2167255-rock_band_blitz_screenshots10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167255\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56270627062706\" data-width=\"606\" style=\"width: 606px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2167255-rock_band_blitz_screenshots10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167255\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2167255-rock_band_blitz_screenshots10.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2167255-rock_band_blitz_screenshots10.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Get your mittz on Blitz!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once you’ve played everything on the included soundtrack once or twice and unlocked all of the power-ups, there’s not much formalized structure in Rock Band Blitz, which gets its longer legs from pitting your scores against those on your friends lists, a feature that doesn’t really open up until you hook the game up to your Facebook account. From here, you can access Rock Band World on your PC and challenge your friends to a Score War--a song-specific multi-day high-score competition--or make progress on a variety of eclectic goals, all of which earn you those precious Coins you’ll need to continue using power-ups. If your friends are into it, the Score War stuff is terrific fun, it’s just a shame that it all can’t be deployed from within the game itself, requiring you to bounce back and forth between your PC and the game. While the ability to cross-pollinate your Xbox Live (or PlayStation Network) friends list with your Facebook friends list is kind of nifty, it’s a bad tradeoff.</p><p style=\"\">The clunky social integration and overabundance of games systems strata ultimately don’t negate the old-school rhythm game fun in Rock Band Blitz, and if you’re already invested in the Rock Band platform, it almost seems foolish <i>not</i> to spend the $15 to extend the life of your library.</p><p style=\"\"><i>EDITOR’S NOTE: For the sake of full disclosure, members of the Giant Bomb staff, the reviewer included, have personal relationships with members of the Harmonix community and public relations team.

There are new ideas here, great ones even. But those ideas don't translate especially well into this year's game, coming off as either half-baked, or simply not reasonable by modern console standards. This is a game that tries to do a lot of things with a lot of different modes, gameplay concepts, and engines, many of which haven't really seen any significant overhauls in years. As a result, Madden NFL 13 often feels more like a beta version of a much better game to come, than a fully fleshed-out title in its own right.</p><p style=\"\">Nowhere is this more apparent than in Madden's new physics system. EA has taken the Infinity Engine and stapled it onto Madden's collision detection, resulting in what should be a more natural-looking tackling system. Unfortunately, there's nothing natural-feeling about it. The one thing it does do well is that player models feature even less suction than before. Nobody looks magnetized to each other when they hit. Occasionally the ball still looks like it lands in a receiver's hand by way of divine intervention, but by and large everything looks like it's happening in real time.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, what happens in real time doesn't look especially good at all. Collisions often result in grotesque bending of limbs and spines that, perhaps in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4166\" href=\"/blitz-the-league/3030-4166/\" slug=\"blitz-the-league\">another football game</a>, might be accompanied by an x-ray closeup of bones snapping. Except that's clearly not <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1\" href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\" slug=\"electronic-arts\">EA's</a> intent here. Rather, it's the engine trying to make the player models move naturally based on where the hit is coming from. So you get guys basically being folded in half at the lower back, and then just gingerly popping back up, only to trip over another grounded teammate. That's another strange thing about the engine: it apparently doesn't understand the difference between mild stumbling and a straight-up pratfall. Every time a player trips or even just walks too close to another player on the ground, they stumble to the ground like they've been pushed over. I had three guys all do this at the same time during one especially peculiar kickoff. It's just bizarre.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Thankfully, this doesn't have any real impact on the field, save for a few minor hits occasionally resulting in overly strong reactions from ball carriers. However, whenever the game cuts to a replay, you get to see basically every single problem with the physics engine highlighted with long, luxurious looks at every robotic reaction animation. As guys fall to the ground in slow motion, they look like they're popping and locking the whole way down. It seems as though the physics engine can only react in very specific timing increments, resulting in these labored looking movements. Unrelated but similarly strange is the game's propensity toward massive, out-of-nowhere frame rate hitches. I don't mean slowdown, but literal freezing of the screen for a few seconds at a time. It's almost like in an online game, when lag requires the game to pause to resync, except this happened to me several times in offline games. I also got at least one crash on a loading screen, and this was with a retail copy.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109743/2266471-madden13cc12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2266471\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109743/2266471-madden13cc12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2266471\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/109743/2266471-madden13cc12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The new XP system for player/coach upgrades is a neat idea, but isn't implemented well.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Still, while the visual and physics engines are left wanting, the core gameplay is still pretty good. Blocking and interacting with blockers feels particularly good this year, as does the running game. Purportedly there are some new variations in the passing game when it comes to throwing directions and such, but even playing last year's game and this year's back to back, I could barely feel the difference. It's also worth noting that interceptions are especially prevalent this year, though that's not through a computer cheat. It's just easier to time interceptions as a defensive back now, so users who like playing the receivers will have an easier time picking off wayward passes. I wouldn't call it cheap, necessarily, but it certainly pays to be a bit more careful with your passes this year.</p><p style=\"\">The other major overhaul to Madden NFL 13 comes in its mode selection. Franchise, online franchise, and superstar modes have all been sandwiched into one ungainly career mode called connected careers. Here, you can choose to be a coach or a player, offline or on in a franchise of your design. Want to coach an offline squad the old fashioned way? That's still an option. But if you want to, say, create an all-Quarterbacks league online with your friends, that option's there too.</p><p style=\"\">It's a broadening of the experience that makes a lot of sense, but lacks a bit in the execution this year. Mostly, issues with the user interface tend to be the culprit. Franchise functionality especially becomes more cumbersome this year, due to free agent and scouting menus that aren't always as clear as they should be. For instance, the free agent menu allows for bids on players in the off-season, but there's no clearcut way to see what other teams have bid, nor how your bid ranks on the player's interest level. There is a small menu on a player screen that shows you a player's interest level, but it never seems to be right. I bid on four free agents, one of which had high interest, and three of which had very low interest. All of them accepted my contract offers, most of which were below their original asking price.</p><p style=\"\">The new XP system also seems kind of pointless. You can earn XP by reaching specific milestones each game, or by practicing with your team. However, the XP bonuses you gain are so minuscule that they border on worthless. Upgrading your players takes so long that most players will be gone from your squad, either in free agency or retirement, long before you have any meaningful impact on them.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame, because I like where these modes are headed. Creating an interconnected experience with the offline and online modes is a tremendous accomplishment in its own right, especially considering how woefully disconnected all this stuff has been in the past. The UI and mode designs just need to catch up with the technology next time around.</p><p style=\"\">The last element to see a significant overhaul is the on-field presentation. Inching ever closer to that \"real TV broadcast\" feel, CBS Sports personalities <a data-ref-id=\"3040-102385\" href=\"/jim-nantz/3040-102385/\" slug=\"jim-nantz\">Jim Nantz</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-75082\" href=\"/phil-simms/3040-75082/\" slug=\"phil-simms\">Phil Simms</a> replace last year's mostly miserable commentary tracks with more leisurely, more insightful commentary of their own distinct flavor. Mostly this stuff is fine, accurate even, considering Simms is just as dull in the game as he is in real life. Some lines repeat too often, and Nantz makes some inaccurate calls from time to time, but by and large, this is an improvement.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109743/2266470-madden13cc9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2266470\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/109743/2266470-madden13cc9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2266470\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/109743/2266470-madden13cc9.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/109743/2266470-madden13cc9.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Remember when Madden was actually in Madden? Those were the days.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">ESPN has also gotten in on the act via the connected careers mode. ESPN anchor <a data-ref-id=\"3040-102397\" href=\"/trey-wingo/3040-102397/\" slug=\"trey-wingo\">Trey Wingo</a> narrates an introduction video that (poorly) explains the new features in this year's game, and does much of the talking during the new live draft. This is the one aspect of the franchise that really improved this year, with a much more TV broadcast inspired presentation that is pretty easy to work with on the UI front. Wingo is perhaps a bit overly wordy when describing prospects, often leading to a lot of bleed-over dialogue as you skip through picks, but generally his presence is welcome. Hell, even the fake Twitter accounts for the likes of Mark Schlereth and Skip Bayless is kinda neat, though EA probably ought to license a few mainstay accounts like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robdelaney\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rob Delaney</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">horse_ebooks</a> next year, just for authenticity's sake.</p><p style=\"\">Tragically, EA has taken this push toward TV-style broadcasting to also include some of the most egregious in-game advertising seen in ages. EA Sports titles in particular have always been EA's go-to division for funneling ad content, since we see ads in sports all the time, so it's fine! Right? No, not right. While the need for alternate revenue sources is understandable, having Jim Nantz insert three Papa John's pizza mentions in a single game is just outright shitty. Have as many stadium billboard ads as you want, but dear god, if I have to see the email address for the Official NFL Pizza Sponsor plastered on my screen one more time, I'm throwing this disc out the window.</p><p style=\"\">All of this considered, there is enough here for die-hard football fans to enjoy. In spite of its misfires and glitches, Madden NFL 13 is a step forward for this franchise. It's a small, clumsy step, but considering how little forward progress this series has made in recent years, any kind of step is a cause for minor celebration. If you can forgive the technical problems and often cumbersome menus, there's a football game worth liking here.</p>", "deck": "The ideas behind Madden NFL 13 are great ones.

That's the emerging pattern for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\" href=\"/namco/3010-7420/\" slug=\"namco\">Namco</a>'s long-running <a data-ref-id=\"3025-333\" href=\"/tekken/3025-333/\" slug=\"tekken\">Tekken</a> franchise. So, with 2009's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23833\" href=\"/tekken-6-bloodline-rebellion/3030-23833/\" slug=\"tekken-6-bloodline-rebellion\">Tekken 6</a> long in our rearview and the franchise overall feeling a bit repetitive nowadays, it's nice to get something to mix it up even a little bit. And the two-man moves found in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32716\" href=\"/tekken-tag-tournament-2/3030-32716/\" slug=\"tekken-tag-tournament-2\">Tekken Tag Tournament 2</a> offer an interesting change of pace that will probably confound a lot of beginning players at first, but the game's helpful tutorial is effective at getting any persistent player up to speed and ready to take two fighters into combat.</p><p style=\"\">TTT2 is fairly no-nonsense about how it handles its business. It has its mode bases covered with an arcade mode, training, and so on. Ghost battle, which has you competing against teams of varying degrees of skill as you rank up your characters and earn fight money to spend on costume parts also returns, though every mode is fought against named \"ghosts.\" This leads to some ridiculous moments in the arcade mode, though, since even the final boss confrontation might be a customized version of the character, covered in a motorcycle helmet or some other piece of gear that sort of lessens the impact of the final fight. The mode that breaks out of the standard Tekken mold has you upgrading a robot named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3527\" href=\"/combot/3005-3527/\" slug=\"combot\">Combot</a> by taking it through numerous challenges that serve as tutorials for the game's systems, from basic movement up through strikes, how to punish after a block, some basic juggle concepts, and the handful of new tag-oriented mechanics. It's not going to make you the world's greatest Tekken player, but it'll at least give you the tools you need to proceed.</p><p style=\"\">As with the previous Tag game, Tag 2 takes place outside of the normal continuum of Tekken's bear-punching, dinosaur-fighting, volcano-tossing storyline and offers a roster that contains just about every fighter that's ever appeared in a Tekken game. That's over 50 characters, in case you haven't been keeping track, and there are a few more on the way either as pre-order bonuses or free post-release downloads. Thankfully <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2463\" href=\"/gon/3005-2463/\" slug=\"gon\">Gon</a> is nowhere to be found.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2192134-006019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192134\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2192134-006019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192134\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2192134-006019.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can outfit Combot with a set of moves in the Combot Tuning menu.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's locked behind an online pass, but the online play works just fine. If you get matched up with a player with full connection bars, it feels great. It also offers a handful of good player matching options to keep you from getting into a fight with someone way out of your league. This is sort of vital, because it's hard to think of a fighting game that is less fun than Tekken when it comes to just getting your ass handed to you. Plenty of other fighting games make losing a learning experience. And, sure, if I paid extra-close attention, I'd eventually learn all the mix-ups and match-ups across the Tekken roster. But until that day, each mistake results in huge chunks of my life bar being taken away as I spend most of the fight helplessly floating around as I bounce off of some guy's fists. There's usually no escape from that situation, you're just sort of left to take it and hope that you can roll out of the way or rise fast enough to start blocking so you can set up a tag to your other (hopefully healthier) character.</p><p style=\"\">If you're the sort of person that thrives on that sort of Tekken action, well great... actually, if you're that sort of person, you probably already bought Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and don't really need a review to tell you anything about the game. But I digress. For most people, you're going to want to make sure that you can find players that match your skill (or lack thereof) at the game. That's true of any competitive game, of course, but I'd underline it twice when it comes to Tekken. Losing at Tekken can be the sort of frustrating that makes you want to turn off your console and go outside for a change.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">None of that really reflects one way or the other on the overall quality of the game, though. It's a nice-looking fighter, with big characters that animate well, even if a lot of that animation has been around the series for years. It has plenty of depth, so if you're the type that actually wants to start learning the game at a higher level, it has plenty of levels for you to aspire to, but you'll need to hit up a pile of websites and start learning Tekken theory there, because the game doesn't really go beyond showing you the basic moves and combo timing. That's more than most fighting games, of course, but don't expect miracles. You will need to put in work to get great.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35324/2254661-yeah.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2254661\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35324/2254661-yeah.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2254661\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35324/2254661-yeah.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35324/2254661-yeah.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>These ladies are SHOCKED by the overall quality of the online play.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If dressing your fighters up sounds appealing, the game has a decent customize mode that lets you buy and color different pieces for each of your fighters. You can save multiple costumes per character, so if you're trying to make matching tag partners, it's totally doable. The mode could have saved some steps, though, by allowing you to buy and immediately equip new gear. Instead you have to go to the buy section, pick out your items, <i>then</i> go over to equip to put it all on. That seems like a weird way to handle it.</p><p style=\"\">Though the arcade version has smoother-looking character models, the console version still looks good, overall. The differences between the platforms is something of a toss-up, with the PS3 version taking slightly longer to load your custom costumes up at select time and the 360 version doing that astoundingly annoying thing where it seizes up for a few seconds every time you unlock an achievement. Once you've blasted the easy <a data-ref-id=\"3015-29\" href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" slug=\"achievements\">achievements</a> out of the way, that issue goes away, but it's still pretty lame that little things like that haven't been dealt with prior to release.</p><p style=\"\">Tekken's tag moves help freshen up the fighting and make TTT2 stand apart from the last couple of Tekken releases, and it's a solid reminder that Namco is still capable of making vibrant, exciting fighters. But it's only truly great if you're playing against like-minded, similarly skilled opposition. If you can rustle up a community of people that fit that bill, go nuts, it's a great time. But if you're a Tekken neophyte hoping to pick it up along the way, you'll probably be brutally rebuffed by what you find.</p>", "deck": "Tekken Tag Tournament 2 works great online and offers enough variety to make it stand out from other recent Tekken efforts.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-521/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32716/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tekken-tag-tournament-2/3030-32716/", "id": 32716, "name": "Tekken Tag Tournament 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-09-11 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-116248/", "id": 116248, "name": "Tekken Tag Tournament 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/nhl-13-review/1900-522/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-37807\" href=\"/nhl-13/3030-37807/\" slug=\"nhl-13\">NHL 13</a> is a tale of two games.

It pushes the series into a more realistic setting, where on-ice physics exist and size and speed matter a hell of a lot more than ever before. Off the ice, however, problems begin to emerge. Lingering issues that plagued areas like the franchise and online modes have reared their ugly head yet again, and new additions, like the GM Connected mode, are frankly kind of a mess.

Largely, this is due to the new \"total control skating\" feature, which is essentially a buzzword for physics. Yes, the NHL series has certainly had physics before, but one thing that never really felt right was in the speed of players, versus their movements on the ice. In reality, a speedy skater going full bore down the ice would make it quite difficult for him to make a strong cut on the ice. In the game previously, you could basically just floor it down the ice and make wraparounds and directional changes with only minimal effort. This year, that's not the case.</p><p style=\"\">When you dart toward the goal, your momentum will carry you forward. Tight turns are more difficult for less agile players, and stopping and reversing direction requires a more pronounced stop and start that's true to real skating. The speeds of individual players register much more realistically now, too. A speedy sniper going up against a lumbering defenseman now gives you a legit opportunity to skate by him for a potential scoring chance. By the same token, those lumbering d-men are harder to knock around and push past now.</p><p style=\"\">What this leads to is a game that requires more accurate and thoughtful positioning when attempting to score. Passing can still be kind of a pain in the ass, but once you get accustomed to the quirks of the puck physics, setting up plays in the offensive zone simply works much better than in previous years.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That's especially important due to the new goalie animations installed this year. Every couple of years, EA proclaims that goalies are better, and half the time that actually appears true. This is one of those times. Though it's subtle, the addition of free limb movement for goalies has made certain saves, and certain vulnerabilities, appear in more realistic fashion. You'll still see some weird, bouncy goals that seem more the result of wonky physics than actual skill, but by and large, \"money goals\" appear to be absent this year.</p><p style=\"\">With all these things combined, the simple act of getting on the ice and playing 60 (more like 20) minutes of hockey is fun again and again. Unfortunately, the rest of the package that surrounds that admittedly primary act of the game is less laudable.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78531/2296962-nhl13.02.lg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2296962\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56179775280899\" data-width=\"979\" style=\"width: 979px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78531/2296962-nhl13.02.lg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2296962\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/78531/2296962-nhl13.02.lg.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Goalies are much more adept at making crazy saves, which works both for and against you.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Of course the old standbys like the Be a GM and Be a Player modes are on-hand, and basically as they've been for the last few years. The GM mode's primary tweaks come from the computer AI. EA evidently went to great lengths to try and make your opposing GMs more shrewd in dealing with the player, and indeed, you will find it exceedingly difficult to put one over on another GM, as they're stingy with their players and picks. In fact, they're so stingy that trading becomes something close to useless in many situations. Trading blocks are meant to be more transparent this year, but AI GMs seemingly only abide by them arbitrarily. Whether it's a ludicrous concern over salary cap (even if the team has ample free cash), or a GM flat-out rejecting a trade for a player that fits their <i>exact</i> needs for something of equal value, trading has never felt more scattered in its usefulness.</p><p style=\"\">Outside of that quirk, the GM mode is just fine offline. Online is where it runs into more trouble. Taking a cue from Madden's Connected Careers mode, NHL 13 features a GM Connected mode that lets up to 750 people--yes, really--participate in a single league as a player or GM. If any active league actually reaches that 750 number and finishes a proper season with all games played, I'll eat a shoe, Herzog style. That said, if even a fraction of that number of people could get together under those circumstances and play a fun, easy-to-use online league setting, that would be amazing. Sadly, easy-to-use is the last thing this mode deserves to be called.</p><p style=\"\">The core conceit is good, and the mode basically works as advertised, but navigating the menu system set up for it simply isn't worth the effort. It's nowhere near as streamlined as the in-game player and GM modes, and it's frankly a nightmare to sift through. Things are rarely where they seem like they ought to be, and by the time you do learn the ins and outs of this cursed thing, you'll <i>still</i> have to contend with the endless load times. I have no idea what it is that GM Connected requires constant, unfettered online access to, but its regular need to sync up with online servers means simply moving between screens can take between five and ten seconds, if not longer in some cases.</p><p style=\"\">There's a chance that these online issues may improve over time, but they're not the only online issue that needs addressing. Online play in general has kind of a laggy feel to it, which is exacerbated by the new physics system. Before, if you ran into lag you'd mostly just have to contend with adjusting the timing of your shot, but now you have to adjust for the timing of <i>everything</i>. Simply moving toward the net can feel completely different from the offline experience, and requires a great deal more thinking ahead. In the rare game I managed to play that was basically lag free, it felt better, if not perfect. But when the lag hits, it can get pretty ugly.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78531/2296965-nhl13_car_semin_wm_resize.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2296965\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56190476190476\" data-width=\"630\" style=\"width: 630px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78531/2296965-nhl13_car_semin_wm_resize.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2296965\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/78531/2296965-nhl13_car_semin_wm_resize.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/78531/2296965-nhl13_car_semin_wm_resize.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Trying to set up offensive plays in laggy online matches is, unsurprisingly, not especially fun.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Other modes, like the NHL Moments Live and Hockey Ultimate Team features, are well-meaning, if not altogether exciting additions. Ultimate Team functions similarly to Madden, with its card collecting and microtransaction-focused feature set, though in an odd twist, card packs earned and/or purchased are strangely lean on actual player cards. Nearly all the packs I picked up skewed largely toward consumable cards, used to temporarily upgrade players' stats. The NHL Moments feature is similar to its <a data-ref-id=\"3030-37754\" href=\"/madden-nfl-13/3030-37754/\" slug=\"madden-nfl-13\">Madden</a> counterpart, with the one important tweak of allowing you to earn Ultimate Team currency by completing its challenges. The NHL Legends feature is back as well, though it once again only houses a small number of legendary players, and doesn't feature any of those players' supporting casts. I like playing as <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89667\" href=\"/wayne-gretzky/3040-89667/\" slug=\"wayne-gretzky\">Wayne Gretzky</a>, but it's pretty weak that none of his most famous teams are playable.</p><p style=\"\">Thus is the dilemma of NHL 13. It is a game that plays extremely well, yet offers little beyond the expected in terms of supplementary entertainment. Offline, GM mode is about as much fun as you'd generally want it to be, and the Ultimate Team stuff can be amusing in stretches, but the remaining features are mostly minor distractions at best, and outright arduous to use at worst. Still, no matter how many ancillary modes fail to live up to expectations, nothing trumps the core gameplay in terms of overall importance, and NHL 13's is too good to dismiss. This is a game you'll want to come back to play again and again, offline and online (provided the servers get fixed). The variety might not be there, but the gameplay most certainly is.</p>", "deck": "On the ice, NHL 13 is the strongest sequel in the series to date. Off it?

By that standard, it's certainly a better game than the original, and it backs these additions up with smart online updates, an even more expansive random loot generator, and a revamped set of character classes that make every piece of gear and every skill point you spend feel like a tough trade-off between different types of character growth. It feels very iterative in spots, and it often feels like you can see the parts where <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\" href=\"/gearbox-software-llc/3010-1615/\" slug=\"gearbox-software-llc\">Gearbox</a> ripped out an old system and swapped it for a more robust and balanced replacement. It also maintains its strong sense of humor, but the various characters in play throughout Borderlands 2 can be a little hit-and-miss, leading to cases where I just wanted the game to shut up and let me get back to shooting stuff and opening chests.</p><p style=\"\">Borderlands 2 is set five years after the events of the first game and features an all-new cast of playable characters, who are again cast as \"vault hunters\" en route to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-156\" href=\"/pandora/3035-156/\" slug=\"pandora\">Pandora</a> to make a fortune. The cast of the first game now exist as full-on characters in the world, complete with dialogue that helps flesh them out as actual people, rather than mostly silent player characters. Most of your missions will come from Roland and the gang, though since they were <i>barely</i> characters in the first game, I never really got attached to any of them. The original gang serves as leaders of a resistance movement that's attempting to fight against the Hyperion Corporation, led by a smarmy prick named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-20526\" href=\"/handsome-jack/3005-20526/\" slug=\"handsome-jack\">Handsome Jack</a>. It seems that Jack swooped in after the events of the first game, took credit for the vault hunters' actions, and is now attempting to mine the heck out of the planet because it's crawling in priceless alien ore that, naturally, is one of the keys to awakening some ancient alien power. You, as one of the new vault hunters that's been screwed over by Handsome Jack and left for dead, quickly team up with the old crew to do their bidding, seek revenge, and collect a whole lot of loot along the way.</p><p style=\"\">Though the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\" href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/\" slug=\"borderlands\">Borderlands</a> certainly had more than its fair share of loot variety, the sequel really blows this aspect of the game out by bringing more and flashier effects to weapons as well as shields, class mods, grenade types, and relics. You'll find large capacity shields that lower your health, or shields that give you a deep bonus to melee damage when they're depleted, or shields that reflect damage onto melee attackers with an elemental bonus. <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">Grenades</a> can have elemental effects as well, along with statistics such as fuse time, radius, and overall damage. But the grenades can still be bouncing betties, transfusion grenades that leech health from your targets, and other types that appeared in the first game. Class mods and relics spread out quite a bit, too, giving you items that give you more experience points for kills, larger magazine size for weapons, or even bonuses that only work when you're firing guns from a specific manufacturer.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2265314\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2265314\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2265314-bl2_7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Though some of the characters may seem similar, the skill trees are different enough to make them all feel unique.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Gun manufacturers are one of the ways that Borderlands 2 gives method to its madness, and each weapon manufacturer specializes in a different style of weapon. Hyperion guns, for example, gain accuracy when you hold the fire button down, so instead of getting wild and all over the place like you'd expect, you actually get deadlier in longer bursts. That's weird. Jakobs tends to deal in revolvers and other Western-themed guns that have your character fanning the hammer as he or she squeezes off rounds as quickly as you can pull the trigger on your controller. Maliwan deals in weapons with elemental effects. Bandit weapons all have misspelled names and tend to have larger magazine sizes than the others. You get the idea. On top of that, it's sort of easy to get a sense for a weapon's basic style by just looking at it. Assault rifles with huge, open-ended barrels probably fire tiny rockets instead of bullets, for example. It'd be nice if there was an easy way to see a weapon actually firing without going through the process of actually equipping it, but after a dozen or so hours, you start to get a sense for which weapons fit with your play style and which weapons are just vendor trash.</p><p style=\"\">I don't know how you played the original Borderlands, but at some point, my Soldier character became practically unstoppable. With the ability to regenerate ammo and health, he became almost completely self-sufficient, and armed with the proper combat rifle, it was trivial to pick him back up if he ever managed to fall. Borderlands 2's skills feel a bit more balanced, making it more difficult to simultaneously spec in every direction. And the classes that appear analogous to classes from the first game aren't, so even if you think you know how the guy who tosses out a turret will play, the Commando feels very different from the Soldier. Even though you can easily respec your character at any time, I found myself agonizing over every skill decision because none of them were perfect fits for every situation. The loot, also, forces those decisions. Equipping a shield with a high capacity but also a penalty to your health might sound like a great idea... until you encounter a crew armed with shield-draining shock weapons. The only constant is that corrosive weapons, which chew through armored targets quite well, seem way more useful here than they were in the first game, because most of the villain's forces are armored robots.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Though questing in the direction of Handsome Jack is the entirety of the main line in Borderlands 2, there are plenty of side missions to find along the way. These are the missions that take you in wild different directions as you attempt to help find a new name for one of Pandora's creatures, help out a robot that wants to be human, or decide whether you want to return lewd photos of Moxxi to Marcus or back to Moxxi herself. In this case, the periphery of the experience is more interesting and fun than its core. The main quest pits you against Handsome Jack, who comes across as a one-note villain with very little to offer beyond a thick layer of smarm that gets old after the first few hours. I kept expecting some sort of meaningful progression for the villain, but the end result is a flat character that's more annoying than anything else. It was more of a \"I wish I could disable this character's dialogue\" feeling than a \"boy, I can't wait to shut this jerk up with my guns\" situation. In contrast, the rest of the game is lush with great little touches in its dialogue. Some of the best writing in the entire game, in fact, comes when you take a little too long to take action, be it holding for a moment before freeing <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4591\" href=\"/claptrap/3015-4591/\" slug=\"claptrap\">Claptrap</a> from the snow to waiting for the Guardian Angel to get impatient before you insert Quest Object A into Mission Advancement Slot B. These little gags are often worth waiting for, and even though they're usually only a couple of lines, they're some of the funniest moments in a game that, with a glaring exception or two, is generally pretty funny to begin with.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2135295-zero2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2135295\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.60569105691057\" data-width=\"738\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2135295-zero2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2135295\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2135295-zero2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2135295-zero2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zero's decoy ability makes him way more than just a simple sniper.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But the story and characters aren't everything. Playing with other people is what Borderlands does best, and that aspect of the game has grown up quite a bit. At any time you can pause your game and bring up a network menu to make your session publicly accessible, friends only, invite only, LAN, or totally offline. You can do this on the fly, without having to quit out or anything like that. It's really nice. Once players are in your game, you can open up the all-new trade interface to pass items around without having to drop them on the ground and expose yourself to potential thievery. In general, playing with other people is pretty much painless, even on PC, which now uses Steamworks across the board instead of that GameSpy nonsense. The PC version of the game is much friendlier overall, and the in-game menus for inventory are easily manipulated with a mouse. Playing the game with a mouse and keyboard feels just fine, but you can still play the PC version with a controller just as easily. Over on consoles, you'll still get a good sense of the game's terrific art, but the frame rates get quite dodgy when then action picks up and there's still scads of texture pop-in whenever you change zones. The PS3 version of the game, sort of like its predecessor, looks a little grimy and jaggy when compared to the 360 version, but it's certainly not a crippling issue.</p><p style=\"\">I obsessed over the original Borderlands in spite of its flaws. Earning loot and exploring every little corner of the world became top priority for me when that game was released, and I kept up with its DLC add-ons, doing my best to ignore their decidedly uneven quality. Borderlands 2 is a better game in most of the ways that matter, but some of that is brought down by the familiarity of the experience. Perhaps some of that is on me and spending a couple hundred hours with the first game has rendered me resilient to some of the new game's charms, but as someone who went into Borderlands 2 with a sickness that I thought only more Borderlands could cure, I'm left feeling like I didn't receive a full dose this time around.</p>", "deck": "Borderlands 2 gives you more Borderlands.

It does exactly what a stealth game should do, giving you a wide variety of tools and abilities with which to conduct your stealthy business, and gracing you with the absolute mobility to actually use them. Too many stealth games depend on rote memorization of enemy patterns and more or less go to shit every time you trigger an alarm, but this one, by contrast, empowers you to toy with the enemies like a stealth god, and still ably disappear unscathed back into the shadows even when the lights come up. You know that feeling in a stealth game when everything feels like it goes just your way, and you clear a whole room of witless guards without so much as a sound? I haven't gotten that feeling since <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-asylum\">Arkham Asylum</a>, but Mark of the Ninja has it. That's the highest praise I can think to give this game.</p><p style=\"\">The designers at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6227\" href=\"/klei-entertainment-inc/3010-6227/\" slug=\"klei-entertainment-inc\">Klei</a> made things easier on themselves by smooshing Mark of the Ninja's action down to two dimensions, which naturally gives you less spatial data to process than a 3D scene and consequently helps you maintain a more confident feeling of control over everything around you. For instance, it's a lot easier to predict enemies' line of sight when they can only be facing one of two directions. But it goes beyond that. As a bonafide ninja, your mastery of the environment is total; you can climb up walls and across ceilings, duck into ventilation ducts, dart between cover, and grapple all over the place faster than guards can possibly keep up with you. The game simply wouldn't work if you weren't so incredibly nimble, and it's that basic control and mobility that makes this game as fun as it is. It also helps that you can pause time whenever you want, to quickly queue up multiple abilities which then play out as soon as you resume the game.</p><p style=\"\">The design of the game is eminently impressive at every layer. On top of the core movement, you've got a wide array of abilities that let you focus on very different styles of play. You've got a category of distraction items like a noisemaker and chemical flare that are useful for getting enemies right where you want them. Then there's an attack category that includes stuff like spike traps and ravenous, flesh-eating insects, in case you'd rather just murder everyone directly with your tools. Or you can just rely solely on your trusty sword, since there's a whole list of stealth kills that let you take out guys while behind them, while in cover, while on the other side of a door from them, while hanging above their heads... This focus on multiple play styles reaches its peak with a series of unlockable ninja outfits that dramatically improve your abilities in one area (say, letting you carry two distraction items at once instead of one, or speeding up the process of stealth kills) while hampering you in another area (for instance, preventing you from restocking your items mid-level, or taking away your sword entirely). So if you want to go all the way in one direction, you can.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227094-007114.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227094\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227094-007114.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227094\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227094-007114.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dogs are actually the biggest jerks in this whole game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game even rewards you if you want to do none of this, since the single biggest bonus you can get at the end of every level comes from not killing a single enemy. There's an exceptionally elegant three-way objective system in place, with three types of objectives and three of each type per level (for a total of nine). Three of these are simple haiku scrolls hidden in the level, which dole out little bits of story as you go. Another three are level-specific objectives that push your stealth abilities. And the last three are tiered score objectives, the first (and probably second) of which you'll get as a matter of course. Getting the high score objective on each level requires you to really use your abilities to the utmost, though, and since you get points for practically every positive interaction with a guard--distracting them, terrorizing them, slipping by them unnoticed, hiding them after they're dead--you're encouraged to tackle each scenario as thoroughly and elegantly as you can for maximum score. I was immensely gratified when I started nailing all nine objectives (which result in more upgrade points on the skill tree) in each level about halfway through, but the game isn't shy about ramping up the difficulty in meaningful ways. You'll still be running into crazier types of obstacles and more well-equipped enemies all the way up to the last couple of levels of the game.</p><p style=\"\">Klei sort of established itself as the fluid hand-drawn 2D art studio with the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2154\" href=\"/shank/3025-2154/\" slug=\"shank\">Shank</a> games, and while those games looked great and moved with style, the depth of gameplay wasn't really there to keep them totally interesting all the way through. Mark of the Ninja makes good on that potential for marrying beautiful art and engaging design, with in-game action and hand-animated cutscenes every bit as good as the Shank stuff. But this game could use stick figures on blank backgrounds and it'd still be a ton of fun to play. It's so rewarding that, time permitting, I'd love to go back and get every objective on every level, and also finish its new-game-plus mode; in other words, I'd love to do everything there is to do here. I can't say that about many games. Mark of the Ninja executes its formula to such a high degree of near-perfection that I could hardly think of a way it could be meaningfully improved the whole way through it.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p>", "deck": "Mark of the Ninja is one of the most playable, rewarding, and downright fun stealth games ever made.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-525/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-37615/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mark-of-the-ninja/3030-37615/", "id": 37615, "name": "Mark of the Ninja"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-09-21 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-119048/", "id": 119048, "name": "Mark of the Ninja"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fire-pro-wrestling-review/1900-526/", "description": "<p style=\"\">I don't know that I've ever willingly spent more time playing an unquestionably bad game than I have with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32715\" href=\"/fire-pro-wrestling/3030-32715/\" slug=\"fire-pro-wrestling\">Fire Pro Wrestling</a> for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">Xbox Live Arcade</a>.

The timing-based grappling engine is replaced with a system that seems to have <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11394\" href=\"/wwf-no-mercy/3030-11394/\" slug=\"wwf-no-mercy\">WWF No Mercy</a> fans at least somewhat in mind, what with its weak and strong grappling system, and taunt-oriented finishers. Except that whatever sense of speed and timing you might expect from, well, any modern day wrestling game is completely absent. Characters dully lumber around the ring, swiping and grabbing for one another. Strong grapples are largely useless against any opponent who knows what they're doing, since they take so long to wind up. The same goes for charge moves, which you can only pull off when your opponent is pretty much completely dead. That means that you'll often just keep wandering up to people, grappling them, doing one of two, maybe three moves, and repeat until finisher.</p><p style=\"\">And yet I kept playing. Not just because I was reviewing it, but for hours longer than I needed to. For as stump-dumb as the gameplay is, there's something inexplicably likable about Fire Pro Wrestling. It probably has a lot to do with the sheer volume of upgradeable moves and stats you have at your disposal. As you play, you'll earn experience points you can use to boost your wrestler up in a bunch of different ways. You'll also unlock new moves, many of which recall the sort of zany, over-the-top cartoon nonsense of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-707\" href=\"/syn-sophia/3010-707/\" slug=\"syn-sophia\">AKI's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21526\" href=\"/ultimate-muscle-legends-vs-new-generation/3030-21526/\" slug=\"ultimate-muscle-legends-vs-new-generation\">Ultimate M.U.S.C.L.E.</a>, albeit with far less interesting characters.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">When you have other players around to play against, it's especially good, since the sometimes cheap, yet always clueless AI players tend to get old sometime around the moment you hit level 25. Unfortunately, those people are going to need to be in the room with you. The online mode in Fire Pro is just this side of busted. Lag was prevalent throughout every match I played, and in the most heinous circumstances, control input would drop down to nearly a full second of delay behind my button presses. At that point, you're just mashing buttons and hoping something connects.</p><p style=\"\">For these reasons, it's difficult to recommend Fire Pro Wrestling to just about anyone. I enjoyed it in spurts, but there's just too much wrong here to hold your attention for long. As amusing as it can be, it's really just a janky wrestling game with avatars stapled on for maximum stupidity. This is a game that either needed to be way simpler, or way more complicated, because the middle ground stinks.</p>", "deck": "Fire Pro Wrestling for XBLA is an inexplicable, almost likable fiasco.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-526/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32715/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fire-pro-wrestling/3030-32715/", "id": 32715, "name": "Fire Pro Wrestling"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2012-09-26 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-119745/", "id": 119745, "name": "Fire Pro Wrestling"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tokyo-jungle-review/1900-527/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2336337-tokyo3.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336337\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2336337-tokyo3.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336337\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2336337-tokyo3.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>Animals have challenges in varying spots, ensuring you'll see the whole, surprisingly big map.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/tokyo-jungle/3030-32532/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32532\">Tokyo Jungle</a> is so much more than a “wacky game from <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a>.” It would be easy to enjoy Tokyo Jungle ironically, but the reason I’ve sunk more than 15 hours into a dog-on-cat-on-dinosaur-on-hippo world where humanity no longer exists is because Tokyo Jungle also happens to be a good game.</p><p style=\"\">Though traditional <a href=\"/roguelike/3015-1065/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1065\">roguelike</a> fans may bristle at the comparison, it’s the easiest shorthand to explain the game’s central gameplay loop, the survival mode. Players are dropped in, and do as the mode suggests: stay alive. Besides just living longer, there are various challenges to keep you motivated, from consuming a set amount of calories to taking over a location by marking various spots. These sessions last anywhere from 15-to-30 minutes, since the game will inevitably spawn a supremely powerful beast into the world, who will totally wreck you. Plus, since the challenges aren't that varied, I often found myself playing only as far as unlocking the next animal before purposely dying. You can, however, save instead of mating and come back if you're having a good run.</p><p style=\"\">Unlocking the animals is the real hook here, since so many of ‘em play differently. An enormous list of animals greets you at the start, though most are locked away, requiring completion of animal-specific challenges. The animals are divided into two types--herbivore, carnivore--and require two different playstyles for success. Carnivores are stronger, combat-reliant animals, and you’ll need to become intimately familiar with the elegant counterattack system to survive. Herbivores want to avoid combat all costs, and must use their double jump ability to reach out-of-place environmental structures to slink around. The differing styles helps keep the gameplay fresh, a feeling compounded by random events that trigger each time you play. Sometimes a location will become poisoned, sometimes food will disappear, sometimes rain will obscure your vision, and sometimes all of those will happen at once, and turn a great run into an utter disaster. You’re balancing these random elements against other competing factors, including the 15-year lifespan of your animal, which forces you to mate and produce offspring, and having to constantly eat to avoid starving.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2336336-tokyo2.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336336\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.52627450980392\" data-width=\"1275\" style=\"width: 1275px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2336336-tokyo2.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336336\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2336336-tokyo2.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>Can't blame these felines for wanting to protect themselves.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One advantage you <i>do</i> have is loot. Yeah, <a href=\"/loot-gathering/3015-161/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-161\">loot</a>. Boxes will randomly appear in the world with items helpful for the moment (flea shampoo to remove fleas, which slow you down, or pet medicine to restore your life), and gear to boost various stats (my favorite is the hip-hop shirt that improves attack) or provide unique benefits (a headlamp to see further in the dark). The name, look, and description of items are hysterical, but the big problem is that loot doesn’t show up nearly enough. I’d sometimes go two or three runs without a new piece of gear, and there’s a <i>ton</i> of gear in this game, according to the in-game store. And since most of my time in Tokyo Jungle was simply spent playing just long enough to unlock the next animal, the gear didn’t really provide much of an advantage. Players looking to survive for 50 or 75 years, a requirement for some of the harder trophies, will probably get much more out of it.</p><p style=\"\">There is also a story mode in Tokyo Jungle, and it’s where the game gets even weirder, if you can believe it. Collecting three story drops in the survival mode will unlock diary entries that help explain what happened to mankind. The story mode begins as a series of short tales about the various animal factions interacting with one another, while eventually coughing up a direct explanation for Tokyo Jungle’s whole premise. By the end of the story, you will have a pretty cool, totally insane narrative justification for why there are <a href=\"/dinosaurs/3015-711/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-711\">dinosaurs</a> running around Shinjuku. That Tokyo Jungle even has an explanation for itself is impressive enough, and for it to make enough sense to go “oh, yeah, sure” is even better. It’s too bad the rad creatures that unlock as a consequence of finishing the story are so damn expensive, and there’s no way to earn enough points to unlock them without seriously grinding.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">I also take issue with the game locking some of its animals, like the <a href=\"/sabre-toothed-cats/3015-5517/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5517\">sabertooth</a> and <a href=\"/alligators/3015-3102/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3102\">alligator</a>, as downloadable content on <a href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-88\">PlayStation Network</a>. It’s one thing if Sony wants players to purchase crazy, one-off creatures as additional purchases, but part of the Tokyo Jungle addiction is coming across something crazy on a run, and knowing you’ll eventually be able to patrol the streets as that bad ass. Granted, Tokyo Jungle was a retail product in Japan and it’s just $15 over here as a download, but it’s still poor form, and there are better ways of teasing the player to pay a little more. That said, there are <i>plenty</i> of animals for you to unlock, and 15 hours later, I still don't have access to the dinosaurs.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2336335-tokyo1.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336335\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2336335-tokyo1.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336335\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2336335-tokyo1.jpeg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2336335-tokyo1.jpeg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A touching moment in the story mode, a bond across clans.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There are so many other little details that make Tokyo Jungle such a humorous, surprising delight, too. When a set of animals are about to mate, the game fades to black...and the controller rumbles. When you play as a baby chick, there’s no way to mate, because you need to fall asleep...and wake up as a chicken. When the Tosa clan has been battered, beaten, and removed from their home, only to be saved by a compassionate bear who...talks to you. Talks!

Then again, the game tries to be so many things to so many different people, the image of a many-headed hydra thrashing violently beyond the control of its developers comes readily to mind. There are a few fleeting moments of greatness in Resident Evil 6, but you'll likely spend so much time with your head in your hands that you'll probably just miss them all.</p><p style=\"\">Whatever else could be improved upon in this game is moot, since its fundamentals as a third-person action game are just plain badly implemented. After the great last couple of installments in the core Resident Evil franchise, it's astounding that the basic act of playing RE6 doesn't feel at least as good as it did in those games. On the surface, RE6 is made up of the same third-person shooting, button-prompt-driven melee combat, and inventory management, though it goes further in the direction of similar Western action games that focus on moving and shooting in tandem, largely at the expense of the series' traditionally deliberate style of gameplay. But it doesn't go far enough to produce a satisfying game of singular intent. In trying to have it both ways, clumsily mixing that more active style of shooter with vestigial elements of the series' survival-horror past, and peppering the entire thing with excessive <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time events</a> and nearly hands-off action set pieces, RE6 takes a tremendous step backwards in terms of basic playability.</p><p style=\"\">The reasons for this are too numerous for any one review, but here goes. The character movement is awkward, the aiming and shooting are stiff, and your basic interactions with enemies feel unresponsive and grossly unsatisfying. With a laser sight that swims around wildly within the targeting reticle and enemies that sometimes feel like bullets are passing right through them, the shooting makes a lousy first impression. And don't get me started on how clumsy the camera can get when you're trying to move around in tight spaces, or about the game's nasty habit of cutting back from a cinematic sequence with your camera angle pointed not only in a different direction than you left it, but also away from the thing you need to focus your attention on. The trusty old 180-degree turn from previous games sometimes turns only your character while leaving the camera stationary, exposing you to unnecessary risk as you then have to manually swivel the perspective around after you've wasted time expecting a basic game mechanic to work like it's supposed to. Playing RE6 is like suffering the death of a thousand cuts, as one minor annoyance and unavoidable death after another chip away at your enjoyment.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2226451-re6e3jakesherryustanak01bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226451\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2226451-re6e3jakesherryustanak01bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226451\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2226451-re6e3jakesherryustanak01bmpjpgcopy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's a little too much pushing the stick in one direction and holding A here.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Most of Resident Evil 6 is marred by a glaring lack of that video game critic's old standby, polish. Every time you're killed instantly by an unavoidable scripted event, it feels like a good opportunity to turn the game off and never turn it back on. Seriously, there were multiple times in more than one level where I or someone I was playing co-op with was killed by some timed event--say, a truck hurtling into the area from offscreen--that you just couldn't avoid if you didn't know it was coming, and often don't even <i>see</i> coming if you don't happen to have the camera pointed randomly in the right direction. The game rarely communicates what it wants you to do, leaving you in many of the game's long, multi-phase boss fights to blindly waste ammo as you try to figure out whether you're effectively doing any damage to an enemy that barely reacts visibly to your attacks.</p><p style=\"\">There are other basic design issues that make the game feel like a chore, like the inability to stop time even while you're trying to change your brightness or control scheme. You're never even alerted to the existence of a cover system or dodge mechanics outside of loading-screen tooltips that, at least on the Xbox version I played through, were typically onscreen for less than a second. But the game sure does make a point of driving home how Quick Time events work in its laughable tutorial segment. It never even attempts to explain the quirks of ducking and rolling, which require you to use the same button combo in different ways, but it goes out of its way to make sure you know to push the stick down and hold the A button every time you need to run toward the camera through a barely-interactive scripted chase scene. That's a telling example of the poor attention to detail here where basic playability is concerned.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">To be fair, the more you play RE6, the more you'll adapt to the long list of quirks that initially conspire to make the combat in this game a miserable experience. Eventually it becomes <i>less</i> miserable, but it never clicks and feels satisfying and engaging the way the best action games do. Think about the brightest lights in the genre on this generation of consoles. For me, it's games like <a href=\"/infamous/3030-20599/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20599\">Infamous</a> and <a href=\"/dead-space/3030-20800/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20800\">Dead Space</a> that give you immediate, absolute control over your abilities and impart the information for you to make split-second decisions about how to deal with any threat. Those games just feel right. Even at its best, playing RE6 feels like fumbling around blindly in the dark by comparison. The impression is of a game that underwent little to no playtesting, to see how actual human beings would respond to the mechanics and systems that make up the gameplay, and to refine and fix them in the places where they weren't working.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2226446-re6e3crossoverleonhelenajakesherry03bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226446\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2226446-re6e3crossoverleonhelenajakesherry03bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226446\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2226446-re6e3crossoverleonhelenajakesherry03bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2226446-re6e3crossoverleonhelenajakesherry03bmpjpgcopy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Be prepared to fight this exact boss battle twice before the game is over.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As Resident Evil goes, this game's justification for its own existence is questionable in the first place. <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a> went to admirable lengths to upend the series' longstanding fiction by bringing in new antagonists and a new location, and I felt like <a href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">5</a> was already pushing its luck by turning right around and going back to the well with <a href=\"/albert-wesker/3005-627/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-627\">Wesker</a> and the <a href=\"/umbrella-corporation/3015-204/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-204\">Umbrella Corporation</a> yet again. But at least that game was bold enough to resolve those longstanding story threads with finality, explaining and killing off pretty much everything there was to explain and kill off. Then along comes RE6 with... Neo-Umbrella and the son of Wesker. That's really the most inspired premise they could conceive? I'll grant that this game is awkwardly timed at the end of a console cycle, and it's too soon to go back to the drawing board and completely rebuild Resident Evil from the ground up, but couldn't <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a> have just put together a more modest side story to fill the necessary spot on the release calendar until then? (Actually, I guess they already <a href=\"/resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city/3030-34553/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34553\">did that</a>.)</p><p style=\"\">Whether RE6's premise strains plausibility or not, the series has had good luck in the past with multiple concurrent campaigns starring different characters, and here you get a whopping four of them. Dandy-haired <a href=\"/leon-s-kennedy/3005-649/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-649\">Leon Kennedy</a>'s vignette feels the most like an old Resident Evil, with the highest concentration of cathedrals and rotting zombies in the game. Square-jawed <a href=\"/chris-redfield/3005-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris Redfield</a>'s campaign then goes and does a middling <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-565\">Gears of War</a> impression, with an increased emphasis on taking cover and shooting at enemies who shoot back at you. Then son-of-Wesker <a href=\"/jake-muller/3005-23066/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23066\">Jake</a> moves through a campaign with a disjointed mix of shooting, ill-conceived stealth sequences, and an indestructible Big Bad who chases you through every area like a modern-day <a href=\"/nemesis/3005-3189/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3189\">Nemesis</a>. Once you finish the three storylines, you unlock a hidden fourth campaign so top-secret it's mentioned on the back of the box, one that's meant to give some additional context to everything you've seen over the last 20 hours or so.</p><p style=\"\">The idea of this many criss-crossing storylines is a great one, and you do get little nuggets of info in each campaign that expand on the events in the others. It's hard to get too excited about anything that happens in the game, though, revolving as it does around yet another iteration of the <a href=\"/t-virus/3015-42/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-42\">X-virus</a> that's always been at the center of the whole zombie mess. Nothing of major importance to the Resident Evil continuity takes place here, as every character and story thread introduced at the outset has either been blandly resolved or summarily dismissed by the end, resulting in a conclusion that, as far as Chris and Leon are concerned, might as well never have happened. More damningly, as the game wears on, it becomes more and more disappointing how much content is flat-out recycled from previous campaigns. By the time I got to Jake's campaign and especially into that last one, I was replaying sequences and boss fights on a disturbingly regular basis that I'd already played before. Sometimes you at least get to take part from a different angle, but just as often you're literally fighting the exact same boss fight you already did a few hours ago. It's especially glaring that if you play the campaigns in the recommended order, the first last-boss encounter you face is identical to the very last one. That's a pretty anti-climactic way to end such a huge production, and it's emblematic of the many aspects of RE6 that just weren't thought all the way through.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229302-8052_10150905140719900_1919900266_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229302\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.50416666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229302-8052_10150905140719900_1919900266_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229302\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2229302-8052_10150905140719900_1919900266_n.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2229302-8052_10150905140719900_1919900266_n.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Playable characters cross paths to mixed results through each campaign.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game at least earns a few points for sheer audacity. Its scope is enormous; the volume of huge, detailed environmental art crammed in here could fill two or three similar games of average length. And many of those areas are framed and lit to great dramatic effect, though others look like they had less attention given to them, and the frame rate is low enough across the board to diminish the effect of actually moving around in them. Many of the monster designs are creepy as hell (a human torso attached to spider legs and wielding an assault rifle seems like something that just should not exist), and the bosses are plenty big and menacing and impressive to watch, though that effect is often lost in the frustrating trial-and-error required to fight them. The production values in the cinematics are top-shelf, and the character performances are quite well done, with <a href=\"/troy-baker/3040-93651/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93651\">Troy Baker</a> further cementing his status as the new <a href=\"/nolan-north/3040-80008/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\">Nolan North</a> in a nicely snarky turn as the wisecracking, in-it-for-the-money merc Jake. And as flat as I found the broad story, there were a couple of honestly affecting human moments that got to me a little bit. But once the moment is over, they don't really go anywhere.</p><p style=\"\">By the time I'd slogged through the two-dozen-plus hours of the four main campaigns, I couldn't find it in myself to care much about the return of The Mercenaries, the score-based time attack mode that I used to play obsessively in past games, or Agent Hunt, which lets you match your way into another player's game as a monster so you can give them some trouble. That's a great idea, though most of the monsters you end up with aren't very capable or much fun to control in practice. Mercs is the same as it ever was, which is fine, and by the time I was done with the game, I felt well enough attuned to the combat that I could have given it a pretty effective go, I just had no energy or desire left to do so. It's worth noting you can once again play the whole game in co-op if you like, though your ever-present, indestructible AI buddy is actually pretty effective in combat, except for the rare moment where they refuse to get themselves over to a tandem door you need to open. That doesn't happen often, but always seems to happen at the worst times.</p><p style=\"\">At a glance, Resident Evil 6 is built on the basic blueprint of a good action game, swaddled in what must have been one of the most expensive productions in video game history. You could offer a lot of ifs about how to make this game better: if the fat were trimmed out in service of a shorter, tighter campaign; if the designers had drilled down more intently on one style of gameplay rather than trying to cover all of them; if the player's core interactions with the game were simply as refined as they should have been. But in the real world, we're left with what's in the box. It's hard to fathom how Resident Evil, which almost singlehandedly redefined the action genre just two installments ago, has now become such a strange, mediocre pastiche of the better games this series once inspired.

That includes Deus Ex and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35850\" href=\"/dishonored/3030-35850/\">Dishonored</a> co-designer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-3772\" href=\"/harvey-smith/3040-3772/\">Harvey Smith</a>, who himself stumbled with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9883\" href=\"/deus-ex-invisible-war/3030-9883/\">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a>. Smith still doggedly pursues this very specific type of experience, long after <a data-ref-id=\"3040-2978\" href=\"/warren-spector/3040-2978/\">Warren Spector</a> paired up with a mouse. Dishonored is not the groundbreaking achievement Deus Ex was, but that would be asking too much. It is, however, a meaningful and successful reinvention of the core ideas behind Deus Ex with a singular focus on making this dense style of game more accessible.</p><p style=\"\">You need a reason for the killing, and Dishonored wastes little time giving a reason to be vengeful. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-23124\" href=\"/corvo/3005-23124/\">Corvo Attano</a>’s primary task in life is protecting the Empress of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3813\" href=\"/dunwall/3035-3813/\">Dunwall</a>, a trade city (imagine a steampunk <a data-ref-id=\"3035-63\" href=\"/city-17/3035-63/\">City 17</a>) wrecked by an awful plague transferred by an ever-growing population of rats. Corvo was sent abroad to seek help from the nearby lands, only to return with word that Dunwall will soon be locked away to rot. It is dire times for Dunwall, and the city is ripe for revolution. Magical assassins appear, kill the Empress, and kidnap her daughter and successor to the throne, Emily. You’re framed for the murder, and are sent to prison. Corvo is eventually freed by a group called The Loyalists, Dunwall insiders who know the truth. If he helps take down the tyrannical leader now ruling Dunwall, they will clear his name. And so establishes the general structure of Dishonored. The Loyalists are holed up at a tiny pub in Dunwall, which acts as a moment to catch your breath between missions, learn about the next target, purchase upgrades, and interact with the various characters.</p><p style=\"\">Though presented in the first-person, this style of game has never really been about shooting. It’s always been about expansive player agency by way of interacting with a complex series of layered <a data-ref-id=\"3015-218\" href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\">AI</a> systems, and manipulating that with your toolset. This approach makes for an experience where every player comes away with a different story, and crystalized the idea of emergent gameplay before that became a buzz word. The lack of mechanical proficiency has been a problem, though, a stumbling block for anyone who wasn’t around for the Deus Ex zeitgeist, and can’t understand tolerating a game where one of the player’s primary abilities just isn’t very fun. Dishonored addresses this, from top to bottom. Everything about the combat feels good, from basic shooting to swordfights. An easy-to-use counterattack system makes it effortless to take on five or six enemies at once, and feel in complete control. Besides making Dishonored a more competent, accessible game, it simultaneously solves another design issue found in both this and more stealth-focused games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\" href=\"/metal-gear-solid/3030-16140/\">Metal Gear Solid</a>. Getting caught no longer means you’re immediately reaching for the quick load button, and can instead choose to tackle the enemies with your array of combat options, or quickly skitter away with a little dose of magic.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2340056-arriving_at_golden_cat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340056\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.59791666666667\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2340056-arriving_at_golden_cat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340056\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2340056-arriving_at_golden_cat.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There is no hub world, but you will sometimes revisit old locations.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Corvo is one of the few chosen by a mysterious force known as The Outsider, a supernatural being who exists both in and outside of reality, and has the ability to imbue people with a special mark. This mark gives them access to a range of special powers, and these help Dishonored break from its Deus Ex lineage, and establish its own identity. It’s not just Deus Ex set in a different city. Though it shares DNA, the few but vital powers <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1412\" href=\"/arkane-studios-sa/3010-1412/\">Arkane Studios</a> has created are revelatory. Blink, the first power, is also the most important one. Blink allows the player to instantly transport to wherever the reticule is pointed at, and if pointed at the top of a structure, it’ll even automatically climb it for you. Suddenly, the reason the buildings are so damn tall in Dishonored make sense. Blink means gameplay is no longer just horizontal but vertical, which exponentially multiplies your options in any given scenario. And blink is just the start. Other powers allow you to take control of people and animals, another one stops time and can eventually be used to have someone kill themselves with their own bullet. How? Pause time when the shot is fired, possess them, and place them in front of where you just were. Combined with a proper combat system, Dishonored encourages rampant experimentation.</p><p style=\"\">Here’s just one example. Three guards line a river, each of them patrolling in different directions. Flip on dark vision to study their route, which creates vision cones for the enemies. You <i>could</i> take each of them out from a distance with your crossbow. You <i>could</i> possess the first one, have him commit suicide by jumping off a bridge, and sneak around the other two. You <i>could</i> stop time and just run right through them, and they won’t have enough time to react. You <i>could</i> summon a swarm of rats, which distracts them to another side of the map. You <i>could</i> rewire the nearby security system to attack everyone but you. You <i>could</i> possess a nearby fish, and swim underneath the river. The possibilities aren’t endless, but there are enough to make you feel right dizzy, and each is personally rewarding in different ways. You’ll want to invest in the base version of each power, unlocked by collecting runes in each level, just for variety’s sake. You can’t get everything your first time through the game, and you won’t want to. Eventually, you’ll settle into a rhythm, and find what works for you. I never invested runes into an ability that turned enemies to ash when killed because I was always avoiding killing anyone.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It’s important players are able to tell their own gameplay story in Dishonored, since the story the game is trying to tell isn’t great. Every beat is predictable, twists and all, and the few noteworthy mysteries, like the Outsider, are never satisfyingly explained. In retrospect, Deus Ex’s story was pretty silly, too, but it worked at the time. Standards have changed. Much of what you will learn about the broader world comes from books scattered about, but not every book is unique. The passages begin repeating pretty quickly, which meant I usually stopped trying to find them at all. There are similar storytelling missteps throughout Dishonored. Graffiti repeats ad nauseum, as does idle dialogue. The line “think you’ll get your own squad after what happened last night?” comes up again and again, and does a terrific job of breaking any sense of immersion. For a world otherwise superbly realized, these moments prompted me to tune out. Some characters show promise, but besides Pendleton, whose brothers are part of one of the better missions, none are woven into story enough to be memorable. And I can’t tell if it’s a good thing I didn’t realize Susan Sarandon voiced one of the characters or not. While the voice acting isn’t bad, the celebrities didn't seem necessary. I suppose the story disappointment wouldn’t sting so much if it didn’t come hand-in-hand with the climax playing out poorly as gameplay, too. For a game full of memorable missions, the final outing, where skills honed over the previous 10-to-15 hours should be pushed to the max, is mostly boring. Dishonored also commits the frustrating storytelling sin of ending out of nowhere and without enough resolution.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2340057-01_boyle_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340057\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.55813953488372\" data-width=\"7568\" style=\"width: 7568px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2340057-01_boyle_party.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340057\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2340057-01_boyle_party.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2340057-01_boyle_party.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some of the most memorable moments don't involve combat.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Fortunately, what comes before is so, so good. Each mission has a pretty similar setup, with players being dropped off outside of a new location by boat, and asked to eliminate one or more targets. How you choose to do that is completely up to you. Stabbing them in the back is an old standby, but there far more creative ways to take care of your enemies in Dishonored. Why not possess them and toss them off a balcony? Maybe think about turning on a nearby steamer and burning them alive? If you’re patient, too, there is always an option that won’t require killing them. It usually requires coming across a document in the world or overhearing a specific line of dialogue, but it comes with a worthwhile payoff. The Pendleton brothers, for example, can be kidnapped, stripped of their tongues, and sent to work in their own underground mines, unable to tell anyone how they’ve been wronged. Deliciously evil, right? I won’t spoil the others; discovery is half the fun. And do yourself a favor and <i>don’t</i> watch any of the mission walkthrough videos that are floating around the Internet. Some of them spoil terrific moments best experienced yourself. But, yes, the mission set in a masked party is as good as it looks and sounds, and the sheer variety of ways to complete it will prompt you to load it over and over again. Interesting mission setups, constantly changing locations, and always diverse moment-to-moment interactions with the game’s enemies is Dishonored’s killer combination.</p><p style=\"\">It’s a good thing, too, since Dishonored is an excellent game, and one worthy of your attention. Dishonored’s greatest contribution to the genre games like Deus Ex helped establish will be best appreciated by those who’ve been with it from the start, but Arkane has made a game rooted in manipulating artificial intelligence that plays just as well to the guy or gal who wants to shoot stuff.

After a brilliant set of gameplay upgrades in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31439\" href=\"/nba-2k11/3030-31439/\" slug=\"nba-2k11\">NBA 2K11</a>, and a host of mode and feature changes in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35564\" href=\"/nba-2k12/3030-35564/\" slug=\"nba-2k12\">NBA 2K12</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38377\" href=\"/nba-2k13/3030-38377/\" slug=\"nba-2k13\">NBA 2K13</a> feels...well, a bit samey. Which isn't to say that the quality of 2K13 has taken a nosedive. On the court, 2K13 is as strong an entry as there's been in this series. But the changes it does make largely feel like changes for the sake of change, rather than anything particularly beneficial to the cause. This is certainly a very good basketball game, but it doesn't make the definitive argument for itself the way 2K11 and 2K12 did.</p><p style=\"\">At the very least, NBA 2K13 does fix some things that were wrong with 2K12. Most notably, passing is a lot better this time around. Last year there was perhaps an over abundance of intercepted or borked passes, even in seemingly safe circumstances. This year, you're only going to get intercepted when you're careless with the ball, or up against a particularly sneaky defender. Online play has also finally seen an overhaul for the better. Lag has killed this series time and time again, and I'm happy to report that 2K13 really does seem to excise those demons. Save for one or two matches that suffered from a bit of stuttering now and again, I was pretty much able to play without any real issue online.</p><p style=\"\">Other changes were perhaps less necessary. The right stick, for instance, has been switched from a pure shooting method to a home for dribbling moves. Moving the stick in different directions and combos lets you dribble the ball from side to side, through the legs, and whatever other fancy moves you might be looking to do. Players more enamored with the stick as a shooting method can return it to that form by holding down the left trigger button. It's an interesting change that admittedly does give you a bit more control over your dribbling, but it's also largely an unnecessary one. It's the sort of thing that sounds great on the back of a box, but doesn't really add much to the equation.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">To be fair, NBA 2K13's controls are already a dense equation to begin with. 2K Sports has had to map so many different things to so many different control schemes over the last several years, and in that time it hasn't removed very much. That leaves NBA 2K13 feeling a bit overwhelming to all but the most dedicated players. If you're just the sort that wants to play along with the season in some pick-up games and maybe dabble around with The Association mode, 2K13 presents a depth of complexity that is, at times, harrowing. For those willing to learn the ropes, there's a great deal of reward here. But getting to that reward is a daunting process that requires more tutorials than is perhaps reasonable for a mass market game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2290932-nba2k13_derrickrose.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2290932\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2290932-nba2k13_derrickrose.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2290932\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2290932-nba2k13_derrickrose.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mapping the dribble moves to the right stick sounds more interesting than it actually is.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That said, NBA 2K13 is still a blast on the court. The controls are tight, the AI is smart, and the presentation is second to none. It's not just the graphics engine, which is still great, but the little details in the players. Their mannerisms, their personalities actually shine through. LeBron looks, moves, and feels like LeBron. And he's just one of dozens of players that look and feel wholly authentic. Between the visual presentation, and the still stellar commentary from Kevin Harlan, Steve Kerr, and Clark Kellogg, NBA 2K13 does a better job of emulating an NBA TV broadcast than even last year's game.</p><p style=\"\">One of the best things about the 2K series in recent years is how it's handled the league's legacy. In 2K11, there was the fantastic Michael Jordan challenge, and last year's game went even further by including a huge crop of classic teams, paired up with their most noteworthy rivals of the era. By comparison, this year's inclusion of the dueling Olympic Dream Teams (the 1992 squad, as well as this year's squad), is a bit of a let-down. Not because there's anything wrong with including those teams, but just because it's not nearly the educational, nor entertainment experience that last year's rivalries mode was. There are still classic teams here, but they're only available in quick matches, and none of the nifty presentation nor detailed histories of those teams are present.</p><p style=\"\">Outside of the USA Basketball inclusion, the only major new feature is the MyTeam mode. Ostensibly a riff on EA's Ultimate Team cash-grabs, MyTeam lets you buy card packs of players you can use to build out your own team. You buy those packs with VC, a new in-game currency that, in a smart divergence from the Ultimate Team formula, you can earn via multiple game modes. The MyPlayer mode, for instance, implements VC by including player upgrades you can buy. But those same VC points can be carried over into MyTeam. You can, of course, also buy chunks of VC for actual money, if you're the impatient type. Thankfully, you'll earn decent enough amounts of VC just by playing, so you won't <i>have</i> to crack open your non-virtual wallet.</p><p style=\"\">MyTeam is a fun enough distraction, but like Ultimate Team, it doesn't have much staying power. Instead, you'll likely find yourself more engrossed in the MyPlayer and Association modes. Last year's MyPlayer mode was something of a revelation, and this year it's no worse off, though no better either. Some new things, like superstar players being able to design their own custom shoes, are nifty additions, but that's about all. Mostly, these are the modes you remember from last year, which in my estimation is still a good thing.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/102330/2293841-391355_10152047178015305_920365058_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2293841\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/102330/2293841-391355_10152047178015305_920365058_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2293841\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/102330/2293841-391355_10152047178015305_920365058_n.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/102330/2293841-391355_10152047178015305_920365058_n.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It's great to have the two dream teams, but it doesn't suitably replace last year's excellent NBA's Greatest mode.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you're wondering about the \"Executive Produced by Jay-Z\" emblazoned on the box, Young Hov's involvement effectively boils down to a fancy wrapper. He apparently presided over the game's look and feel by selecting the soundtrack, giving some insight on visual design, and awkwardly including concert footage of him in the game's opening movie. It's a meaningless distinction that has no real bearing on the game you're playing, outside of the in-game inclusion of longtime holdout Charles Barkley, and a celebrity team that includes two Jersey Shore cast members and Justin Bieber.</p><p style=\"\">I remember when <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13056\" href=\"/espn-nfl-2k5/3030-13056/\" slug=\"espn-nfl-2k5\">ESPN NFL 2K5</a> did basically the same thing.

When it works, The Journey is a breezy little confection, a simple, directed romp through the fantasy lands of <a href=\"/albion/3035-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-52\">Albion</a> that's shot through with Fable's special brand of charm and a healthy dose of honest-to-goodness drama. When it doesn't work, it's not much better than <a href=\"/steel-battalion-heavy-armor/3030-32695/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32695\">Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor</a>. Good thing it works a bit more often than not.</p><p style=\"\">The challenge of mushing Fable's traditionally free-wheeling role-playing style into a form suitable for Kinect's limited capabilities must have been a daunting one, and Lionhead met that challenge by...having your character walk forward automatically while you use both hands to fling magic at whatever <a href=\"/hobbes/3015-3283/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3283\">hobbes</a>, <a href=\"/balverine/3015-1675/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1675\">balverines</a>, and <a href=\"/hollow-man/3015-2412/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2412\">hollow men</a> come your way. Yes, contrary to what you may have heard, the game proceeds entirely on rails, but even if The Journey's action levels amount to little more than shooting galleries, there's still a bit of depth to the mixing and matching of magic within them. On your left hand, you've got a Force push of sorts that lets you stun enemies and then fling them around; on your right, you get a basic magical bolt spell that can later be morphed into an area-of-effect fireball and a powerful magic shard that can be split into multiple projectiles. You can also counter almost all enemy attacks with a quick left fist across your chest, and later levels get intense enough that you'll have to use all of these abilities pretty quickly in concert to make it through without taking too much damage.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2340468-fablethejourney_09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340468\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2340468-fablethejourney_09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340468\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2340468-fablethejourney_09.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The boss encounters don't really skimp on scale.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game does a decent job of mixing up the types of enemies it throws at you from one sequence to the next, so it's relatively rewarding to change up your spell usage, and incorporate the occasional explosive barrel or throw object, to take out foes. Plenty of later enemies also come with specific requirements, such as making you use your push spell to jerk a shield out of their hands before you can damage them. The game rewards you for dispatching enemies with style, like popping them up into the air then taking them out, or flinging them off of cliffs or into lava. So while the combat is pretty by-the-numbers and doesn't <i>demand</i> a lot of finesse (as long as it actually works--more on that later), you can at least get creative in the ways you deal with enemies, and you'll earn more experience points by playing with a little flair. There's a simple upgrade path that doesn't dramatically change the game, but at least lets you increase the usefulness of individual spells, make your horse stronger, or give yourself extra health.</p><p style=\"\">The Journey is longer than its dozen or so self-contained action levels, though. In between those on-foot sequences--which have you exploring ancient temples, infiltrating a hobbe camp, defending a homestead from a balverine attack, and routing a stinger infestation from a deserted township, among other things--you'll view Albion from the seat of your horse-drawn cart, where you can whip your trusty mare Seren into a gallop, and take the reins to steer back and forth around obstacles and pick up some experience orbs scattered around the road. I can't say these benign travel sequences are wildly exhilarating, aside from the occasional running fight with mounted hobbes or chase sequence involving some hideous monstrosity (which are only mildly exhilarating). But they do provide a good chance for some exposition between your hero Gabriel, a rotating cast of incidental characters, and Fable's omnipresent wizened old seer <a href=\"/theresa/3005-8389/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8389\">Theresa</a> about the ancient evil du jour that's threatening the land. And believe it or not, spending so much time watching the countryside roll by over my horse's hindquarters actually did go some length toward creating the illusion of a single long journey through a big, contiguous land. Know that this is a one-way trip, though, with no real meaningful choice about where you go. The path branches here and there for a couple of minutes, but that only changes the occasional sight you may see along the side of the road. Most of this journey is already written in stone. It's worth noting that Lionhead moved to the latest iteration of <a href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-86\">Unreal Engine 3</a> for The Journey, and as a result, what Albion there is to see here has never looked nearly this good before.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2340474-ftj_bladebarrow_2_720p.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340474\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2340474-ftj_bladebarrow_2_720p.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340474\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2340474-ftj_bladebarrow_2_720p.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2340474-ftj_bladebarrow_2_720p.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Magically pulling hollow men apart limb by limb is pretty neat.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Your travels are punctuated by the occasional break to make camp, which is where the spirit of <a href=\"/peter-molyneux/3040-3890/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3890\">Peter Molyneux</a> truly lives in this game. That's where you lay your magic-gauntlet-covered hands on your horse's wounds to heal them, brush her dirt off, feed her an apple, and generally take a breather. These activities don't even constitute basic minigames--they're just simple gestures--but they contribute enough to your upgrades that it's worth doing them every time they come up. More to the point, these are the sort of quiet Molyneux moments that are supposed to engender an emotional connection between you and your animal, and...they aren't completely unsuccessful at doing that. Maybe I'm a big softy, but I actually felt responsible for not messing it up every time I had to grasp an arrow embedded in my horse's rear end and very gingerly remove it without hurting her. The first time you pull too hard and she recoils in pain, you might just feel like a real jerk about it.</p><p style=\"\">Then again, the only thing you can feel when the game messes it up for you is rage. The Journey is a simple and inoffensive game right up till the minute the poor reliability of Kinect suddenly makes you feel like you can't play it at all. There were several instances in combat where all of my spells were flying off in seemingly random directions and the game constantly refused to acknowledge my blocking gesture, causing me to die over and over on what should have been an extremely simple encounter, and that made me want to turn the game off and throw it out the window (as you should do with any game that refuses your best efforts to play it). For what it's worth, I never had any real trouble guiding my horse in the traveling bits, which isn't very responsive but at least worked like it should. The quality of the combat gameplay seemed overly sensitive to the lighting conditions in my living room, though, which I experimented with extensively. Once you at least get Kinect reading you consistently, there's an in-game calibration scheme that seemed to make the aiming more reliable, but an onscreen reticle indicating where your shots are actually going to land probably would have fixed all of this in the first place.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">(For those interested, I've included the game's own tutorial for making Kinect behave itself.)</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-height=\"360\" data-src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9Gd2JhNGv3c?wmode=opaque\" data-width=\"640\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9Gd2JhNGv3c?wmode=opaque\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p style=\"\">In light of the occasional technical problems, The Journey gets by largely on its charm, which is in abundance. There's mirth and melancholy in equal measure over the course of the storyline, which isn't especially original but is rendered effectively nonetheless. As cheeky and lighthearted as Fable is (and this installment is no exception), it says something about the game's talent for melodrama that you end up genuinely feeling sorry for certain characters on several occasions when bad things happen to them, and the game culminates in a moment that will likely be among the most poignant seen in a game this year. The whole thing is just so gosh darn British, too, which I imagine is less of a selling point if you <i>are</i> British. That pervasive sprinkling of refined, humorous nonsense makes The Journey feel a little more like one worth taking, even when some of its nuts and bolts are less appealing.</p>", "deck": "The Journey's heart is in the right place.

Big city folk, mostly, all reliant on their \"public transportation\" or their \"bicycles\" instead of getting behind the wheel of a machine that may very well kill them someday. That tender grasp, toeing the line between our world in the next, is the deep, dark core behind our fascination with the automobile. Video games represent society's relationship with cars in a variety of ways, from kart racers for the kids all the way up to intense simulations that all but <i>require</i> you to build a cockpit facsimile in the middle of your home. Any racing video game--especially one on a console--is going to split the difference between those two extremes, but games that really try to appeal to the \"arcade\" audience as well as the simulation crowd usually end up producing a watered-down mess that pleases no one. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-37648\" href=\"/forza-horizon/3030-37648/\" slug=\"forza-horizon\">Forza Horizon</a> threads the needle and pulls it off surprisingly well.</p><p style=\"\">Horizon is an open-world, thrills-first twist on the Forza franchise that starts with the great physics and performance that the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-199\" href=\"/forza-motorsport/3025-199/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport\">Forza Motorsport</a> series is already known for and adds the sorts of things you'd expect to find in an open-world racer. There are tiers of events that unlock in chunks as you finish out the previous tier, sets of \"unsanctioned\" street races that aren't really any different from the main events, but they earn you cash instead of progression points, races against the game's cast of characters (which pop up as you move from one tier of main events to the next), and one-off showcase events that get you cars by asking you to race against airplanes, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-361\" href=\"/helicopter/3055-361/\" slug=\"helicopter\">helicopters</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2434\" href=\"/hot-air-balloon/3055-2434/\" slug=\"hot-air-balloon\">hot-air balloons</a>. Ultimately, the showcase events are heavy on the \"show\" aspect of things, because they feel more like time trials with aircraft flying overhead the entire time.</p><p style=\"\">The showcase events pop up as your driver becomes more popular, which is one of the other types of progression built into the game. You earn popularity points for fancy driving, and it feels like an offshoot of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-430\" href=\"/project-gotham-racing/3025-430/\" slug=\"project-gotham-racing\">Project Gotham</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3015-115\" href=\"/kudos/3015-115/\" slug=\"kudos\">kudos</a> system. You'll get points for burnouts, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-74\" href=\"/drifting/3015-74/\" slug=\"drifting\">drifting</a>, near misses, and other acts of genuine skill, but you'll also get points for trading paint with other racers or busting up street signs and other on-track obstacles. The notion of earning points for driving that lacks finesse is perhaps the most un-Forza-like part of the entire game, but don't mistake this for a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-76\" href=\"/burnout/3025-76/\" slug=\"burnout\">Burnout</a> game. There's nothing to be gained by slamming into opposing cars, though smash-ups don't feel like they're as catastrophic as they can be in Forza Motorsport, mostly because all of the car damage is merely cosmetic.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227079-007198.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227079\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227079-007198.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227079\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227079-007198.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The photo mode returns, giving you control over focus, filters, and more.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">When you're not racing, there's a large open world to explore, and the game gives you a few reasons to do some cruising. First, there are 100 signs hidden in the environment that each give you a 1 percent discount on car upgrades when smashed. Find them all and your upgrades are free. Also, nine \"barn finds\" pop up over the course of play. These are old cars that have been hidden around the world in barns that exist off the beaten path. When one activates, an area of your map lights up to give you the general location of a barn, so you'll have to explore that area in order to figure out how to find the exact spot. You'll drive past plenty of these collectibles over the natural course of the game, as well as various speed cameras and zones that measure how fast you're moving through specific spots and record it to an online leaderboard.</p><p style=\"\">So there's a good variety of things to do around the world, but if you'd rather fast travel, you can warp back to the central hub or to any of the fast travel points you've uncovered. Warping to those points costs money at first, though there are a few simple tasks you can complete at each hub that eventually reduce that cost to zero. If you're the impatient type that hates exploring and driving from one objective to the next, you'll find this fast travel system to be lacking. But the game's driving model is interesting enough to make the journey worthwhile, so just calm down, OK?<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Online, the game allows up to eight players to get in and race. You can get right down to it with a series of preset events or you can free roam in the world, which allows players to get into co-op challenges. These challenges require all connected players to perform specific tasks. Some are passive, like driving lots and lots of miles across all sessions. Others are active, like one that requires all players to pass through a speed trap while driving above a certain speed. Oh, the catch there is that all the drivers need to pass the speed trap within a few seconds of each other, so you'll have to talk it out over your headsets and get in a proper line of cars to nail it properly. The list of co-op challenge isn't huge, and it never gets quite as inventive as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5648\" href=\"/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/\" slug=\"burnout-paradise\">Burnout Paradise</a>'s similar system did, but it gives you something to shoot for when in free roam, which is great. You can also get into playground games like Infection, which gives one of the players a horrible disease that spreads to other cars after a collision, so the last car standing wins. King makes one player the king, and the other players try to smash into the king to steal the crown. A timer ticks up while you've on the throne. It's simple but effective stuff that gives you more to shoot for than just racing.</p><p style=\"\">You'll still upgrade your cars--either automatically or by picking out specific parts--but there's no tuning aspect to Forza Horizon, so you won't be directly adjusting things like ride height. You won't be trading cars or tuning setups in an auction house, but the vinyl editor from the previous games makes it over intact. You can even import your vinyl groups from Forza Motorsport 4, which is great news for me since I created this extremely basic and dumb (but accurate!) bottom-row Space Invader two or three games ago, and it's been haunting my player storefront ever since. Players can sell or give away their vinyl groups via a simplified version of the store setup from previous Forza games.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2225754-screenshot_forza_horipqkex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2225754\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2225754-screenshot_forza_horipqkex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2225754\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2225754-screenshot_forza_horipqkex.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2225754-screenshot_forza_horipqkex.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>This angle is NUTS, you guys!!!!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The only time Forza Horizon doesn't look fantastic is when you're standing still. A lot of the grass textures that you'll see at the edges of the road are pretty rough up close. But the not-so-secret secret there is that you probably won't stop moving very often. Virtual Colorado has terrific lighting and a day/night cycle that gives you a lot of different looks for each environment, from the sun peeking over the mountains to fireworks over the Horizon Festival's hub zone at night. It feels like a genuine, lived-in place that's lively in a way that makes Forza Motorsport feel stodgy and sterile by comparison. That feel is supported by a trio of radio stations with DJs that often comment on what's going on in the overall tournament in-between a variety of very \"now\" music selections that fit the game's tone quite well. Let's face it: this gaudy spectacle of a fireworks-laden race festival is just crying out for as much wobble bass as possible, and the Horizon Bass Arena station features just enough dubstep to either keep you excited or make you sick, depending on your stance.</p><p style=\"\">If you have a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\" href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" slug=\"kinect-support\">Kinect</a> hooked up, you'll have a reason to shout over all that Mord Fustang, Skrillex, and Wolfgang Gartner as you can use the voice recognition on the Kinect to point your GPS at the next event or other important locations. This is easily--and more precisely--completed on the game's map screen, but shouting \"GPS! Next event!\" and seeing the driving line come up and point you in the proper direction is still somewhat novel.

But most importantly, it manages to simultaneously feel like a Forza game while also letting in more of what makes racing games fun for all players, rather than staying strictly focused on those of us who want strict simulations of varying realism. It's got a cockpit view, but it also gives you points for smashing through street signs and performing totally sick J-turns. That might sound like a contradiction that would cripple a game, but Horizon manages to make all of these different elements fit together in a way that seems natural.

The beloved, long-neglected franchise, placed in the assured hands of the veteran developer who’s about as synonymous with turn-based strategy as, say, chess? This is how the universe is supposed to work, right?</p><p style=\"\">Despite the addictive, turn-based parallels, below the surface, Civ and XCOM are very different beasts. There’s a slow-building amiability to Civ, where time is measured in millennia and victory need not necessarily involve guns and ammo. I think it’s important for me to be crystal clear in saying that <i>this is not the case</i> with XCOM: Enemy Unknown. There’s still a “one more turn” seductiveness to the experience, albeit a far more grueling one.</p><p style=\"\">Weight is given to what seems to be a deliberately by-the-numbers alien invasion routine in Enemy Unknown by the fact that your grunts-with-guns military might is so sorely outmatched even by the first wave of invaders, that your only chance for survival--nevermind victory--is to muster up all the help you can. Even--nay, especially--if it means turning the invaders’ own fantastical technology against them. Though the action’s all turn-based, this is a pressure-cooker of a game, where resources are constantly stretched thin, you’re hopelessly outmatched by invading alien forces, and every choice is a tough one, with hard consequences to follow.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2339165-situationroom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2339165\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2339165-situationroom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2339165\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2339165-situationroom.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Who will you save?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While Firaxis has instilled Enemy Unknown with a blistering kind of difficulty as an homage to UFO Defense, the key difference is that, unlike UFO Defense’s babe-to-the-wolves approach, Enemy Unknown spends generous hours peppering lessons about new mechanics into missions, holding back that next wrinkle until that due diligence is done. This isn’t to say Enemy Unknown holds the player’s hand, but that the challenge you face feels <i>fair.</i> Still, there are a lot of moving parts in this game--so many that it can be easy to overlook the importance of any one of them--though to do so is at your own potential detriment. The importance of vigilance cannot be overstated.</p><p style=\"\">Enemy Unknown is a game of two distinctly separate, yet intrinsically connected parts which could, with little embellishment, stand as games on their own. There’s the big picture, presented in diorama at XCOM HQ, your subterranean base. Fighting a losing-odds intergalactic battle takes more than grizzled dudes, though it takes those, too (more on that later). It takes money, resources, engineers, and researchers, with a built-in interdependency between all of them. You need researchers to come up with new and inventive ways to kill aliens; you need engineers to actually build the stuff the boffins in research think up; and you need money and resources collected on the battlefield to put it all together.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Money largely comes in the form of a monthly stipend from individual countries protected by the XCOM program, which can be bolstered by launching satellites over specific countries to provide more vigilant protection. Satellites are rich targets for the alien invaders, which means you need to also invest in airborne protection, which comes with its own expense. Neglect a country for too long, and its panic level will rise to the point that they’ll opt out of the XCOM program permanently, hobbling your finances over the long-term. Additional perks can be had from launching satellites over an entire continent, and you can rake in extra coin by selling bits of alien tech on the Grey Market, though since this is the same stuff you need to build gear for your soldiers on the battlefield, cashing in too liberally has its own drawbacks. It’s all air-tight checks and balances, and part of what makes all of this so excruciating is that you never, <i>ever</i>, have enough money to pursue every avenue you’d like to.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/2344187-2012_10_15_00001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2344187\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/2344187-2012_10_15_00001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2344187\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/2344187-2012_10_15_00001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/2344187-2012_10_15_00001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Your first, last, and best line of defense.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While money's always tight, the most precious resource in XCOM is time, which is richly ironic for a turn-based strategy game. Any action you choose to undertake--researching new alien tech, launching satellites, recruiting new squad members, excavating and building new facilities in your HQ, and more--requires a certain amount of time to complete, with that time dictated by the infrastructure of researchers, engineers, and power sources you have in place. I actually find that I enjoy the jigsaw nature of the administrative part of the Enemy Unknown experience most, though to neglect the battle on the ground is to invite unconditional defeat.</p><p style=\"\">While the clock is ticking ever-slowly while you’re tending to your HQ, the passage of time is accelerated significantly by scanning the globe for alien encounters, be they UFO sightings, abduction alerts, or missions dictated by the game’s surprisingly linear mission structure. Of course, when it rains it pours, and when a mission pops up, you’ll often have to choose between one of several locations, once again forcing you to make the hard choice of which ally to assist at any given moment, with those being ignored reacting in kind. Most of these missions are optional, though that’s only in the loosest sense of the word, since skipping a mission outright will have a crippling effect on your international relations more often than not. It can be awful tempting to let an abduction sighting slide for a couple of days until your next piece of tech has been completed, or your next payday comes around, but again, checks and balances.</p><p style=\"\">Once you actually dive into an on-the-ground mission, Enemy Unknown shifts into small-scale tactical mode, where you control a squad of soldiers, usually between four and six. While they’re not imbued with much distinct individual personality, your (often randomly, hilariously named) international strike force is far from anonymous. Each squad member maintains a persistent experience level for the duration of the game--or, more likely, the duration of their life--ranking up as they score kills in missions. Character classes like sniper, assault, heavy, and support are automatically assigned after their first rank-up, though after that it’s up to you to choose what sorts of class perks they’ll have with each additional rank. The class distinctions, as well as the perks you choose, can have a huge impact on battlefield effectiveness, as classes limit the types of weapons soldiers can carry, and perks can bolster everything from movement range to weapon capacity and accuracy. Rank often correlates to mission survivability, though the sophistication of the gear you equip your squad with--armor, primary and secondary weapons, and accessories--can be just as important. Maintaining a certain amount of class variety is also absolutely crucial, as going into a mission with all snipers is just bad news, I don’t care what rank they are.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2340258-2kgmkt_xcomeu_screenshot_squad6_general_gallery_post.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340258\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.51441241685144\" data-width=\"902\" style=\"width: 902px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2340258-2kgmkt_xcomeu_screenshot_squad6_general_gallery_post.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2340258\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2340258-2kgmkt_xcomeu_screenshot_squad6_general_gallery_post.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2340258-2kgmkt_xcomeu_screenshot_squad6_general_gallery_post.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Who you choose to deploy, and how you equip them, can mean all the difference.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">What makes all of the character stuff in Enemy Unknown so impactful is the relative fragility of your soldiers when they’re out on the field, and the permanence of their death. There is no virtue rewarded--nor tested--in Enemy Unknown as thoroughly as patience. As you advance your squad into the semi-randomized levels of wilderness, urban clusters, and alien ships and structures--all of them initially cloaked in the fog of war--one turn at a time, it’s all too tempting to rush into things, using both of your soldier’s per-turn actions to plow right into the unknown.</p><p style=\"\">This, along with neglecting to keep your squad members behind bits of still-far-from-impervious cover, is a fantastic way to see them come home in a bodybag. While you’ll be able to salvage any of the pricey gear they were using, once a soldier’s gone, they’re <i>gone</i>, along with all of the time you spent ranking them up. While there are occasions that you can use medikits to save critically wounded soldiers, even if you make it through a mission with your whole squad in one piece, anyone injured on the mission will be out of commission for a commensurate number of days. Your in-game advisors will let you know if you’re running dangerously low on deployable soldiers, or any other vital resources, though if you lack the foresight to keep more than a mission’s worth of soldiers in your ranks, it’s not hard to find yourself facing a mission that you’ve got no one to fight. This can lead to a rapid downward spiral of abandoning countries and dwindling resources.</p><p style=\"\">Most missions consist of locating and exterminating all alien threats, a fantastical menagerie that starts with little grey aliens, moves on to the hideous, zombifying arachnoid Chryssalids, and tops out with the physically frail, yet psychically terrifying Ethereals, among others, each of them requiring their own specific tactics to take down. You’ll occasionally be tasked with rescuing civilians, and there’s a strategic value to bringing your extraterrestrial foes back alive for interrogation. That’s only possible if you equip you soldiers with specialized gear, and invariably requires you get close enough to put the soldier in question directly in harm’s way. Like every action you take on the battlefield, it’s a gamble dictated by a number of variables--information the game makes available, but keeps just out of sight to prevent overwhelming the player with data. Even though the game uses simple percentages to clearly spell out the odds of a successful action, and there’s no reason to believe it’s fudging any of them for dramatic effect, the stakes are so high that every missed shot is absolutely excruciating.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63876/2341949-xcomgame_2012_10_10_17_27_11_60.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2341949\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63876/2341949-xcomgame_2012_10_10_17_27_11_60.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2341949\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63876/2341949-xcomgame_2012_10_10_17_27_11_60.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63876/2341949-xcomgame_2012_10_10_17_27_11_60.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can further personalize your troops, if amplified emotional loss is your thing.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Completing individual missions can take anywhere from fifteen minutes to, well, forever, depending on how liberally you use the game’s optional auto-save system and how obsessive you are about completing missions as cleanly as possible. This is an easy hole to fall down, as even the slightest mistake can snowball rapidly into a world-ending scenario. It can be a frustrating experience, no doubt, particularly when you find yourself in an entirely possible no-win situation deep into a campaign. But it’s rarely, if ever, unclear what action--or inaction--brought about your plight.</p><p style=\"\">Extreme fastidiousness notwithstanding, it can take around 30 hours to see through the single-player campaign in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, though like Firaxis’ Civilization series, there are so many different ways to prioritize the research, engineering, economic, and tactical elements of the game that it almost begs for multiple playthroughs. Add to that a one-on-one tactical multiplayer component that lets you build blended squads of human and alien soldiers, and you’ve got a package that will meet your turn-based strategy needs for the foreseeable future.</p><p style=\"\">It’s also well worth mentioning that, as the first XCOM game developed for consoles as much as it was for PCs, Enemy Unknown’s smartly economic, menu-driven interfaces handle intuitively with a gamepad. In fact, even on the PC, I found myself immediately eschewing mouse-and-keyboard controls in favor of the snappier gamepad controls. With game hardware where it is at the moment, Enemy Unknown naturally looks a bit better and loads a bit faster on the PC, but there’s no real reason not to play the game on whatever your platform of choice is.</p><p style=\"\">The cleverest part of XCOM: Enemy Unknown is how it bundles up all of its complexities and interdependencies and presents them in a package that, while not easy, is at least easily digested. It's often overwhelming, but in the best way possible. XCOM gives no quarter to players with the hubris to think they can play Enemy Unknown at a pace other than the one set <i>by</i> Enemy Unknown. This game will test your mettle in a way that will make old fans tingle with a sense of unforgiving nostalgia, and will make clear to newcomers just exactly what XCOM is all about.</p>", "deck": "Firaxis honors the XCOM name with turn-based strategy that shepherds players as expertly as it punishes, confidently balancing the micro and the macro all the while.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-533/", "platforms": "PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-37152/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/xcom-enemy-unknown/3030-37152/", "id": 37152, "name": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-10-16 10:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117244/", "id": 117244, "name": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/007-legends-review/1900-534/", "description": "<p style=\"\">What a waste <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38040\" href=\"/007-legends/3030-38040/\" slug=\"007-legends\">007 Legends</a> is.

And <i>Moonraker</i> of all goddamn things as your Roger Moore? And was anyone really chomping at the bit to experience the myriad thrills of <i>License to Kill</i>?</p><p style=\"\">What's worse, the structure of the game itself essentially robs any of these source materials of whatever thrill there may have been. The game opens with <a data-ref-id=\"3040-90200\" href=\"/daniel-craig/3040-90200/\" slug=\"daniel-craig\">Daniel Craig</a> Bond fighting on the roof of a train with some bad guy, while a female sniper is egged on over the radio by M to \"take the shot!\" She does, and accidentally hits Bond, who falls far into a nearby river. While floating around aimlessly, Bond apparently starts having flashbacks to those earlier missions. Though of course now, Craig's face and demeanor has been superimposed over his predecessors.</p><p style=\"\">You traipse through these newly Craig-washed Bond stories for a couple of missions at a time, usually infiltrating one villain or another's evil lair, shooting a bunch of guys, then exiting said lair. On its own, that isn't necessarily the worst progression a game can have, but the fact that the aforementioned shooting of guys is so crucially dull pretty much sinks it. Every mission feels more chore-like than exciting. Enemies just kind of wander around the environment until an alarm is set off, in which case they run at you guns blazing. Those are really the only two settings they have, and once they do go after you, they have an uncanny habit of walking into pieces of the level geometry or getting stuck next to a wall. Once you've picked off a few of them from afar, it's actually pretty easy to just run up and melee attack them, which kills them in one hit. Repeat this process across five different mission blocks, and that's the game, more or less.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4505/2294412-007_legends_dad_ltc_image_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2294412\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4505/2294412-007_legends_dad_ltc_image_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2294412\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4505/2294412-007_legends_dad_ltc_image_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>These Quick Timey fist fights are just about the worst.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While picking off hapless bad guys is mostly just boring, other areas of the game are more aggressively unlikable. For instance, there are a few different sequences where you'll find yourself in a \"crucial stealth area.\" This means that you have no choice but to sneak your way through a level section without being seen. While Bond's gadgetry is effective enough about taking out cameras and other automated detection devices, he's afforded no reasonable abilities with which to handle living guards. You can kill them with silenced weapons, or just distract them or knock them out with a dart gun, but you have no ability to move bodies out of sight. You can't even peek around corners, for Christ's sake.</p><p style=\"\">There are times in the non-stealth game where going stealthy might benefit you, such as when you're tasked with sneaking around offices, collecting pieces of intel, or using your smart phone to take pictures and engage some middling hacking minigames. But the mechanics you're handed just aren't useful enough to actually make that a worthwhile option. Most times, it's just easier to start picking guys off from afar, and then blitzkrieg them until there's no one left.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">And then there are the fist fights. Oh god, the fist fights.

These are miserable. If an enemy has a weapon, you have to just dodge and weave until eventually knocking it out of their hand.

Daniel Craig isn't around, so you've got a goofy soundalike mumbling his way through conversations with other poorly voiced characters. The actual context for each story is all but lost in translation, as well. You're just dropped into the mission, given a quick briefing, and off you go. Over the course of each mission, how much of the actual plot you'll get varies wildly. <i>Goldfinger</i>, for instance, does an okay job of setting up the titular villain's plan, but <i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</i> does a terrible job of explaining why you're there, who this woman you're rescuing is, or why you should care about any of it. It's perhaps expected that people just know this stuff, but considering most of these movies are at least 25 years old, that's a weird expectation.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2328626-010881.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2328626\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2328626-010881.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2328626\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/2328626-010881.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/2328626-010881.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>If a game can't even make the act of shooting bad guys fun, why even bother?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Worse still, the game has no ending.

Not great, or even particularly good, but functional. Up to 12 players can play online, and the game does at least include the split-screen four-player multiplayer mode GoldenEye fans were so very fond of.

Ultimately, nothing 007 Legends offers is worth the effort of trudging through it.</p>", "deck": "Bland.

Let it suffice that eight years after release, Doom 3 remains a divisive game. Whether you found the juggling of weapons and flashlight to be a taut tension-builder or a tedious chore, thought the monster closets were chilling or just cheesy, odds are Doom 3 left a deep impression on you. Me, I'm a staunch member of the pro-Doom 3 brigade, and while I haven't thought much about the game since I got done with its only expansion pack ages ago, I realized recently that I've been plenty ready for a good excuse to run back through those dimly lit Martian corridors again with all the hindsight the last several years have provided.</p><p style=\"\">Whichever kind of person you are, the new BFG Edition is probably not the Doom 3 you should hold onto for posterity. Far from the loving tribute to an important milestone in modern games it could have been, BFG only adds a couple of esoteric technical features and a short, mediocre new campaign add-on to Doom 3, at the expense of some of the core graphics and gameplay features that defined the game's identity on its initial release. Even the inclusion of Doom and Doom II isn't handled as elegantly as it should be on either console. If you really want a version of Doom 3 to play on your Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, BFG Edition works, but it's bafflingly far from ideal.</p><p style=\"\">In this package you get regular Doom 3, the expansion Resurrection of Evil (which added some pretty tasty stuff to the original recipe), and that new eight-level campaign dubbed The Lost Mission. The Lost Mission is not the reason to own the BFG Edition. In addition to the ubiquitous monster closets and red-flash teleporter spawns, the two previous games featured just enough custom-designed action moments and unique enemy entrances to keep things entertaining. Hell, Doom 3 was pretty much the first game to have enemies tearing their way through level geometry in the first place. The Lost Mission has none of that. Its levels feel boxier, more generic, one room of enemy spawns after another stitched together in a fairly uninteresting way. There's a shred of boilerplate story with a few minutes of new voiceover and one character who appears briefly, but none of it is engaging. It's also well on the short side, as it took me only around three hours on the hardest difficulty to get through--though, as repetitive as even I found the enemy encounters toward the end, maybe that's a blessing.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2349775-cacodemon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349775\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2349775-cacodemon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349775\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2349775-cacodemon.jpg\"></a><figcaption>No cacodads were harmed in the writing of this review.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Sadly, even the two original games don't arrive intact in BFG, and it's here where I find the changes made to this collection so perplexing and unfortunate. Like it or hate it, your inability to use a flashlight and weapon at the same time was the defining factor in Doom 3's gameplay cycle and it's largely what created the game's thick sense of tension. Sweeping a darkened room with your light would give you a basic sense of its layout, but if you wanted to defend yourself, you had to rely on your memory, the ambient glow of the facility's remaining computers and machinery, and the muzzle flash of your weapons to make out the shapes of the enemies and put your shots on target. BFG Edition throws all that right out the window, making the flashlight a simple toggle that you turn on and off instantly regardless of what weapon you're holding. The flashlight also bafflingly doesn't cast any shadows off the environment, enemies, or anything else, which may sound like an obscure technical thing but was also instrumental in establishing the visual mood of Doom 3. These changes don't <i>destroy</i> the tension--I still let out a couple of involuntary yelps here and there when a maggot snuck up behind me--but why there's not at least a menu option for classic flashlight mode, I have no idea. There are hardly options for anything, even basic functionality like subtitles, and on the PC, where you expect a healthy set of graphics options but will find none, that's especially damning.</p><p style=\"\">You can add the first two Doom games to the list of BFG's features, but these aren't especially well implemented either. On the 360, you're just launching the Xbox Live Arcade releases from a menu, so if you already bought those, you're getting literally nothing new. (The inability to play these releases from the game's custom menu when the disc is installed is just inexcusable, especially when you can still circumvent the issue by playing them from the dashboard's games library.) Things are a bit rosier on the PS3, which has never seen either of these classics released on PSN, but the ports themselves aren't nearly as snappy as the ones on the Xbox, with slow, clunky menus and a lengthy save process every time you change a menu option.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2349778-d31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349778\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2349778-d31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349778\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2349778-d31.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2349778-d31.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>No flashlight, no shadows, no sale.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">So what are the BFG Edition's pros? Stereoscopic 3D support across the board is the one that's likely to be useful to the most people. Obviously, that largely comes down to your interest in playing games in 3D in the first place, but the 3D separation worked more or less fine on both consoles for me. I occasionally ran into enough crosstalk to make it hard to aim at enemies, but that may have been due to my TV setup and not the game. You can definitely lay the 3D frame rate issues at the game's feet though. Both versions run at a rock-solid 60 frames per second in normal mode, but the frame rate drops substantially in 3D (and noticeably worse so on the Xbox), enough that I preferred just playing it in 2D for a smoother experience. The PC version offers support for the forthcoming Oculus Rift VR headset, which is conceptually a great feature to have, but since even the developer-oriented version of that thing isn't shipping yet, it's not very helpful in practice right now. And the presence of a cool feature you can't actually use yet is especially depressing in light of the poor implementation of some of this collection's more basic features.</p><p style=\"\">I had planned to end this review with a recommendation that, if you don't need 3D or Rift support, you just stick with the regular Doom 3, which is highly moddable and which any modern PC will run perfectly fine. But the original game is no longer available for sale on Steam outside of the hundred-dollar id collection, meaning the BFG Edition is the best you're going to do right now if you want to buy a new copy of a shooter that, for better or worse, ranks among the most hyped video game releases of all time.</p>", "deck": "However you felt about Doom 3 when it came out, BFG Edition isn't the best way to play it today.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-535/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-14537/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/doom-3/3030-14537/", "id": 14537, "name": "Doom 3"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-10-22 11:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117538/", "id": 117538, "name": "DOOM 3: BFG Edition"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/medal-of-honor-warfighter-review/1900-536/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229536-427834_373704192670776_1188870294_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229536\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2229536-427834_373704192670776_1188870294_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2229536\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2229536-427834_373704192670776_1188870294_n.jpg\"></a><figcaption>So. Many. Beards.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/medal-of-honor-warfighter/3030-37580/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37580\">Medal of Honor: Warfighter</a> is a modern-military-themed first-person shooter with snap-to aiming, a short, globe-trotting campaign and a level-based multiplayer mode. You're instructed to go \"weapons free\" a lot. I feel compelled to speak about the game as dryly and matter-of-factly as the game seems to regard itself, because if you're reading this review, you're painfully familiar with the sort of game Warfighter is. It does all the things that sort of game is supposed to do, but not with the flair or invention that would make it possible to care again about playing something you remember having played so many times before. In such a crowded and competitive category, there's not much about this game that stands out, and that assumes you're looking for more of this type of thing in the first place. For a lot of people in 2012, that's a big assumption.</p><p style=\"\">Warfighter's campaign gives you five or six hours of flying around the world to shoot at enemies every time they pop out from behind cover, breaking up the bulk of your time in the Middle East with the occasional interlude in places like Somalia and... the Philippines? While there may be legitimate real-world reasons that terrorist cells would be operating in such areas, the way you hop disjointedly from a hostage crisis in one country to a hunt for explosive contraband in another to kidnapping a shifty banker in a third--all largely without context and starring different sets of characters who don't clearly relate to one another--just made me think the game was looking for excuses to make sure not all of your enemies are wearing turbans.</p><p style=\"\">The game admirably makes an attempt to at least humanize one side of the conflict, depicting the American soldiers' families and the effect their duty-bound determination-bordering-on-obsession has on their home lives. But these scenes aren't dramatically interesting in themselves (and plunge deep into the uncanny valley), and they're peppered so haphazardly throughout the already flat story of special-ops intrigue that it all just runs together into so much noise. There are no strong, memorable characters. I wish I'd had an easier time telling Preacher from Stump from Mother from Voodoo from Dusty, but they all look the same and talk the same and act the same to such an extent that at some point it all degenerates into a sea of beards.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2228651-mohwe3screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2228651\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2228651-mohwe3screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2228651\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2228651-mohwe3screen005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's just not much here you haven't seen before.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The campaign is intensely scripted and almost perfectly linear. That's probably not a surprise, but it doesn't make it any less underwhelming that every checkpoint plays out the same no matter how many times you restart it, that you need to do exactly what the game wants you to in every instance in order to trigger the next sequence, that you can never run any direction except forward. Once in a while the scripting breaks, as when the game failed to spawn in two key enemies so I could move forward until they spawned right behind me, or when I tried to stab the wrong enemy in the back during a stilted stealth sequence when I was <i>clearly</i> meant to stab the other guy instead. There aren't many moments when it doesn't work, but all the other moments are just boring, with the exception of the two driving levels. The first, where you chase a car through a crowded third-world marketplace, is simple but actually kind of exhilarating. The second is a stealth driving sequence (yes) that devolves into a vehicular version of <a href=\"/pac-man/3025-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-463\">Pac-Man</a>. The driving and a couple of boilerplate rail-shooting levels don't do much to uplift what is otherwise as standard a shooter campaign as can be.</p><p style=\"\">There is of course also the requisite multiplayer mode, which on the Xbox is split off onto a totally separate disc. As expected, everything you do online feeds into a persistent ranking system, though at least it feels like there are more ways than headshots and a solid KDR to rank up. You're put into a random two-man fireteam in most multiplayer matches, and you can earn a decent amount of unlock points by assisting your buddy with ammo and healing. The fireteam system is handled intelligently in general, allowing you to spawn on your ally in the field and even spawning you in with the same posture he's currently using. Points have a way of piling up further after matches, when various team- and mode-based ribbons unlock based on overall match performance. The game types here all fall into the standard buckets of capture-and-hold, team deathmatch, and so on. If I had to choose a favorite, it'd be combat mission, which tasks you with attacking or defending three points on the map and constrains your team not based on a time limit but a common number of respawns. There's nothing out of the ordinary about the online gameplay, but I'll admit it's still possible to feel that particular last-minute thrill when you barely eke out a win at the end of a taut match.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122165/2351154-moh_warfighter_grenade_indicator_cutscene.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2351154\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"683\" style=\"width: 683px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122165/2351154-moh_warfighter_grenade_indicator_cutscene.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2351154\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122165/2351154-moh_warfighter_grenade_indicator_cutscene.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122165/2351154-moh_warfighter_grenade_indicator_cutscene.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Whoa, buddy. I know she's your ex, but grenades?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Multiplayer features a sprawling array of player unlocks that range from cosmetic stuff like camo to support abilities like mortar strikes and ancillary weapons like grenade launchers. The most impressive part of the whole construction is an extensive weapon-customization system that lets you swap out stocks, muzzles, sights, receivers, and magazines for each individual firearm. Filing all of that under a section labeled \"My Gun\" feels just a bit perverse, though, and you'd have to be <i>really</i> into the gameplay here to spend the time unlocking it all. The game plays well enough when the pressure is on, but the performance isn't nearly as smooth as the annual <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a> offering and there's not nearly as much depth and scale as <a href=\"/battlefield-3/3030-27006/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27006\">Battlefield</a>. So there's not much here to explicitly recommend over the competition.</p><p style=\"\">Warfighter has no real reason to exist, but it's not surprising that it does exist. The last Medal of Honor did surprisingly well in the marketplace, and Battlefield 3 must have sold significantly better. So I suppose you can't fault a publicly traded company for taking its annual stab at cashing in on the military-shooter craze that still inexplicably shows no signs of abating. If we're going to get so many of these games, though, it's a shame a few of them don't aim higher than a mark that's been squarely hit so many times before.</p>", "deck": "Warfighter makes no successful effort to stand out in a very crowded genre.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-536/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-37580/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/medal-of-honor-warfighter/3030-37580/", "id": 37580, "name": "Medal of Honor: Warfighter"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-10-27 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115656/", "id": 115656, "name": "Medal of Honor: Warfighter"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/need-for-speed-most-wanted-review/1900-537/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2230143-461503_403039866403875_393538555_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2230143\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5822102425876\" data-width=\"1855\" style=\"width: 1855px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2230143-461503_403039866403875_393538555_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2230143\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2230143-461503_403039866403875_393538555_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The cops are probably the least interesting part about Most Wanted.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/need-for-speed-most-wanted/3030-38497/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38497\">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</a> might not have the name on the box, but it's essentially a mini-sequel to <a href=\"/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5648\">Burnout Paradise</a>. <a href=\"/criterion-games/3010-315/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-315\">Criterion</a> has taken a lot of the ideas from its last big open-world racing game and sharpened them up a bit. As the type of person who put hundreds of hours into Burnout Paradise, I find this to be a very exciting prospect, indeed. While the ideas behind Most Wanted are mostly sound, sometimes the execution of its solo gameplay is decidedly less so. Yet the multiplayer side takes all those learnings from Burnout Paradise and runs with them in some incredible ways. The end result is a game with some amazing moments and enough little issues to make you constantly wish that it was slightly better, slightly smoother, and (on consoles) slightly cleaner.</p><p style=\"\">But let's start with what Most Wanted actually is. It's an open world racing game with a single-player mode that is very different from its multiplayer, but they're united by a shared player progression. In single-player mode, the object is to take on the 10 cars that make up the \"Most Wanted List.\" In order to unlock those 10 races, you'll need to earn <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a>, which are gained in other races. With the exception of the \"Most Wanted\" cars themselves, no vehicles are doled out to you as you progress. Instead, every car is tucked away in a few spots around the world. These \"jack spots\" let you drive up to these parked cars and press a button to switch. Each car has five races assigned to it, and completing these earn you experience points and unlock car modifiers, like off-road tires that help you maintain control when you're not on the streets, or a reinforced chassis that lets you maintain control after a collision with another racer or cop. That's not to say that there are five <i>unique</i> races for every car, though, as plenty of them repeat. But the unlocks are car-specific, so if you're bent on doing everything you'll need to find every car and complete all five races with every car.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2230148-603041_403040093070519_2081494442_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2230148\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"720\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2230148-603041_403040093070519_2081494442_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2230148\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2230148-603041_403040093070519_2081494442_n.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Putting the aero body on your car lets you catch more air, useful for taking some high scores.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The cars themselves handle well in a loose, fun way that feels a lot like Burnout Paradise. Tapping the brakes sets your car adrift, letting you get long, smooth slides around sharp corners, often while simultaneously using your nitrous boost to actually gain speed while sliding out. The fastest cars require tight turning abilities and even tighter reaction times from the player to help dodge oncoming traffic, highway dividers, and the like. Once you get used to its specific style of driving, it's positively excellent.</p><p style=\"\">While the bulk of the single-player events are only open to a few cars, the Most Wanted races themselves are open to any vehicle, and you can use a handy in-game menu to change cars or mods at any time. But, for whatever reason, changing cars doesn't let you change cars on the spot. You can only warp to one of the areas where that car is parked. So changing cars on the fly isn't really an option, which is annoying in cases where you want to switch to a faster car because you just found a billboard, speed camera, or some other optional piece of the world that you want to blast through.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The name Most Wanted also implies that the police will be involved, and sure enough, they'll pop up with increasing frequency as you work your way through the game. Some events simply have police encounters programmed into them, forcing you to deal with the law as you race and escape them once the race is complete. You can also get into free-drive scuffles with the law if they see you driving fast... which happens all the time. The police aspect of Most Wanted feels tossed in and largely out of place, especially when you're just trying to bang out some races and unlock mods for your current car. You can't start race events or warp to other cars while a pursuit is in progress. While you can typically speed away from a pursuit just as it's started and get away without much trouble, if you get mired in a longer chase that started during a previous event, the fastest way out is usually to just let yourself get caught. There's no penalty for that--in fact there are in-game milestones built upon getting busted--though the game forcibly warps you back to your current car's parking spot once that happens. If you're right near the next event or trying to hunt down collectibles, this is pretty much just a pain in the ass.</p><p style=\"\">Ultimately, though, the real issue with the single-player is that it feels a little empty. The world feels small and lifeless. Aside from an announcer coming on and giving a speech that is deliberately similar to the one found in Burnout Paradise when you first start playing, the only other chatter you hear comes during police chases. But the police radio dialogue is almost immediately repetitive, adding the tedium I felt whenever the law got involved. On top of that, it isn't particularly long or in-depth, so unless you're bent on upgrading every car, you'll reach a million experience points and be able to complete the final Most Wanted race in around six or seven hours.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227099-007124.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227099\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227099-007124.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227099\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227099-007124.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227099-007124.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Though you'll see plenty of cops during some pursuits, it never turns into the Blues Brothers or anything like that.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Thankfully, the game has multiplayer, and the online side of Need for Speed: Most Wanted is <i>amazing</i>. Rather than just dump you into yet another series of races, Most Wanted is more like the challenge modes found in Burnout Paradise with some proper racing mixed in. The events join together to form \"speedlists,\" which group five different events together. These are served up at random in public matches, but you can configure your own lists for private matches. The events vary from group activities, like asking all the players to perform drifts around a landmark until the total drift yardage reaches a certain number. Or individual feats of skill, like seeing who can get the longest jump off of a specific ramp. But these have a twist. If you're taken out by another player while trying to hit that longest jump, your last score is frozen and you're effectively eliminated from the event, leaving you to just try to screw it up for the other players by taking them out. So it's a viable strategy to get a good, long jump and then just park on the ramp to mess up other players. It's <i>dirty</i>.</p><p style=\"\">Even the racing has a wicked, filthy edge to it. Between events, you're asked to drive to the next meet up spot so that all players are in the same basic location when the next event starts. When that event is a race, it doesn't line you all up into some sort of formal starting grid. As soon as the GPS line appears on your map and you know which direction you're supposed to take, you're free to start moving in the basic direction of the first checkpoint, timer be damned. Even the drive to the meet up point has a bit of competition to it, as the player that gets there first gets a little bit of XP. At the end of the five-event group, the scores are tallied, a winner is declared, and you're ready for the next set.</p><p style=\"\">Though the pool of experience points you earn is used across multiplayer and the solo portion of Most Wanted, the two sides of the game handle unlocks completely differently. Rather than finding cars in the world, in multiplayer you unlock more cars when you gain a level, and mods for those cars are earned by driving and performing well in those specific vehicles. So you might earn track tires for driving a car for five miles or an aero body kit for jumping a set number of yards. \"Pro\" versions of these perks are also unlockable later on. And since the game uses the same XP count for both modes, playing online is a good way to unlock the Most Wanted races in single-player, and if you've been playing a bunch of single-player, you'll have a bunch of new cars to choose from the next time you get in a game with other people.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227100-007119.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227100\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227100-007119.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227100\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227100-007119.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227100-007119.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>No front plate, but your rear license plate is customizable like a Call of Duty playercard.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The Xbox 360 version of the game is a little hitchy, with an unstable frame rate that takes supreme dives whenever there are a lot of cop cars on-screen. It also looks a little blurry at the horizon, which in a game where dodging oncoming traffic at insane speeds is the order of the day can cause some issues of its own. The PC version, predictably, has none of these issues. It looks great at high resolutions and, assuming you've got a machine that can handle it, the frame rate is terrific. Ultimately, though, this is a multiplayer game that you'll enjoy most with friends, and you should probably play it where your friends will play it... just try to convince them all that the PC version is the way to go, if you hold that sort of sway over your peers.</p><p style=\"\">It's also worth noting that Most Wanted might be the first game I've seen that justifies the existence of EA's <a href=\"/origin/3015-7040/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7040\">Origin</a> service, as it syncs your point total across all platforms, including the <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">Vita</a> version. This means that if you finish the game on one platform, you'll have enough points to immediately open the main races in single-player on another platform, but more importantly your multiplayer progress will carry over. I don't know that I'd recommend that people play the game on multiple platforms, but if you're planning on playing the portable version as well as its \"big\" counterpart, it's pretty cool to not have to unlock all those cars in both places.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame that the single-player portion of Most Wanted isn't more exciting, but it's still pretty good because the handling makes the cars enjoyable to just drive around, regardless of what you're doing. But if you're looking for a solid, lengthy solo campaign from a driving game, this isn't what you're looking for. Most Wanted is a multiplayer-first game, and taken in that context, few games do it better than this.</p>", "deck": "If you're looking for a multiplayer driving game that's about way more than simple races, Most Wanted's speedlist system makes for an amazingly good time.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-537/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38497/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/need-for-speed-most-wanted/3030-38497/", "id": 38497, "name": "Need for Speed: Most Wanted"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-10-30 06:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117691/", "id": 117691, "name": "Need for Speed: Most Wanted"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wwe-13-review/1900-538/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Professional wrestling in 2012 is largely terrible. Granted, I say this as someone who experienced wrestling's most recent \"glory days,\" namely the period between 1996 and the early 2000s when the (then) <a data-ref-id=\"3025-130\" href=\"/wwe/3025-130/\" slug=\"wwe\">WWF</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-216\" href=\"/wcw/3025-216/\" slug=\"wcw\">WCW</a> were locked in an embittered battle over who could produce the most entertaining Monday night multihour block of guys in tights pretending to angry hug one another. In WWE terms, this was the \"Attitude Era,\" the period when stars like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-581\" href=\"/steve-austin/3005-581/\" slug=\"steve-austin\">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1674\" href=\"/the-rock/3005-1674/\" slug=\"the-rock\">The Rock</a>, and D-Generation X captured the imaginations of wrestling fans anew, and made \"sports entertainment\" a legitimate billion dollar business. I look at what wrestling was then, and compare it against what wrestling is now, and objectively, I feel that I can say that wrestling just ain't what it used to be.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2277178-off_cell_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2277178\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2277178-off_cell_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2277178\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/2277178-off_cell_3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>WWE '13 pays homage to the glory days of the WWE, while also improving its many modern accouterments.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">And yet, sometimes I forget that many younger wrestling fans either were too young, or simply not around during these times. All they know is the modern wrestling era. They know that people like The Rock and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-574\" href=\"/mick-foley/3005-574/\" slug=\"mick-foley\">Mick Foley</a> are big time guys from a bygone era, but outside of some DVDs and recaps, it's likely they've never had the experience of seeing this stuff in detail. This is one of the many things that makes <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38395\" href=\"/wwe-13/3030-38395/\" slug=\"wwe-13\">WWE '13</a> such a surprising delight. The producers at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" slug=\"thq\">THQ</a> have dedicated this year's wrestling video game to the Attitude of yesteryear, building a whole story mode around the history of superstars like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-597\" href=\"/shawn-michaels/3005-597/\" slug=\"shawn-michaels\">Shawn Michaels</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4841\" href=\"/bret-hart/3005-4841/\" slug=\"bret-hart\">Bret Hart</a>, Stone Cold, The Rock, and many more. Even more amazing is that it's actually great. In improving a variety of things introduced for the first time in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35483\" href=\"/wwe-12/3030-35483/\" slug=\"wwe-12\">WWE '12</a>, WWE '13 is by far the most playable WWE video game in ages. That playability helps elevate WWE '13's Attitude Era leanings into something more than just a nifty history lesson. In fact, it's probably the best storytelling a WWE video game has featured in as far back as I can remember.</p><p style=\"\">Sure, it helps that THQ is straight up lifting great stories and matches from the Attitude Era, but in WWE '13, it's more about the way they're presented that makes the whole thing work so well. Each section of the Attitude Era mode is broken out by superstar(s). DX, Stone Cold, The Rock, the Brothers of Destruction, and Mankind all have their own chapter sections, which lead into a culmination in the weeks leading up to Wrestlemania XV. Each match you play represents a significant historical moment for that superstar. Remember when <a data-ref-id=\"3005-469\" href=\"/triple-h/3005-469/\" slug=\"triple-h\">Hunter Hearst Helmsley</a> first teamed up with Shawn Michaels on RAW in 1997 to form DX? Or how about the debut of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-572\" href=\"/kane/3005-572/\" slug=\"kane\">Kane</a> at Badd Blood that same year? Even if you don't, the story mode does a great job of setting up each match and related storyline with both text and video footage edited together by the WWE's own in-house video team. It's simultaneously educational and entertaining stuff.</p><p style=\"\">The matches themselves are fun too, thanks in no small part to the ditching of last year's idiotic \"press button to win\" story mode finishes. Instead, this year's game introduces historical objectives both optional and mandatory. Most times, the mandatory ones simply involve winning a match a certain way, but other objectives can be far more specific. In the legendary Hell in a Cell match between <a data-ref-id=\"3005-473\" href=\"/the-undertaker/3005-473/\" slug=\"the-undertaker\">Undertaker</a> and Mankind, you are set up ahead of time to relive that match's most brutal moments. You will throw Mankind off the top of that cage, through the announce table, and down to the ring. In very specific moments where the original match featured scenarios not playable in the game engine, the game will cut away to a pre-rendered scene, but it's all done in-engine, and is surprisingly seamless. If anything, I was surprised by how much the game asked me to do. It's one thing to play the infamous \"Montreal Screwjob\" match between Michaels and Hart, and it's quite another to actually be able to put Hart in the Sharpshooter, and have a digitized <a data-ref-id=\"3005-471\" href=\"/vince-mcmahon/3005-471/\" slug=\"vince-mcmahon\">Vince McMahon</a> run out and preemptively call for the bell. Honestly, the only thing missing was Earl Hebner.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2277172-broken_ring_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2277172\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2277172-broken_ring_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2277172\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/2277172-broken_ring_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>While the OMG! moments have kind of a stupid name, they're unquestionably awesome.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All the arenas, fonts, and other related aesthetics are here, along with a couple dozen Attitude era superstars, from the big guys, all the way down to more minor players like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-586\" href=\"/sean-waltman/3005-586/\" slug=\"sean-waltman\">X-Pac</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-569\" href=\"/the-godfather/3005-569/\" slug=\"the-godfather\">The Godfather</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9311\" href=\"/the-british-bulldog/3005-9311/\" slug=\"the-british-bulldog\">British Bulldog</a>. It's not all-encompassing, as certain era-relevant superstars like the Hardy Boyz, the Dudley Boys, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-557\" href=\"/al-snow/3005-557/\" slug=\"al-snow\">Al Snow</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-570\" href=\"/hardcore-holly/3005-570/\" slug=\"hardcore-holly\">Hardcore Holly</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-582\" href=\"/steve-blackman/3005-582/\" slug=\"steve-blackman\">Steve Blackman</a> aren't around. And I do wish THQ had found a way to clear roster spots currently held by era-specific versions of superstars already in the game--honestly, does anyone really need <i>one</i> version of Triple H, let alone three?--but beyond that, the roster is hard to argue with.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, nearly all the current WWE superstars are on-hand as well. The most interesting thing to me about having the dual rosters is how striking the difference is between them. Looking at the Attitude era, you've got these insane, cartoonish personalities that evoke their larger-than-life personas. And while I love current guys like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-614\" href=\"/cm-punk/3005-614/\" slug=\"cm-punk\">CM Punk</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-19968\" href=\"/daniel-bryan/3005-19968/\" slug=\"daniel-bryan\">Daniel Bryan</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12872\" href=\"/cody-rhodes/3005-12872/\" slug=\"cody-rhodes\">Cody Rhodes</a>, it's incredibly telling that the modern roster essentially blends into a blur of random dudes when held against the Attitude era roster. That's hardly THQ's fault, but it is something I found myself noticing more and more as I played.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">And while paid DLC is not something I often take pleasure in mentioning, I have to say that this is the first year THQ has ever actually had me excited about DLC in a wrestling game. The main roster itself is actually shockingly up-to-date, given how often these games seem to be a year behind the actual on-TV product. But there are some recent additions--like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24199\" href=\"/damien-sandow/3005-24199/\" slug=\"damien-sandow\">Damien Sandow</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24530\" href=\"/antonio-cesaro/3005-24530/\" slug=\"antonio-cesaro\">Antonio Cesaro</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24198\" href=\"/aj/3005-24198/\" slug=\"aj\">AJ Lee</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24524\" href=\"/ryback/3005-24524/\" slug=\"ryback\">Ryback</a>--that are missing. They are currently scheduled to be released as DLC, along with a host of classic Attitude Era favorites like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-585\" href=\"/val-venis/3005-585/\" slug=\"val-venis\">Val Venis</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-19140\" href=\"/rikishi/3005-19140/\" slug=\"rikishi\">Rikishi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-568\" href=\"/gangrel/3005-568/\" slug=\"gangrel\">Gangrel</a>, and even the Loose Cannon <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24529\" href=\"/brian-pillman/3005-24529/\" slug=\"brian-pillman\">Brian Pillman</a>. It seems like THQ has finally figured out how to effectively keep up with TV wrestling, and that's pretty awesome.</p><p style=\"\">For as great as all these bells and whistles are, none of it would matter if the in-ring action were no good. Last year's WWE '12 put this series on a positive gameplay path for the first time in ages. Despite some rickety parts, it played surprisingly well. WWE '13 builds on the ideas laid down last year and refines them. The core grappling and striking systems are the same, but the pacing, reversal timing, and overall \"feel\" of the matches is pretty great. Little additions, like OMG! moments (where, with a stored finisher, you can do things like knock an opponent through the guard rail, or collapse the ring when superplexing one of the game's larger wrestlers), and being able to reverse attacks into finishers (much as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-602\" href=\"/randy-orton/3005-602/\" slug=\"randy-orton\">Randy Orton</a> tends to do with the RKO), are a big plus. Momentum swings and big time comebacks inherent to professional wrestling are well represented here, and the in-game animations have continued to improve. Stiffness and wonkiness with wrestlers not connecting properly has definitely been lessened, though it's not gone altogether. You'll still see some weird physics glitches once in a while, and I still think the grappling engine is a bit over-reliant on reversals, but by and large, playing WWE '13 is actually quite enjoyable.</p><p style=\"\">It helps that the developers finally figured out a way to drastically improve the in-match presentation. Is commentary still kind of a mess? In spots, yes, though during the Attitude Era mode, you're at least transported back in time courtesy of commentary from good ol' <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89857\" href=\"/jim-ross/3040-89857/\" slug=\"jim-ross\">Jim Ross</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-18607\" href=\"/jerry-lawler/3005-18607/\" slug=\"jerry-lawler\">The King</a>. In fact, some of the story matches feature commentary audio from the original matches, which is a nice touch. Even better than those changes, however, are the changes made to crowd noise. Undoubtedly, wrestling is always better when set against the backdrop of a hot crowd. Seeing people go apeshit over a Stone Cold Stunner or People's Elbow is arguably half of what made the Attitude Era so fun to watch. THQ has addressed this in kind, ramping up the crowd audio to a fevered, ravenous pitch when matches begin swinging the hero's way. It's not always the most natural progression--sometimes the audio goes from crazy to dead quiet out of nowhere--and occasionally crowd noise will drown out Attitude Era commentary bits. But when it works correctly, matches have never felt more energetic.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137457/2219582-screenlg4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2219582\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137457/2219582-screenlg4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2219582\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137457/2219582-screenlg4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137457/2219582-screenlg4.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It doesn't matter if your wrestling preferences skew old or new: WWE '13 has a little something for everyone.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This leads us to the remaining chunks of content in WWE '13, namely the holdover stuff from years past. Universe mode is much as it's always been, albeit with a few more tweaks in its randomly generated storylines to give players more control over what happens show-to-show. I still think it's better to use the story editor to create your own storylines, especially given the sheer volume of available story tweaks available. The usual create-a-wrestler/entrance/move-set/finisher/arena/logo/highlight reel modes are all still around, as well as a highly limited create-a-title mode. All this stuff is as good as it's ever been, of course. It'd be nice if next year we got some fixes for some of the lingering jankiness in the create modes, but even with occasional hiccups, it's hard to hate what's on offer here.</p><p style=\"\">The last remaining elephant in the room would be WWE '13's online servers. While matches were playable last year, lag kept popping up in weird intervals, and for long periods of time, the servers simply refused to connect matches, or let players download user-created content. This year, those issues largely seem gone. I've been able to download content without any hassle, and the matches I've tried to connect to have worked nine times out of 10. We'll see if the servers hold up under the weight of a full player base, but right now, everything appears good to go.</p><p style=\"\">While it might sound counter-intuitive for a game to look to the past to move forward, that's precisely what WWE '13 does. It's not so much about the roster as it is about the reverence it pays to the Attitude Era throughout its various modes and features. WWE '13 remembers when wrestling, and by proxy, wrestling video games were great. It remembers the pageantry, the silliness, and the death-defying stunts that made wrestling such a hot commodity a decade ago. Modern fans will still get the wrestlers and features they've grown accustomed to, while also getting a taste of what wrestling's past brought to the table. Nostalgists will have close to a dozen hours worth of matches and stories from one of the WWE's greatest eras to play through. It's been a long time since I've been able to earnestly recommend a wrestling game to just about any type of fan, but WWE '13 is most definitely worth such a recommendation.</p>", "deck": "By looking backward, WWE '13 pushes this franchise forward in a shockingly positive way.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-538/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38395/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wwe-13/3030-38395/", "id": 38395, "name": "WWE '13"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-10-30 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-120612/", "id": 120612, "name": "WWE '13"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/halo-4-review/1900-539/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343710\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343710\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343710-f6p8e.png\"></a><figcaption>Armor customization is merely cosmetic, but there are some cool helmets and stuff to unlock.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Did the new team at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6753\" href=\"/343-industries/3010-6753/\" slug=\"343-industries\">343 Industries</a> break <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2\" href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" slug=\"halo\">Halo</a>? No, not at all. Taking over the franchise from its creators at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-476\" href=\"/bungie/3010-476/\" slug=\"bungie\">Bungie</a> and creating a new, numbered sequel starring the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-175\" href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" slug=\"master-chief\">Master Chief</a> seems like the sort of daunting task that could have blown up the entire franchise if it had gone poorly. But the developers have executed quite well, developing a Halo game that gets that Halo feel down nicely while also playing around with the periphery of the experience in an attempt to modernize things a bit. Some of those new ideas work better than others, but if there's any actual issue with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35533\" href=\"/halo-4/3030-35533/\" slug=\"halo-4\">Halo 4</a> it's that the game plays it a little too safe. Master Chief starts the game surrounded by mystery, but it relies too heavily on the use of existing enemies and weapons, and by the end of the campaign it sort of feels like the Master Chief is right back in the middle of the same conflict and theater of war he seemingly left behind at the end of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\" href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" slug=\"halo-3\">Halo 3</a>.</p><p style=\"\">The action opens with the Master Chief being woken out of his stasis only to find danger. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-81\" href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" slug=\"the-covenant\">Covenant</a> forces have boarded his ripped-up ship and this whole mess is headed for a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-80\" href=\"/the-forerunner/3015-80/\" slug=\"the-forerunner\">Forerunner</a> planet called <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2921\" href=\"/requiem/3035-2921/\" slug=\"requiem\">Requiem</a>. Before too long a human ship called the Infinity joins the fray, giving you the standard factions of a Halo game. Mixed into this conflict is a new batch of enemies called the Prometheans. And tying it all together is a central bad guy known as the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-24550\" href=\"/the-didact/3005-24550/\" slug=\"the-didact\">Didact</a>. The story starts to head in some interesting directions. Your ever-present AI pal <a data-ref-id=\"3005-315\" href=\"/cortana/3005-315/\" slug=\"cortana\">Cortana</a>, for example, is falling apart due to being \"alive\" for more than seven years. As she breaks down, it's harder for her to maintain focus and help the Chief complete his tasks. It's also really interesting to put a face to the antagonists in a Halo game, rather than larger species or concepts like \"the Covenant.\" That said, however, you sure do spend a lot of time fighting old enemies.</p><p style=\"\">The most dramatic change you'll see on the enemy front is a floating <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7473\" href=\"/promethean-watchers/3015-7473/\" slug=\"promethean-watchers\">Promethean Watcher</a> that hovers above its allies, emitting beams that shield the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7474\" href=\"/promethean-knights/3015-7474/\" slug=\"promethean-knights\">Knights</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7472\" href=\"/promethean-crawlers/3015-7472/\" slug=\"promethean-crawlers\">Crawlers</a> below. It'll also snatch any grenades you toss in their direction and fling it right back in your direction, which is sort of a jerk move if you ask me.

In short, shoot the Watchers first. The other Promethean enemies aren't dramatically different from the types of enemies you've been facing in previous games. Crawlers can crawl down from the walls and the bipedal Knights can teleport, allowing them to warp away from the business end of your battle rifle and reappear behind you.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2336139-8042883187_6c906d15eb_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336139\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2336139-8042883187_6c906d15eb_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336139\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2336139-8042883187_6c906d15eb_b.jpg\"></a><figcaption>These mechs pop up in multiplayer and campaign.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But you'll also face a <i>lot</i> of Covenant opposition, including <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1331\" href=\"/grunts/3015-1331/\" slug=\"grunts\">Grunts</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-470\" href=\"/elites/3015-470/\" slug=\"elites\">Elites</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3379\" href=\"/jackals/3015-3379/\" slug=\"jackals\">Jackals</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3376\" href=\"/hunters/3015-3376/\" slug=\"hunters\">Hunters</a>. Fighting these guys feels the same way it always has, for better or worse. The Grunts are total chumps, the Elites are fun to bash in the face, the Jackals are never left-handed, and the Hunters are large and slow. As before, the game mixes up your various enemies to serve them up in different configurations. On the normal difficulty, this doesn't make much difference, as you can just plow through the opposition the way a big, armored dude like the Master Chief should. On higher settings, the action gets a little more tactical, forcing you to poke out, do some damage, and hang back to let your shields recharge. Again, this shouldn't sound like much of a surprise to people who have played a Halo game before, but it's just another example of the ways that this new development team made a game that feels very similar to Bungie's work on the previous games. That said, the promise of landing on a new planet and the potential for new experiences and encounters that the change of setting could have allowed for makes the notion of spending what feels like most of the game fighting enemies from old Halo games a little unfortunate.</p><p style=\"\">You'll pick up some new weapons along the way, and the Chief himself has been given some additional abilities. Most of the new weapons drop from the new Promethean enemies. They look great, and the first time you pick one up you'll see it sort of form together into a gun. It's a nice introductory animation that, thankfully, doesn't play out every time you pick up a weapon. While the new weapons look nice, most of them just plug right into the existing Halo archetypes. You'll see a shotgun, a pistol, a fully-automatic rifle, a single-shot rifle that fires three slugs at once (though one sniper-like megaslug if you're zoomed in), a new grenade type, and so on. The new weapons are disappointing for that reason. They don't feel like they fill any real need or plug into any gaps in the existing Halo arsenal. They're just more ways to do the same thing. The game also offers you the chance to pilot a large mech suit in a couple of spots, but taking a large, slow-moving armored guy like the Master Chief and slapping another larger, slower layer of armor around him for a couple of shooting gallery-like sequences isn't exactly my idea of a good time.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Thankfully, the Chief has some more movement options to keep the game running at a solid pace. You can sprint at will now by clicking in the left stick. This does a lot to speed up the pace of the game, as you might expect. But in addition to that, there's also an equipment slot that lets you use armor abilities, similar to the style of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26786\" href=\"/halo-reach/3030-26786/\" slug=\"halo-reach\">Halo: Reach</a>. These include things like Promethean Vision, which lets you see through walls, or Active Camouflage, which gives you a <i><a data-ref-id=\"3015-4507\" href=\"/predator/3015-4507/\" slug=\"predator\">Predator</a></i>-style invisibility that the AI seems to be able to see right through most of the time. You can also equip abilities that let you deploy auto-sentries, use a large shield, and so on. Being able to sprint without having to equip that as your armor ability is terrific.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343720-rwjav.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343720\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343720-rwjav.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343720\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343720-rwjav.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343720-rwjav.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>This shield is one of the armor abilities you can equip.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Overall, the Halo 4 campaign is pretty good. It looks fantastic in some spots and it takes you to a lot of different-looking places along the way. It sets up a few story elements that won't pay off until later on in this new trilogy of games, but a lot of the story plays things very safe. At the opening of the game it feels like Master Chief and Cortana could be set off onto some great new mystery in a mysterious place where everything could be different. Instead you spend a lot of time fighting old Halo enemies and, by the conclusion of Halo 4's story, I felt like much of the promise inherent to this potentially new setting had been squandered. Maybe that's on me for wanting Halo to be something other than Halo, but without getting into the specifics of the characters and their fates, where things are left at the end of the game feels like a stopping point that sets you up for more of the same enemies and settings in the future.</p><p style=\"\">The multiplayer side of Halo 4 brings in those new weapons and movement changes, so you can sprint there, as well. There are also additional armor abilities to play with and, overall, it feels like the team sat down with a recent Call of Duty game and found ways to plug some of those concepts into Halo. Some of them are cosmetic. Any points you earn during a match pop up right in the center of the screen. When you die, you get a killcam feed of the person that took you out. But some of them are more dramatic, like more customizable loadouts that let you pick your primary and secondary weapons, a starting grenade type, and a few perks, like shields that recharge more quickly, infinite sprint, the ability to scavenge grenades from fallen Spartans, and so on. As you play, you'll earn experience points that give you unlock points, but some items also have a level requirement before they can even be unlocked. So you'll have to play for a bit before you can start out with plasma grenades, and you'll have to play a little longer before you can equip things in all of your perk slots. Halo has done loadouts before, but this is a deeper, and ultimately, more interesting set of options. As before, you'll also unlock various armor pieces as you play, gain levels, or complete challenges. New helmets, shoulders, chest pieces, and so on are also available for you to play around with.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343719-r13qm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343719\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343719-r13qm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343719\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343719-r13qm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343719-r13qm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>These portals teleport you around the planet in the campaign.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The modes you'll play when playing with the public are your typical sort of Halo modes, but with some changes here and there. Team Slayer (as well as some of the other modes) now allows you to call in ordnance after a set number of kills. Don't start freaking out, you're not calling in air strikes or UAVs or anything that dramatic. And it doesn't require you to earn all those kills in a streak. But when you fill an on-screen meter, it gives you the option to call in one of three different things. They might be weapons, like the SAW, a very rugged light machine gun. Or you might have the option to get an overshield, a temporary speed or damage boost, and so on. One time I got the gravity hammer, but was immediately killed before I got to run around and smash people with it. It's a cool little addition. Other modes include Regicide, which is a standard deathmatch mode but the lead player gets marked by an on-screen indicator and also has an additional bounty on his head. Killing the king gets you that bounty, but doesn't automatically make you the king--you need to be in the lead to wear the crown.</p><p style=\"\">You can also get in and build your own custom matches with a variety of rules settings, and the Forge mode that allows you to alter the placement of items in the multiplayer maps (along with a set of Forge-only maps) also returns with some additional options, like the ability to fuse items together. And, as before, you can take your custom games, screenshots, and so on and share them with other players.</p><p style=\"\">There's no wave-based survival mode in Halo 4. In addition to the campaign, the game also has a cooperative mode called Spartan Ops. This is an episodic series that follows a team of Spartans that work out of the Infinity, a large ship that shows up in the campaign. These episodes are going to be released for free on a regular basis as downloadable updates and will contain video clips that help set them up. The first such episode is included alongside the launching game, and as such that's the only one I can really review at this point. The story opens with a video showing Spartans reporting for duty on-board the Infinity. From there, you're tossed into a set of five missions. The locations are ripped from other parts of the game and are extremely combat heavy. And once you're past that initial cutscene, any additional dialogue is delivered via radio chatter. If you're into the combat of Halo and like playing with others against occasionally overwhelming batches of enemies, the missions are passable. But don't go in thinking that this is some sort of elaborate and unique segment of the game that's going to give you a campaign-level experience. It's a set of co-op missions with a loose story wrapper around it, nothing more, nothing less. You can bring in your custom Spartan from the other multiplayer modes and earn experience points by playing Spartan Ops, and there are mode-specific challenges to complete here, as well.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343718-qolyf.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343718\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2343718-qolyf.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2343718\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343718-qolyf.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2343718-qolyf.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shoot the flying dudes first.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The presentation end of Halo 4 is quite nice. The music is outstanding, breaking away from the franchise's past a bit by updating the sound and getting away from some of the overt monk chanting that one still tends to associate with Halo. It helps make Halo 4 sound like its own thing, and that goes a long way. Visually, Halo 4 has some terrific moments that really stand out, but it also holds up well on the technical end with a good frame rate, great lighting, and, for the most part, sharp texture quality. Again, these things help to make Halo 4 look and feel different from its predecessors, probably more than the gameplay does.</p><p style=\"\">From the moment I saw Master Chief put himself back to sleep at the end of Halo 3, all I could think about was how his next adventure--if he would even <i>have</i> a next adventure--should be something dramatically different from the adventures we had already seen. Moving him out into the middle of nowhere and cutting him off from his allies is an idea with huge potential. So that's why I find the storytelling side of Halo 4 to be fairly disappointing. Within the first few hours you've fought enemies that go all the way back to the first game in the franchise and you've reconnected with the human race. That's not to say that the entire story is a bust--and it does set up some potentially interesting things for the next couple of games to address--but it's good that the developers have backed this story up with sharp, time-tested gameplay that gets enhanced in meaningful ways across all modes.</p>", "deck": "The new developers behind the Halo franchise successfully emulate the style of their predecessors as a new trilogy begins with Halo 4.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-539/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35533/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/halo-4/3030-35533/", "id": 35533, "name": "Halo 4"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-11-01 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-111447/", "id": 111447, "name": "Halo 4"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/assassins-creed-iii-liberation-review/1900-540/", "description": "<p style=\"\">If the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-129\" href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" slug=\"playstation-vita\">PlayStation Vita</a> does not develop into a successful handheld platform, then one need only look to a game like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38507\" href=\"/assassins-creed-iii-liberation/3030-38507/\" slug=\"assassins-creed-iii-liberation\">Assassin's Creed III: Liberation</a> to understand why.

While some details about Aveline's life and history are touched upon, many seemingly important details remain unclear. This is partly due to the game's story framing device, namely that the simulation you are experiencing has nothing to do with the continuing adventures of series protagonist <a data-ref-id=\"3005-305\" href=\"/desmond-miles/3005-305/\" slug=\"desmond-miles\">Desmond</a>, but rather is created as part of a program from evil corporation <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2653\" href=\"/abstergo-industries/3015-2653/\" slug=\"abstergo-industries\">Abstergo</a>.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">An unreliable narration device sounds like kind of a neat idea, but it's not constructed well here.

A subplot involving a hacker pops in later in the game, wherein he begins offering you \"the truth\" in the form of some lengthy cutscenes, but actually finding that guy and getting access to those scenes is arguably a lot more of a pain than it ought to have been.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2331980-acl_hd_persona_avelineservant_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2331980\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"2880\" style=\"width: 2880px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2331980-acl_hd_persona_avelineservant_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2331980\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2331980-acl_hd_persona_avelineservant_screenshot.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Combat works best in the more open areas, where the camera can move more freely.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Because of this, Liberation's story never fully coheres. Which is a shame, because Aveline is an incredibly interesting character. Her back story alone is enough to pique a player's interest, but so little of it is properly addressed that I found myself less and less engaged with the story as it plodded along. Aveline's sensitive role within the hot-button racial issues of the time is fascinating, but without a strong, coherent narrative, much of that potential is wasted.</p><p style=\"\">Similar issues plague the gameplay. While there is no mistaking Liberation for anything other than an Assassin's Creed game, some of those hallmark gameplay elements don't quite work as well as they should. Combat remains fluid, but enemies are often pretty brain dead. The game attempts to counterbalance this by forcing you into more required stealth sequences than in other recent franchise entries. Fortunately, the stealth functionality works well. I only ran into a few weird spots where I found it incredibly difficult to stay hidden, or otherwise keeping enemies unaware of my presence. Then again, they're not very smart to begin with, and sneaking up on them rarely requires much effort. I must have pickpocketed a dozen enemies while they were literally staring in my direction.</p><p style=\"\">Still, traversing Liberation's lavishly recreated New Orleans can be a lot of fun. The controls for jumping, swinging, and climbing around the game's scenery are responsive and intuitive, and the city just looks flat-out great. Streets and corridors might be a bit narrower than what you're used to in this series, which sometimes can make fights against soldiers a bit of a pain (mostly due to camera placement), but I never felt anything but joy darting around the city like a bad ass assassin.</p><p style=\"\">It's strange, then, that whole sections of Liberation either take the focus away from that, or flat-out don't let you do it. Mostly this comes into play when engaging one of Aveline's different \"personas.\" Apart from her assassin gear, Aveline can also don a slave costume, which lets her blend in with workers and even incite riots among the people. That persona proves to be less of an issue than the \"lady\" persona, where Aveline loses all ability to jump and traverse in favor of being able to charm and bribe guards. While this is okay in small doses, the game has a tendency to force you into specific personas for longer periods of time than you'd like, especially early on. You're given more freedom later, but it's still a drag to have to gingerly jog around the world to get back to a costume-change area when you know you could just be jumping over a goddamn rooftop.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/24403/2357869-2012_10_31_181816.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357869\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/24403/2357869-2012_10_31_181816.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357869\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/24403/2357869-2012_10_31_181816.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/24403/2357869-2012_10_31_181816.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>18th century New Orleans is rendered in tremendous detail. It's one of the few things Liberation gets absolutely right.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Liberation also falters when it comes to supplementing the core gameplay with more objectives. When you get outside of New Orleans, only some of the late game areas are particularly fun to explore. More often you'll find yourself in the swampy bayou just outside the city, and that area is a terrible slog to dig through, not to mention surprisingly bereft of any additional activity outside of story missions. The game also features a multiplayer component, albeit a barely amusing one. Here, you're asked to choose a side (Templars or Assassins) and a hometown. It's not a fleshed-out multiplayer mode like in the console games, mind you. It basically boils down to a card-battling game, and how it actually works is poorly explained within the game itself, meaning you'll have to spend more time than you'll likely want to figuring out how to play it effectively.</p><p style=\"\">Liberation is a game you'll want to like. Its protagonist is an intriguing one, and her mission frequently teases greatness. But it never quite arrives, due to the developers' inability to marry the \"full-fledged\" Assassin's Creed gameplay to the Vita's form and function. There is undoubtedly a happy medium out there somewhere for this series on handhelds. There are things you can strip away to make a game like this more palatable to handheld players, and there are as many things you can keep to ensure that the grandiose spirit of the larger games is kept. Unfortunately, Liberation never quite nails those things down, resulting in a game that only delivers the goods in fits and starts.</p>", "deck": "Assassin's Creed III: Liberation tries to bring a console-quality blockbuster to a handheld with mixed results.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-540/", "platforms": "PlayStation Vita", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38507/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed-iii-liberation/3030-38507/", "id": 38507, "name": "Assassin's Creed III: Liberation"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-11-02 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117682/", "id": 117682, "name": "Assassin's Creed III: Liberation"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/hotline-miami-review/1900-541/", "description": "<p style=\"\">The year is 1989, and the place is Miami, Florida. You are standing outside the entrance to a building. There is a man on the other side of this door. He holds a gun. He is one of many men in this dilapidated building. They all hold guns, or knives, or bats. You do not know these men. You are only at this location at the behest of a mysterious answering machine message. Reasoning for your assignment is obfuscated, and yet your clarity of vision is startling. You know what must be done, and without hesitation, you do it. You kick the door in, knocking the man on the other side to the ground. You then mount him before he can regain his bearings, and begin slamming his skull into the ground.

And you will do so brutally, mercilessly, and swiftly. Learning why you are doing this is ostensibly the goal of Hotline Miami. All you know at the outset is that you are at the mercy of your own answering machine. Strange messages are left, indicating places to go, and people to kill, but they're as cryptic and muddied as your mind. It's perhaps apparent initially that you are not a well man. If not just because of all the wanton murder, but also because you see things. You talk to people who may or may not actually be who they say they are, or even exist at all. And then there are the guys in those creepy animal masks...</p><p style=\"\">This is a game that requires multiple play-throughs to uncover all its secrets, though even once you do, there are still some things left to the imagination. One thing that is not left to the imagination is the result of your gameplay. Every time you finish a level, you'll leave the place you were littered with corpses, spent shell casings, and buckets of spilled blood.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Of course, while you're playing, you won't have anything even resembling enough time to take in the carnage. Hotline Miami operates at a pace that can only be described as \"blistering.\" The moment you enter a building, you're effectively under duress until every single person is dead. Enemies are crackerjack shots, and instantly aware of you the second you cross their field of view, or make a noise. Given that the game uses a retro-inspired top-down perspective, it can sometimes be a bit difficult to gauge exactly what an enemy's eyeline might be. Fortunately, most anything that looks like an effective hiding spot is, and if it isn't? Well, it's not like you'll have time to think about what you've done, because you'll probably be dead.</p><p style=\"\">You will also die in Hotline Miami. Frequently, quickly, and with aplomb. One hit kills you, and once you're dead, you need only press a button to reset at the beginning of a level section. Levels are broken out by floors. All you need do is clear one floor and get to the next one for a checkpoint to trigger. This is important, because were each level to drag on just a bit longer, the game would give way to irritating repetition. As they are, levels are still fun to play no matter how many times you die. I think in one section, I died upwards of 50 times, yet just kept resetting to play. With gameplay this tight, this frenetic, this <i>exciting</i>, it's hard to want to walk away.</p><p style=\"\">With the right weapons, you can most certainly lay effective waste to the enemies before you without necessarily getting killed. But on your first play, you'll almost never have the most effective weapons at your disposal. This leads to improvisation, be it using doors as stunning agents, picking up weapons off of felled foes, or just using whatever the environment offers you to survive. The decrepit scenery isn't just window dressing. Let's say you see a pot of water boiling on the stove, and want to use it to scald a nearby bad guy. You can do that, and you should. Because it's horrible. And amazing.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4992/2297692-hlm5.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2297692\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4992/2297692-hlm5.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2297692\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4992/2297692-hlm5.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>Everybody dies. No exceptions.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The violence in Hotline Miami may be pixelated and obscured, but it's no less intense for it. The sheer speed at which you must operate, coupled with the tension of never being completely sure if an enemy will spot you if you creep around the next corner, is utterly gripping. You kill, kill, kill until there's nothing left but bodies, and you must do so with a ruthless efficiency that affords you no moment's pause to ponder the terrible things you've done.</p><p style=\"\">That comes later, via quick cutscenes featuring other characters that may or may not be wrapped up in this whole mess, and exploration of your apartment. The apartment area is essentially just a hub where you collect your next mission, but as the game rolls along, and your character's sanity begins to fray, the aesthetics begin to directly resemble the tatters of your psyche.</p><p style=\"\">That could be said of much of Hotline Miami's look and feel. The 1989 setting is no random choice. Every pixel of the game has been slathered in late-'80s grime. Its dirty, neon-tinted color palette blends brilliantly with the pulsing synth soundtrack, which is a particular highlight. Comparisons many have made to the Nicolas Winding-Refn film <i>Drive</i> are not inaccurate, nor accidental. The developers have cited that movie as a particular inspiration both aesthetically, and in the game's depiction of violence. If you find yourself nodding your head to the background grooves while doing horrible, detestable things, do not panic. This is very much the point.</p><p style=\"\">Enjoying Hotline Miami doesn't make you a worse person, though you may find yourself wrestling with just why the act of deftly delivered murder is so damn much fun. It is because it's a lovingly crafted game, well-designed and deeply addictive. These facts do little to soften the reality of what you're doing, of course. In some ways, Hotline Miami most closely resembles the kind of \"violent video game\" boogeyman parents groups were so outraged by back in the industry's more formative years. It's a game time-traveled in directly from the fear-center of Tipper Gore's brain, circa 1989. It's pure, unadulterated nihilism with a candy-coated shell. And I'll be damned if it isn't one of the most intoxicating games of this year.</p>", "deck": "Hotline Miami is a nightmare you won't want to forget.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-541/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39452/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/hotline-miami/3030-39452/", "id": 39452, "name": "Hotline Miami"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-11-05 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-120291/", "id": 120291, "name": "Hotline Miami"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/assassins-creed-iii-review/1900-542/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5207/2337455-tumblr_mb8thsd3a41qiu4oko1_1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2337455\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5207/2337455-tumblr_mb8thsd3a41qiu4oko1_1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2337455\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5207/2337455-tumblr_mb8thsd3a41qiu4oko1_1280.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Desmond finally gets some answers.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3025-38\" href=\"/assassins-creed/3025-38/\" slug=\"assassins-creed\">Assassin’s Creed</a> has always been a pretty complex machine. Right from the start, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-82\" href=\"/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/\" slug=\"ubisoft-entertainment\">Ubisoft</a> has played up the deliberately impenetrable premise of modern-day assassins and Templars fighting an ancient secret war, training their agents with technology that allows them to relive their assassinatin’ or Templarin’ ancestors’ experiences by tapping into their genetic memory. Turns out they didn’t need to try and obfuscate; as you head into <a data-ref-id=\"3030-37494\" href=\"/assassins-creed-iii/3030-37494/\" slug=\"assassins-creed-iii\">Assassin’s Creed III</a>--actually the fifth in the “main” Assassin’s Creed story, not even taking into consideration the handful of handheld digressions--the threat of a prophesized global apocalypse, cryptic messages from a highly advanced, long-dead civilization, and the emergence of the protagonist as a Christ figure make the game’s stratospherically high concept seem tame by comparison.</p><p style=\"\">Wrapping up five games worth of dense mystery and complex, wide-reaching gameplay systems while simultaneously establishing an as-yet-unseen historical era and accompanying meta-protagonist, as Assassin’s Creed III attempts, is a staggeringly ambitious undertaking. It’s impressive that the game succeeds as often as it does, particularly with regards to the game’s vision of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5163\" href=\"/american-revolution/3015-5163/\" slug=\"american-revolution\">American Revolutionary War</a> as seen through the conspiratorial cloak-and-dagger lens of the Assassin’s Creed universe, and the new gameplay systems that are tailored to address both the era and its scattered geography. The game stumbles a bit, though, when it comes to linking all of these systems together in a meaningful way, leaving you with an overabundance of side activities that, while often interesting on their own, feel inessential to the narrative progression. Assassin’s Creed III has pacing issues, too, spending hours upon hours up front before you even meet the game’s main protagonist, then rushing at a dead sprint towards the end, hastily and underwhelmingly wrapping up story threads that the series has spent years laying out.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5207/2337453-screenshot_19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2337453\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5207/2337453-screenshot_19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2337453\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5207/2337453-screenshot_19.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Connor Kenway, in his natural environment.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Assassin’s Creed III would’ve had plenty of heavy lifting to do had it chosen to focus purely on the conclusion of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-305\" href=\"/desmond-miles/3005-305/\" slug=\"desmond-miles\">Desmond Miles</a>’ story, the reluctant assassin whose brainpan has served as center stage for the series so far. Having already experienced the highlight reels of ancestors <a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"/altair-ibn-laahad/3005-48/\" slug=\"altair-ibn-laahad\">Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10269\" href=\"/ezio-auditore-da-firenze/3005-10269/\" slug=\"ezio-auditore-da-firenze\">Ezio Auditore</a> on his quest to at first save the assassins, then eventually the world, the questions about Desmond and the increasingly fantastical world around him have been piling up, and it’s time to make good on those promises. Much of that mythology gets addressed in Assassin’s Creed III, but as is often the case, the mystery is more interesting than the answers. Make no mistake, the fate of Desmond Miles and the immediate cosmic fate of the world at large are answered, though without the sort of finality that would prevent Ubisoft from continuing to move forward with the Assassin’s Creed story.</p><p style=\"\">The sequences where you play as Desmond have been expanded a bit over past games, but his story, which concerns itself with Desmond’s strained relationship with his father as much as it does decrypting the final pieces of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7256\" href=\"/the-first-civilization/3015-7256/\" slug=\"the-first-civilization\">First Civilization</a> puzzle, is still largely told in the margins. While there has always been a disconnect between Desmond and his ancestor, Assassin’s Creed III does a better job of establishing direct thematic connections between Desmond and the real star of the show, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-22428\" href=\"/connor-kenway/3005-22428/\" slug=\"connor-kenway\">Connor Kenway</a>, the son of an English nobleman and a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1632\" href=\"/native-american/3015-1632/\" slug=\"native-american\">Native American</a> woman living in the American Northeast during the time of the American Revolutionary War. Whereas Altaïr was a bit of a cipher, his character largely defined by his stubborn adherence to the dogma of the assassin’s code, and Ezio was all swagger and swashbuckle, Connor is a naive idealist filled with righteous fury, having been caught in the conflict between both the assassins and the Templars, as well as between the European colonists and his own people, since before he was even born. Connor’s uncompromising sense of honor and justice serve Assassin’s Creed III well as it plunges him right in the middle of the American Revolutionary War. While American history has always lionized the founding fathers, any war is mostly a series of bad compromises, and the game gets some mileage out of good men making bad choices.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2331685-aciii_frontier_johnsonassassination_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2331685\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5624\" data-width=\"5000\" style=\"width: 5000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2331685-aciii_frontier_johnsonassassination_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2331685\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2331685-aciii_frontier_johnsonassassination_screenshot.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2331685-aciii_frontier_johnsonassassination_screenshot.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Getting up-close and personal with your tomahawk is muderously satisfying.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Historical settings are a fundamental part of the Assassin’s Creed experience, but Connor’s story is inextricably interwoven with the course of the war itself in a way that the series has rarely approached. You won’t just bear witness to famous historical events like the Boston Tea Party, The Battle at Lexington and Concord, or Paul Revere’s Ride, you’ll actually take part in them, oftentimes setting them in motion in the first place. It can feel a little silly at times, bordering on <i>Forrest Gump/National Treasure</i> territory, but it’s no small part of Assassin’s Creed III’s effort to give the game a distinct sense of place.</p><p style=\"\">Geography is important to the politics of Assassin’s Creed III, and the ways in which it sets the gameplay here apart from previous games cannot be overstated. Assassin’s Creed has primarily dwelled in dense, ancient cities that have spent thousands of years building upwards towards a dizzying sense of verticality. Such infrastructure doesn’t exist, at least not with the same density, in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-433\" href=\"/boston/3035-433/\" slug=\"boston\">Boston</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3656\" href=\"/new-york/3035-3656/\" slug=\"new-york\">New York</a>, and the wilderness in-between during the mid-to-late 1700s, which is when and where Assassin’s Creed III primarily takes place. Other than streamlining the free-running system to make it much harder to accidentally leap to your death--which is a convenience when you’re in-town and an absolute necessity when you’re scampering along tree branches in the new wilderness area--the basic traversal mechanics of Assassin’s Creed remain largely unchanged. Because of the more wide-open geography, as well as a more generous, if somewhat-inconsistent fast-travel system, though, I found myself inherently taking to the rooftops less often to avoid trouble.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5207/2311892-connor_face.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2311892\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54319180087848\" data-width=\"1366\" style=\"width: 1366px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5207/2311892-connor_face.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2311892\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5207/2311892-connor_face.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5207/2311892-connor_face.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Connor contemplates burying his tomahawk into someone's skull.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The fast-travel system also plays into the issues with side missions in Assassin’s Creed III. After learning its lesson with the mission monotony of the original Assassin’s Creed, the series has been jam-packed with a variety of distractions, from real estate and empire-building to item-collection and crafting, sometimes to the point of being overstuffed. Assassin’s Creed III rolls back some of the clumsier activities introduced in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34975\" href=\"/assassins-creed-revelations/3030-34975/\" slug=\"assassins-creed-revelations\">Revelations</a>, and simplifies others, but it introduces a number of new ones, and there’s still plenty of trouble to get into before taking on the next story mission. You can help frontiersmen in need to build up your homestead, Connor’s base of operations; hunt and collect skins from a variety of skittish animals in the wilderness; take to the open seas as a privateer and battle others in the thrilling and visually stunning naval battles; and intervene in random encounters between villainous Redcoats and innocent civilians, just to name a few.</p><p style=\"\">They’re not all winners, but the real problem is how inessential all of the side activities feel. Being able to more easily fast travel across large swaths of land means it’s easier to simply miss a lot of these activities. In the past, the simple act of getting from Point A to Point B--beyond being one of the simple, fundamental pleasures of playing Assassin’s Creed--would expose you to a lot of this stuff, and it was easy to take a quick detour and buy a building, stab a guy, collect a feather, or whatever. The bigger problem is that, beyond the early missions that initially introduce the different types of side activities, the main story progression gives you little reason to ever engage in any of this stuff. Some of it, like the naval missions, are fun enough on their own, but more often than not, I found my compulsion to see the next story beat unfold far outweighed any of the other distractions presented.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2294492-ac3gc2012_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2294492\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2294492-ac3gc2012_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2294492\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2294492-ac3gc2012_05.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2294492-ac3gc2012_05.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Always a good way to start a fight.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Issues of cohesion aside, I still found Assassin’s Creed III fundamentally enjoyable to play. Story missions that focus on eavesdropping on enemy conversations or chasing enemies through the streets can be unforgiving and frustrating, but there’s generally a good variety to them, and the free-flowing, kinetic combat system, while mostly familiar, is still as brutal and satisfying as ever. As you might expect from the radical change in location, Assassin’s Creed III is a much different-looking game than its predecessors, and while there are frame-rate and pop-in issues, it can be an intermittently gorgeous game, with its heavy weather effects and the open wilderness standing out as particular highlights.</p><p style=\"\">The unique Assassin’s Creed multiplayer first introduced in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31001\" href=\"/assassins-creed-brotherhood/3030-31001/\" slug=\"assassins-creed-brotherhood\">Brotherhood</a> continues to get refined in Assassin’s Creed III. Previously contextualized as a training simulation to help Templar soldiers fight the assassins on their own terms, Abstergo has brazenly taken its Animus project mainstream, selling it to the public as the next big gaming system through a series of convincingly phony live-action advertisements that you unlock as you level up. Some minor gameplay tweaks have been made, such as adding audio cues to let you know when you’ve got line-of-sight on your target or when your hunter has line-of-sight on you. In addition to the returning suite of high-tension player-versus-player modes, there’s a new co-op mode called Wolf Pack, where four players team up against a series of increasingly wily AI targets while a countdown clock limits your progression to the next target. It’s the Assassin’s Creed version of wave-based survival, and it can be fun, and less stressful than the PvP, though like most Horde modes, you’ll want to assemble a familiar group if you really want to succeed.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Assassin’s Creed III is a step up from last year’s Assassin’s Creed: Revelations, which saw Ezio’s story overstay its welcome and made some major miscalculations with its new mechanics, but it’s still not Assassin’s Creed at its finest.

It's also the first to feel like it's coming from developers that realize that this franchise is in need of some more meaningful changes than new maps and a retooled multiplayer unlock system. That manifests most clearly in the game's ambitious single-player campaign, which isn't without fault, but the way it integrates player choice into the proceedings is fantastic, helping you to craft a Call of Duty tale that feels like a product of the decisions you make along the way. The rest of the package? Pretty much exactly what you'd expect, but a little bigger and a little bolder.</p><p style=\"\">The single-player portion of Black Ops II is split between two eras, giving you a chance to check-in on <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17021\" href=\"/alex-mason/3005-17021/\" slug=\"alex-mason\">Alex Mason</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17104\" href=\"/frank-woods/3005-17104/\" slug=\"frank-woods\">Frank Woods</a> as they tear up the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2988\" href=\"/central-intelligence-agency/3015-2988/\" slug=\"central-intelligence-agency\">CIA</a>'s hottest secret conflicts of the '80s while also giving you control of Mason's son, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-23199\" href=\"/david-mason/3005-23199/\" slug=\"david-mason\">David</a>, in the year 2025. The past is told via flashback as the younger Mason visits Frank Woods, now confined to a wheelchair, but almost every mission is focused on the same target: Raul Menendez. This terrorist is up to no good in the \"present\" day, but David Mason needs to know why this guy is so persistent and, seemingly, so focused on Mason himself. The reasons go back to when his father and Woods were hot on the guy's trail.</p><p style=\"\">All of this story is set against a new Cold War with <a data-ref-id=\"3035-343\" href=\"/china/3035-343/\" slug=\"china\">China</a>, but the world's problems take a backseat to the more personal story of Menendez, his sister, and his over-the-top quest for revenge against the guys that wronged him. By the end, he's controlling huge drone fleets and bringing the world to the brink of war. It's outlandish and ridiculous to think that one determined man could bring all this about. It's the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a proper action movie, which, with all the jumping back and forth between quiet nights deep inside Noriega's Panama and the deck of an aircraft carrier as it comes under attack, sums up the pacing and feel of Black Ops II's campaign. Compared to the past games in the series, the story feels far more personal. It still jumps between characters in traditional Call of Duty fashion, but each character is meaningful and each conflict is more directly tied to the overall plot. It unfolds in a fascinating way, and you'll actually have some very real agency in how that plot unfolds.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2366844-599707_438113359542997_1797560205_n.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2366844\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2366844-599707_438113359542997_1797560205_n.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2366844\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2366844-599707_438113359542997_1797560205_n.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>The Strike Force missions put you on a multiplayer level with a crew of AI guys to control, but at times it just feels broken.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The Black Ops II campaign lets you make choices that can wildly impact the events that follow. Those choices start at the beginning of each mission, which lets you configure your own loadout and select some additional items and perks, further merging concepts from the game's multiplayer side into the campaign. It's a neat option, but the default configuration, which includes a tool kit that lets you pry open optional doors and chests to get some additional items throughout the game, is usually sufficient.</p><p style=\"\">From there, though, the choices aren't always so obvious. Yes, you'll get a couple of \"press X to shoot that guy, press A to spare him\" sort of moments, and those are tense for their own reasons, but the interesting thing about Black Ops II is that it doesn't always telegraph its branches. Most of the decisions come as a part of gameplay. In one case, and without saying too much about the actual setting, you'll hear from other characters that some intel is in danger of being destroyed by the enemy. As you enter the area, you'll start to see characters scramble and attempt to burn paperwork. If you stop them, that intel is yours. If they manage to burn the information, that's one piece of the puzzle that you won't have. Some of these only payoff with additional lines of dialogue. Others make you suspect characters of wrongdoing by filling in a few more blanks than you'd have if you just shoot your way through the game without thinking about it. And others have a direct impact on who lives and who dies. It's not that every single choice is incredibly vital and Earth-shattering. It's that you're never quite sure that you're doing the right thing or behaving in the right way, and the route to what you'd probably consider the \"happiest\" version of the ending isn't clear. In a year filled with games that handle player choice in different ways, the Black Ops II campaign manages to be right up there with the best.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Strip away the interesting wrapper and, well, you've got something that pretty closely resembles the tone and pacing of most Call of Duty campaigns. You'll shoot your way into and out of situations in the past and in the future, and most of that gameplay boils down to pulling the left trigger to snap onto a guy and pulling the right trigger to take him out. At least it's better about not making you feel like you're just following an invincible AI character with a helpful \"FOLLOW\" tag placed above its head through the entire game. Some areas are much larger than you'd expect to see in a Call of Duty campaign, like an Afghanistan level that has you riding horses from place to place as you try to cut off a Russian attack. At times the action more closely resembles <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2\" href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" slug=\"halo\">Halo</a>'s wide-open, multi-approach areas than the tight corridors and one-track focus you've come to expect from the franchise. Outside of that, however, things in the campaign start to fray under scrutiny. Parts of the campaign feel a little disjointed as you leap from one part of the world to another with thin connective tissue between some of the missions. And that jet flying portion that they've been showing off since <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3168\" href=\"/e3/3015-3168/\" slug=\"e3\">E3</a>? Not fun at all.</p><p style=\"\">Black Ops II also includes optional missions that play out on a few of the game's multiplayer maps. These \"Strike Force\" missions give you multiple objectives to complete, such as a series of missile batteries that must be hacked in a way that makes you feel like you're taking over a multiplayer control point. But the catch is that you're controlling an entire force of men and drones. You can swap to any other unit quickly via the D-pad, or pull out to a tactical view. In either view, you're able to issue commands to the other soldiers, presumably to move them around the battlefield and have them fortify positions. If you fail a Strike Force mission, you'll be able to retry it, but you have a limited number of retries. If you fail to complete these missions, the outcome of the overall story changes. And, depending on how you perform in the \"normal\" levels, you might not even see all of the possible Strike Force scenarios. It's a fascinating idea that would work out a lot better if the AI didn't appear to be completely broken. On numerous occasions I'd issue orders to my AI-controlled troops and get no response. They'd just stand around their spawning area and do absolutely nothing, forcing me to take very direct control of the action. I was still able to complete the missions without much issue, too, which sort of defeats the whole purpose. It's a neat idea that feels completely half-baked, at best.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2366846-403472_438706666150333_1647355519_n.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2366846\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2366846-403472_438706666150333_1647355519_n.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2366846\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2366846-403472_438706666150333_1647355519_n.jpeg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2366846-403472_438706666150333_1647355519_n.jpeg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game's got a good selection of multiplayer maps to keep you busy.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once you've completed the campaign, you can go back and attempt to see some of the different ways it can play out, but you'll have to do this via a \"rewind story\" option that essentially rolls your save file back to an earlier state. From there, you can play out whatever alternate choices you like and see the game through to a different conclusion. You can also just replay any mission, but you can't alter any of your choices if you go that route. All told, it's a surprisingly satisfying campaign, even considering the failure of the Strike Force missions. The story is the star here, with clever care given to making the player understand Menendez's actions. It also goes in some gory directions, with a weird focus on forcing you to stare into peoples' eyes as they're being horrifically murdered, often by your hand. It's more hilarious or hokey than haunting, but maybe that just means I'm a soulless husk that has become completely unable to feel anything, ever.</p><p style=\"\">Which brings us to multiplayer. Black Ops II rewrites the rules for unlocking things and creating classes yet again. You'd think that at least one of the studios working on this franchise would have gotten it right by now. But the way Black Ops II handles class creation is an interesting break from the norm that will feel subtle to casual players. Rather than just filling out the class creation form in a slightly different way, Black Ops II lets you rewrite it a bit. Want to take six perks into combat instead of the standard three? There's a way to do that, but it involves carrying no grenades and only one attachment-free gun. Want to go in completely bare? Sure, strip it all away and run in with no perks and just a knife to keep you company. All this is done in such a way that you can even further create classes that cater to your play style, and the results are interesting. But you still have to deal with weapons that unlock in a set order (though even then you need to cash in an unlock token in order to actually use any of the new things you're unlocking). That means you'll level up and, yay, you've unlocked a sniper rifle that you'll never use. Or, at least, <i>I'll</i> never use it. After six years of playing this game with varying degrees of prowess, I know what I like. Climbing up the unlock tree yet again only to see it filled with options that I'll never want to use just sounds like more trouble than it's worth at this point.</p><p style=\"\">That said, the action continues to feel snappy and it responds precisely the way you'd expect a Call of Duty game to respond. It's covered with the same sorts of playlists and game types you'd expect to see, including last year's Kill Confirmed. A new mode, called Hardpoint, brings a King of the Hill-type experience to the game that recalls Headquarters but feels faster and more dynamic since you won't have to wait until an HQ is destroyed before you spawn again. The wager match modes of the original Black Ops return with full, proper matchmaking support, but it's a shame that more modes weren't added here, as they're still pretty cool, even if you're not actually wagering anything this time around. Diving to prone by holding the duck button while running is back in the game--hopefully to stay this time. Bots are also available and they appear in a new matchmaking mode for new players, too.</p><p style=\"\">Around the action, some additional changes have been made. There's a new spectator mode and a weirdly limited ability to stream out some of your matches live on YouTube. There's also a league option that lets you go in alone or team up with players to play placement matches and make your way onto a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\" href=\"/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/3030-20674/\" slug=\"starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty\">StarCraft II</a>-like ladder system, which should be pretty cool for people who take this stuff more seriously than most. Additionally, the 13 maps that ship with the game are quite good, ranging in size and shape while still retaining that core Call of Duty concept of ensuring that, unless you're working with a team, you'll probably get shot in the back a lot. It's easy to moan about the way that the core experience has remained largely unchanged across almost all of Black Ops II, but, for as much as I feel like I'm ready to say \"OK, this is it, this is the last year,\" it still sucks me back in. But it does so a little less each time out. By this point, I've built up a solid tolerance to this game's multiplayer charms. It's well-made and looks great, but I find myself playing less and less of it every year. I don't see anything here that's going to reverse that trend, but the changes in multiplayer are intelligently designed.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2366847-541143_486544931366506_1115765468_n.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2366847\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2366847-541143_486544931366506_1115765468_n.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2366847\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2366847-541143_486544931366506_1115765468_n.jpeg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2366847-541143_486544931366506_1115765468_n.jpeg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yup. Zombies.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The third main menu option in Black Ops II simply says \"Zombies.\" This <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\" href=\"/horde-mode/3015-3021/\" slug=\"horde-mode\">wave-based survival mode</a> has become incredibly popular on its own and, now more than ever, it feels completely out of place when put next to the rest of the package. Tonally, it's full of a bunch of quirky, weird characters and dialogue that, as someone who didn't obsessively play the mode in the last <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2275\" href=\"/black-ops/3025-2275/\" slug=\"black-ops\">Black Ops</a>, makes no sense whatsoever. New modes have been added, including one that lets you get on a bus and move between multiple large areas, rather than being simply confined to a tight, single space. There's also a new multiplayer option that lets two teams of four annoy each other while also fighting zombies. In this mode, called Grief, you can't directly damage the opposing team, but you can shoot or stab them to blur their vision and shove them around the map, hopefully into a collection of zombies. This was a neat idea back in World at War, and I understand that people seem to like it, but I just can't stand it. All the dopey little upgrades and \"monkey bombs\" and its deliberately opaque story add up to something that deserves to be broken out into its own game, if only to get it out of this game that I otherwise enjoy quite a bit. I'll take Spec Ops mode over Zombies any day of the week.</p><p style=\"\">The presentation end of Black Ops II is buoyed by a terrific dedication to making kick-ass weapon effects. On the appropriate sound system, each rifle shot sounds intense in a way that most other shooters don't match, and in cases where the audio designers have had to invent effects for futuristic weapons, there's a tasteful restraint that keeps them from sounding like ridiculous ray guns. The audio hits hard, even if the little \"surprise\" post-credit song sequence leaves you with a bad sound in your ears when all is said and done. Visually, the game looks better than its predecessors, with the most obvious improvement showing on the faces of the people you talk to in the campaign. They look more lifelike than they have in the past, which helps get the game's story across. It also handles large areas quite nicely, without huge sacrifices to the frame rate.</p><p style=\"\">It's weird to come away feeling positive about a game right after you've just told someone that a full third of it is essentially useless to you, but then Call of Duty: Black Ops II is a big game with a whole lot going on. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, and some of the multiplayer changes feel more like they're propping up an aging concept rather than truly moving it forward, even though it's still a good way to spend time with your online friends.

While this could have served as an interesting segue between the events of that game and the just-released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38039\" href=\"/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/3030-38039/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-black-ops-ii\">Black Ops II</a>, Declassified is a disjointed mess of meaningless missions played against a clock backed up with a multiplayer mode that occasionally approximates something that resembled proper <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> combat. More often, though, the game feels too small to be entertaining, with maps so tiny that you'll literally spawn with an enemy in your crosshairs... or vice versa. This would be a questionable purchase at traditional downloadable pricing. But at $50? No way.</p><p style=\"\">To fit on the Vita, some control adjustments have been made. The triggers handle your aiming and shooting, but many of the other maneuvers--grenade tossing and melee attacks, specifically--have been moved to the touch screen. The rear touch is used to steady your aim while sniping and the game utilizes an auto-sprint option to keep things moving at a Call of Duty-like pace. But at best, controlling the action feels like a bootleg knockoff of real Call of Duty. Basic movement feels awkward and the auto-sprint feels unreliable, making it tougher to get away from grenades. It almost feels like the developers realized this, because the fuses on grenades feel way longer. Call of Duty has always been about snapping to your target when playing against AI opposition, and that snapping feels positively vital on the Vita. Turning with the right stick, despite a sensitivity slider, never feels <i>right</i>. Multiplayer matches, as a result, look like a collection of broken robots mindlessly running around tight corridors, passing one another, then clumsily turning to fire. As if that all wasn't weird enough, all enemies--human or otherwise--feel like they take three or four more bullets to drop. It's a messy game to play, and that feel permeates every mode.</p><p style=\"\">The primary solo mode is a series of profoundly short time trials that put you, as either Alex Mason or Frank Woods, into a quick mission. You're given a few seconds of start-up storyline and sent on your way. There are no checkpoints, so if you die, shoot hostages, or stumble into some other failure state, you'll have to start the entire mission over. Most missions are only a few minutes long, so the lack of checkpoints isn't the end of the world, but it sure is a weird thing to include as your main single-player mode. You'll get cutscenes between missions, but no overarching story.</p><p style=\"\">The AI you'll face in these missions is embarrassing. Enemies, seemingly aware that the game's controls are kind of bad, occasionally just stand there for a bit, giving you time to take them out at your leisure. Sometimes enemies two rooms ahead of you will just start shooting in your direction where they stand, even though there are multiple walls between you and them. Incidentally, this actually works out in your favor in some cases, since the game is sort of bad about telling you where you're supposed to be going. So just follow the gunfire. In an ideal situation, these missions would be good enough to inspire you to play them over and over again and place higher on the game's online leaderboards. But that is most definitely not the case.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2295389\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2295389\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The enemy AI is wildly erratic and feels broken at times.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game also has a handful of time trials, which pit you against wooden targets as you try to get through a set of obstacle courses as quickly as possible. Hey, remember how Call of Duty games used to have the training course thing that would let you see which difficulty mode you should play on? Ever wish that this old idea was turned into a small mode of its own? Yeah, me neither. Hostiles mode, which is a wave-based survival mode, spawns in dozens of enemies for you to gun down and, between waves, drops supply crates to let you restock. Enemies typically make a beeline for your location, but they're also likely to get hung up on level geometry and just sort of vibrate up against a wall.</p><p style=\"\">The most interesting option is eight-player multiplayer, which is built on a limited set of the same fundamentals that power other Call of Duty games. You'll gain levels, create custom classes with perks, weapon attachments, and more. It has a handful of modes, too, including Kill Confirmed and Drop Zone, which has you fighting over control of a single point on the map. It can handle up to eight players, which manages to be enough for the little maps included in the game. Remember how Nuketown always seemed like it was a little small? How about Nuke<i>house</i>, which is a sectioned-off half of the original Nuketown map? No? On one hand, there's something novel about a handheld version of Call of Duty. But not like this.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The game is strangely quiet, even after a launch day patch that claims to adjust the sound levels. It feels like it's missing music or some more ambient battlefield noise. While we're talking about audio, it's worth noting that most of the original voice actors do not reprise their roles here. The graphics are often decent, but the stilted, awkward character movement just makes the action look strange.</p><p style=\"\">The game is also plagued with a handful of technical issues. Multiplayer matches are often hard to connect to, and if you're connecting to what <a data-ref-id=\"3010-313\" href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" slug=\"sony-computer-entertainment-america\">Sony</a> refers to as a \"Type 3\" NAT, attempting to select the multiplayer menu at all simply pops up an \"Insufficient NAT\" message, preventing you from playing the multiplayer mode at all. Menus sometimes seem to freeze up for seconds at a time, preventing you from making a selection and moving forward. Joining multiplayer games often sends you back to the main menu instead of into a game. And the game can get caught in some sort of loop that causes it to pop up a wireless network error message over the single-player action without actually pausing the action. The game's already seen one patch, which put in an Ad Hoc multiplayer mode, but it's in need of more.</p><p style=\"\">So it's a bad game on its own, but the technical issues really twist the knife already buried in Declassified's dark heart. Allow me to remind you that this game is $50. Do not buy this game for $50.</p>", "deck": "You'd think that the people in charge of the Call of Duty franchise would be more protective of it than this.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-544/", "platforms": "PlayStation Vita", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38542/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-declassified/3030-38542/", "id": 38542, "name": "Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified"}, "score": 1, "publish_date": "2012-11-14 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-121100/", "id": 121100, "name": "Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/new-super-mario-bros-u-review/1900-545/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227550-newsupermariobrosu7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227550\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227550-newsupermariobrosu7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227550\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227550-newsupermariobrosu7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The flying squirrel suit is the first new thing you'll notice.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-35574\" href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-u/3030-35574/\" slug=\"new-super-mario-bros-u\">New Super Mario Bros. U</a> is the fourth platformer to come along since Nintendo brought back the original 2D style of Mario action a few years ago on the DS, and as such, it isn't all that \"new\" anymore. But it fits nicely in the role of a sturdy, well-made <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1\" href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a> nostalgia piece to go along with your freshly purchased launch <a data-ref-id=\"3045-139\" href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" slug=\"wii-u\">Wii U</a>. There are some inventive new touches scattered here and there in some of the game's individual levels, and the whole package serves as a wonderfully promising early example of what Nintendo's artists will be able to do with high-definition graphics at their disposal. At the same time, the game sticks a little too closely to the precise formula employed by its three predecessors, which makes it a shame Nintendo didn't see fit to get a little more creative here.</p><p style=\"\">To put it bluntly, your interest in NSMBU will hinge on how much of the previous three games you played, and how recently you played them. There are eight worlds here, among them a green world, an ocean world, an ice world, and a desert world (and yes, the desert world is the second one). Every level has three star coins to find if you want more to do than simply run to the right till you jump onto the flag pole. There are koopa kids zooming around in airships, but I'll leave it to you to guess how many times you have to jump on their heads to beat them. The same weird save-game quirks are still in here that keep you from making a hard save until you beat a boss. If you've played any of the other New Super Mario games (or heck, any 2D Mario ever, really), you'll be intimately familiar with the basics of this game before you even dig into it.</p><p style=\"\">That's not to say there's <i>nothing</i> new about NSMBU. The most immediate addition is the flying squirrel suit that you encounter in the very first level, which lets you glide slowly after a jump, get a single altitude boost while in midair by doing your spin move, and cling to walls for a few seconds (though I found myself inadvertently sticking to walls at times I <i>didn't</i> want to as often as times I did). There's been an obvious effort to spruce up the overworld map, which now contains a bunch of timing-based elements like miniature enemies that cross your path and, if you run into them, spawn short little action levels in between the preset stages. That kind of stuff does change up the flow a bit, as do a handful of new enemy types. And it's awfully nice to ride around on <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" slug=\"yoshi\">Yoshi</a> again, even if he only pops up in a surprisingly small handful of places. But the ins and outs of the individual levels don't play around with the conventions of 2D Mario action nearly as much as I would have liked, and while a few levels do get a little creative with elements like light and darkness, you won't find anywhere near the level of invention that you saw in the best recent Mario games, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16094\" href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3030-16094/\" slug=\"super-mario-galaxy\">Galaxy</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34303\" href=\"/super-mario-3d-land/3030-34303/\" slug=\"super-mario-3d-land\">3D Land</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26317/1806007-wiiu_mario_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1806007\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"928\" style=\"width: 928px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/26317/1806007-wiiu_mario_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1806007\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26317/1806007-wiiu_mario_5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>MIIS DO NOT BELONG IN MARIO GAMES.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Aside from playing it too safe, Nintendo's gravest miscalculation with this game is releasing it a mere three months after <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38064\" href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-2/3030-38064/\" slug=\"new-super-mario-bros-2\">New Super Mario Bros. 2</a> on the 3DS. That will only matter if you're the sort of person who keeps up with all of Nintendo's first-party games when they're new, but if you are that sort of person (as I am), NSMBU is just going to feel like too much, too soon. Of course, if it's been years since you played one of these games, this one will feel a lot more invigorating, and hell, if you've never played a New Super Mario game before, U is practically a must-have. But coming almost directly off of the 3DS game, you can't help feeling like Nintendo is pouring the dancing turtles and wah-wahs on a little thick right now. It doesn't help that specific musical cues and voice samples like \"It's Mario time!\" are lifted <i>straight</i> out of that last portable game.</p><p style=\"\">Like the Wii game, NSMBU turns into a very different experience when you add more players into the mix. But that experience is exactly the same sort of barely-controlled four-player chaos as you saw in the Wii game: fun in short bursts if you have company over, but don't expect to make any serious progress or grab every single item. The addition of an assistive fifth player on the gamepad who can draw in makeshift platforms for the four characters onscreen is a nice twist. But it's absolutely ludicrous that you can't use the gamepad to control Mario in a multiplayer game, where only players with Wii remotes can play as actual characters. That, and the fact you can't play the game at all with the new Nintendo-made Pro controller, are just inexcusable. Overall, the multiplayer mode can get a little too manic for my tastes, so luckily the handful of peripheral modes in here will do a better job of testing your Mario mettle without some jerk jumping on your head every five seconds. There's a neat, diverse set of challenges that want you to do specific things like dodge fireballs for as long as you can, or glide with the flying squirrel suit across an entire level without touching the ground. And the boost rush mode gets pretty silly, since it scrolls the level faster the more coins you pick up. But since you'll notice levels from the main game popping up in here pretty quickly, the side challenges feel more like a novelty than something to spend serious time on.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227554-newsupermariobrosu12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227554\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227554-newsupermariobrosu12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227554\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227554-newsupermariobrosu12.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227554-newsupermariobrosu12.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>How come more of the game can't look like this?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One thing New Super Mario Bros. U does so very right is its graphics, at least from the standpoint of technical execution. The game's visual presentation is a master class of polished, shiny perfection, looking about as good in high definition as you would expect a Nintendo game to look. Though, aside from a dramatically increased pixel count, the aesthetics of this 2D Mario game are barely distinguishable from those of the other 2D Mario games of the last few years, and while I can appreciate a simple increase in fidelity applied to the sort of work that's already been established, I really wish the Wii U's hardware had been harnessed to send Mario through some worlds we really haven't seen before. Why does every game need a desert world and an ice world? There's a single standout instance in this game that basically amounts to Van Gogh's <i>Starry Night</i> rendered in the form of a Mario level, but beyond that, it's all too familiar. Why?</p><p style=\"\">It's worth noting that buying NSMBU will currently also net you a pretty darn good handheld game, since you get the exact same thing on the gamepad's controller screen that you see on your TV (aside from a slight but noticeable decrease in resolution). I suspect that novelty will wear off as the Wii U becomes commonplace and more games offer the ability to simply turn off your TV and go lie in your bed while continuing your game. But for now, the seamlessness with which you can transition between big and small screens, without fiddling with syncing another device or downloading some companion app or whatever--just hit pause and go in the other room and you're done--is still mighty impressive.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Everything about New Super Mario Bros.

Apparently so.

Like most party games, a good portion of Nintendo Land's short, simplistic games don't stay interesting for long when you're playing by yourself. But if you can get five like-minded people into a room, and you've made the admittedly hefty investment in controllers to get all of them playing together, Nintendo Land can make for a pretty riotous good time.</p><p style=\"\">As minigame collections go, this one begins with grander ambitions than Wii Sports' simple menu-driven list of activities. Nintendo Land isn't just the title on the game box, but also a vibrant theme park that acts as an interactive hub where you run your Mii around, walking right up to the attractions and hopping into them when you want to play them. Coins that you earn by playing each game can be cashed into a centrally located <a href=\"http://www.priceisright.com/show/games/plinko\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plinko</a>-like game that earns you all kinds of little Nintendo-themed trinkets that decorate the park grounds, and the whole package is just wallpapered with retro-styled Nintendo artwork and bursting with 8-bit-sounding classic music. I also couldn't help being charmed by the droll humor of your monotone computer-screen guide, Monita. As a longtime Nintendo fan, Nintendo Land is easy to love right out of the gate, though if a game called \"Nintendo Land\" weren't immediately lovable, there would be a real problem.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2321087-wiiunlandpikminadvscrn01wp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2321087\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.125\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2321087-wiiunlandpikminadvscrn01wp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2321087\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2321087-wiiunlandpikminadvscrn01wp.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of the games are more successful than others. Pikmin's OK.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Anyway, the meat of the package is obviously in the minigames, and while a couple of them wear thin pretty quickly, the majority of the dozen games on offer here collectively add up to a unique experience that makes it feel like there might be something to this whole Wii U thing. The absolute best of the games are, unsurprisingly, the three that pit the most people against each other in head-to-head competition. These are themed with <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1\" href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2098\" href=\"/luigis-mansion/3025-2098/\" slug=\"luigis-mansion\">Luigi's Mansion</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-32\" href=\"/animal-crossing/3025-32/\" slug=\"animal-crossing\">Animal Crossing</a>, and each is essentially some variation on Pac-Man, where the four players on the TV have limited information but the benefit of numbers, while the sole opposing player on the gamepad has greater awareness of the playing field but has to stare down four-to-one odds. Each game features a unique twist--Luigi incorporates stealth while Animal Crossing demands the gamepad player control two characters independently with the two analog sticks--and these three games in particular gave rise to the sort of heated competitive yelling that I thought this office full of jaded old games writers had lost their capacity to produce.</p><p style=\"\">I expected to write off all the single-player minigames in Nintendo Land after trying them each once, but several of them really stuck with me, primarily the ones that make the smartest use of the Wii U's unique two-screen setup. My favorite, called simply Yoshi's Fruit Cart, has you trying to move Yoshi around a basic field on the television to pick up a bunch of fruit. You see everything on the touchscreen that you see on the TV, minus the fruit, and you have to draw a path from fruit to fruit without actually being able to see any of it. As you start running into fruit that moves or that you have to pick up in a specific order, this mode gets devilishly tricky, despite its initial simplicity. Another game styled after <a data-ref-id=\"3030-86\" href=\"/balloon-fight/3030-86/\" slug=\"balloon-fight\">Balloon Fight</a> has you blowing gusts of wind by swiping the touchscreen, and a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-154\" href=\"/donkey-kong/3025-154/\" slug=\"donkey-kong\">Donkey Kong</a>-themed race course makes you tilt the Wii U's GamePad back and forth to roll a little two-wheeled contraption from level to level without turning it over and spilling the egg it's carrying. These games have a grounded, tactile feel that makes them great fun to play, and their adherence to a less-is-more design sensibility makes them fun to come back to repeatedly.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2321083-wiiunlandmariochasescrn04wp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2321083\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2321083-wiiunlandmariochasescrn04wp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2321083\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2321083-wiiunlandmariochasescrn04wp.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2321083-wiiunlandmariochasescrn04wp.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>He always does.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Ironically, the games that try the hardest to recreate some of Nintendo's biggest, most complex franchises, like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-3\" href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\" slug=\"metroid\">Metroid</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-9\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda\">Zelda</a>, were the ones I felt the least urge to spend extra time with. The Metroid game lets you fly around in Samus' ship or run around on foot to shoot at classic enemies, but that sort of gameplay doesn't make particularly engaging use of the gamepad's unique capabilities. Zelda likewise sends you against multiple waves of enemies in some hack-and-slashy combat (albeit with up to five people), and although the encounters do get a little more complex as you go, the whole thing still tends to feel a bit mindless. Though, the version of Pikmin that's in here feels surprisingly similar to the real thing, and lets players with Wii remotes take control of oversized Pikmin that the main player on the GamePad can pick up and throw along with the smaller minions. Just about every one of the minigames in Nintendo Land comes with one or more variants that focus on specific challenges or one-off versus modes, which gives you some reason to dig a little deeper even when you've had your fill of the primary mode. And performing well in each of them will earn you more of those sweet, sweet coins you can drop into the Plinko machine to fill your park with.</p><p style=\"\">There's a good possibility that if you're interested in getting a Wii U at all, you'll end up with Nintendo Land anyway, since the game is bundled with the deluxe package that includes the black version of the console, four times as much internal storage, and a two-year discount on eShop games. That whole package is $10 less than buying the basic white Wii U model and Nintendo Land separately, and the good news is, Nintendo Land provides enough rousing minigames--provided you've got the players and the hardware--and a convincing enough case for the new control scheme to make it a worthwhile companion piece alongside your new Wii U.</p>", "deck": "If you want to find out exactly what that big new Wii U controller is good for, Nintendo Land is your best bet right now.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-546/", "platforms": null, "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38549/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-land/3030-38549/", "id": 38549, "name": "Nintendo Land"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-11-18 15:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/hitman-absolution-review/1900-547/", "description": "<p style=\"\">What kind of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-306\" href=\"/hitman/3025-306/\" slug=\"hitman\">Hitman</a> are you?

Io makes some attempts to invest you more in Absolution's plot and the greater Hitman mythology this time around, some of which are successful, some less so. That said, whatever missteps the story might take largely pale in comparison to the wealth of replay value contained within Absolution. If your favored thing is coming up with increasingly creative ways to kill just about anybody, then Absolution is absolutely your huckleberry. Also, maybe seek professional help.</p><p style=\"\">In Absolution, the series inviolable bar-coded protagonist, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-889\" href=\"/agent-47/3005-889/\" slug=\"agent-47\">Agent 47</a>, is back for another round of contract murderin', though this time the target is more personal. The game opens with 47 assigned to extinguish his longtime Agency handler <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1841\" href=\"/diana-burnwood/3005-1841/\" slug=\"diana-burnwood\">Diana</a>. She's reportedly turned rogue, simultaneously exposing the Agency's misdeeds to the public and kidnapping a teenage girl who is extremely important to the Agency's new head, a bloated, loathsome man who looks a little bit like Nick Offerman after a few decades on the bottle.</p><p style=\"\">47 dutifully does his task, but upon reaching Diana in her highly secured, out-of-the-way mansion (I guess she stole a bunch of money, too?), he suddenly has a change of heart. This is, of course, weird. 47 even having a heart is rather out of character, given his generally machine-like personality. He goes through with the assassination, but suddenly he's willing to toss aside his duties to the Agency when he learns that the girl Diana had absconded with is some kind of genetically engineered Indigo Child.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Suddenly, everyone's out for 47's head, and he's on the run. It's an interesting change of pace for the series, which has largely kept you focused on individual jobs as part of a larger plot, as opposed to one continuous flight without breaks in-between. Here, there are no mission load-outs, no preparations to speak of ahead of your next mission. You're going from place to place, sometimes absent any weapons (including your patented Silver Ballers, which get taken away in multiple scenes), just looking for whatever's useful to you in order to get to your target.</p><p style=\"\">It's a neat approach only somewhat kneecapped by the general stupidity of the plot. In order to get 47 into some of those situations, he has to do some remarkably dumb things that seem wildly out of character for him. Granted, it's probably not easy trying to conceptualize ways to put a man so incredibly rooted in routine and precision out of his element, but Io mostly skips the hard parts of that process by just making him fall for brazenly obvious traps or attack guys he has absolutely no business attacking.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112562/2317941-saints_contract_kill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2317941\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56146179401993\" data-width=\"602\" style=\"width: 602px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112562/2317941-saints_contract_kill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2317941\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112562/2317941-saints_contract_kill.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dear Io Interactive: We get it. You like Robert Rodriguez movies. Can we not do this again?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Io plays with a lot of different concepts throughout the story, mixing sci-fi, action movie, and grindhouse tropes into a kind of over-flavored slurry. It introduces too many characters, many of which are largely incidental in the grander scheme of things, and sometimes are just plain distracting. You've undoubtedly seen or heard about the trailer featuring 47 smoking a bunch of sexy nuns with automatic weaponry. Those nuns are in the game, yet only for a couple of scenes and never do much of consequence, save but to act as more highly trained bad people for you to dispatch. Why <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\" slug=\"square-enix\">Square Enix</a> even bothered to pay Vivica A. Fox the money to voice the lead nun is bizarre, but then, this is the company that also paid <a data-ref-id=\"3040-102399\" href=\"/emma-stone/3040-102399/\" slug=\"emma-stone\">Emma Stone</a> to voice a barely-remembered girlfriend character in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29441\" href=\"/sleeping-dogs/3030-29441/\" slug=\"sleeping-dogs\">Sleeping Dogs</a>, so who knows?</p><p style=\"\">Fortunately, there are also multiple memorable villains to work against that don't require sexy nun costumes to be interesting. Travis, the slovenly, perpetually angry Agency head, is voiced with snarling, slurring aplomb by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-100874\" href=\"/powers-boothe/3040-100874/\" slug=\"powers-boothe\">Powers Boothe</a>. And then there's Blake Dexter, a rootin', tootin' South Dakota arms dealer who actor Keith Carradine plays a bit like a mix of Christoper Walken in <i>The Rundown</i> and the Texas oilman from <i>The Simpsons</i>. Dexter is an amazing combination of sociopathic disregard and narcissistic opulence. He's basically a hilarious Bond villain, complete with his own freakishly huge bodyguard, who appears to have been genetically engineered into a cross between Danny Trejo and Giant Gonzalez.</p><p style=\"\">These villains largely take the place of your usual contract kills. The in-game targeting system still works largely as you'd expect, plopping you down in the middle of an environment, and tasking you with finding a way to dispatch your targets with as little collateral damage as possible. These levels are still the playgrounds of death you may remember from the earlier games, though in several instances they do feel a bit more confined. More interestingly, some aren't really even about assassination. In several instances, you'll find yourself simply trying to escape an area without being detected. In those cases, discretion is the better part of valor, though incidental kills can be made without failing the mission. Instead, your end-of-level score diminishes with each non-target kill.</p><p style=\"\">This is the crux of the Hitman: Absolution experience. You kill, you're scored for it, and you move on. In most cases, getting a high score isn't exceptionally difficult, as the AI has a tendency toward the dumber side of the spectrum, and will often let you get away with little foibles that would probably get you immediately arrested or murdered in real life. That never quite goes away, even on the higher difficulty levels, though it does improve.</p><p style=\"\">47 is also aided by instinct, a new, drainable meter that takes effect at the press of a button. Enacting instinct lets 47 see the enemies around him, even through walls and on other floors. It also acts as a way to help blend into the crowd. Pressing the instinct button allows you to walk past those who might see through your disguise, while simultaneously draining the meter. Instinct also fuels your \"point shooting\" mechanic, which is essentially just the sort of \"point, tag, shoot\" mechanic that's been showing up with increasing frequency in modern shooters. It's handy, though, albeit sometimes a bit too effective.</p><p style=\"\">For those who come to Hitman games simply looking for creatively elaborate ways to kill, Absolution offers myriad delights. Every mission has a collection of solutions to sift through, many of which won't seem terribly obvious on your first play-through. Fortunately, Absolution is a game that invites replays, even while you're in mission. Checkpoints are set up in such a way that I rarely found myself having to replay too many sections when I died, or was simply unsatisfied with the result of my actions. Yes, it's trial and error, but it's Hitman's brand of trial and error that's always been there. If anything, I found Absolution easier to get into than many of its predecessors.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227422-8774hopeplumberservice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227422\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227422-8774hopeplumberservice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227422\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227422-8774hopeplumberservice.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227422-8774hopeplumberservice.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Contracts mode lets you design your own missions for other players, with either an eye for the challenging or the absurd.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Playing through the campaign will likely take you between 10 and 20 hours, depending on play style and difficulty. Each mission is generally bite-sized enough to warrant multiple plays for higher scores and discovering more unlockable disguises and weapons. You'll want those too, since they can be used in the new Contracts mode.</p><p style=\"\">Contracts is Absolution's multiplayer, and it is a minor gem. Asynchronously, players can compete against one another in missions effectively designed by the players. Sure, you're using the already included missions as templates, but you're picking the target. It can be anyone in a given mission, and the ways you can customize how players must proceed is quite cool. You can determine what disguise a player must wear, and even exactly how the target must be killed. Completing Contracts missions gives you more in-game money to spend, as well as leaderboard scores.</p><p style=\"\">Though you don't need to get into Contracts to enjoy Hitman: Absolution, it helps. The campaign can be a lot of fun, but not every mission is a winner, and Io's hokey plotting does it no favors. Still, Absolution is a distinctive game, both visually and mechanically. It feels like its own thing, while still hewing toward many of the concepts people grew to like about this series over the years. And now those concepts have been put in a competitive arena that's as fun as anything the series has done in single-player since the series' inception. Longtime Hitman fans will undoubtedly be put off by some of the changes Io has made here, but if you're willing to dig a little deeper, you'll find a game that's as rewarding as any Hitman prior.</p>", "deck": "Hitman: Absolution tries a few things differently than the games that came before it.

At least at the outset, it's unclear why or if the rest of the world is grappling with the same reality. You are wandering the streets aimlessly until a voice identifying himself as The Prepper calls out, and offers shelter in his safe house. The Prepper does not identify himself, but he does promise you a way to defend yourself and a place to call home. You will return to the safe house often to pick up a new mission from The Prepper, drop off spare equipment, upgrade weapons, save progress, and generally take a deep breath. The safe house is not zombie-proof, but it's one of the few reliably protected places in the whole game. Saving and upgrading can take place in remote safe houses, as well, and you'll unlock manholes that serve as fast travel shortcuts around London.</p><p style=\"\">\"You\" is purposely vague in ZombieU, as \"you\" are a random survivor, and \"you\" will become another random survivor when you die--which you will. Often, actually, and it will totally suck every single time. Though ZombiU does assign a name and profession to each survivor, it's meaningless data, and no individual backstory is ever fleshed out. The only time you hear survivors speak is when they're screaming in terror. This is fine, since ZombiU's story is all about your actions as the player. Though ZombiU does tell a perfectly serviceable story with a memorable spin on the reason zombies showed up, the moments I was telling others about had nothing to do with it. Instead, I would describe the time I tried to lay down a landmine near a pack of zombies, alerting them in the process--and the mine went off in my face. <i>Dead</i>. Instead, I remembered when I was crossing rickety, thin wooden planks in the sewer, zombies spawning on both sides of me, and as I attempted to deal with them, I fell. <i>Dead</i>. Instead, I recall picking a lock on the GamePad, which pans the camera out on the TV to provide a look at what's happening around you, and watching as a zombie slowly fell out of a nearby vent. <i>Not dead!</i> I managed to pick the lock, and close the door behind me.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2321784-zunycscreenshotsupermarketcrickettime.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2321784\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2321784-zunycscreenshotsupermarketcrickettime.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2321784\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2321784-zunycscreenshotsupermarketcrickettime.jpg\"></a><figcaption>One-on-one confrontations should be easy, but it doesn't take much to mess up in ZombiU.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Death has consequence in ZombiU, borrowing inspiration from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-760\" href=\"/fromsoftware-inc/3010-760/\">FromSoftware</a>'s notoriously difficult <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2169\" href=\"/souls/3025-2169/\">Souls</a> games and bringing in at least some of its sense of permanence. After dying in ZombiU, you respawn as a new survivor in The Prepper's safe house. All of your equipment is gone, and any skill progression earned from firing guns has vanished. The game offers you one opportunity to return to where you died, kill your previous self, and loot that equipment. Die a second time, however, and that body, along with any hard-earned equipment, disappears forever. When you die because of careless movement and take too much fall damage, it's not the end of the world. Be cautious and calculated, and you'll get all that stuff back. When you die amidst a pack of zombies and <i>you</i> have now become an additional enemy, it's soul crushing. I had one survivor make it nearly three hours, but I never found his body. I gave up, moved on. Clearing out a room of zombies with nothing more than a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1913\" href=\"/cricket-bat/3055-1913/\">cricket bat</a> and a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-59\" href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\">pistol</a> with a few bullets can take the better part of an hour, and it's easy to mess up. There are a few stats that carry from survivor to survivor, though. Weapon upgrades are permanent, and you can modify weapons at workbenches found in the safe house and around the world. Early on, I piled all my upgrades into the base level pistol, since every new survivor is granted one, and handgun ammo is one of the more common items.</p><p style=\"\">Other players may have an easier time than I did, since most of my playthrough happened before Wii U's day one patch, which introduced its suite of online services. In ZombiU, players on your friends list and randoms connected to the Internet will populate the world after dying in their game. You're not actually playing with these people at the same time, per se, but if they die in their Buckingham Palace, their infected body is now part of your Buckingham Palace. The same is true for you. Random zombies do not carry much on them, but survivors are likely to have much more of what you need: ammo, medkits, and guns. The game keeps track of these deaths on the GamePad, and if you find yourself low on equipment, it's easy enough to identify where a friend recently died and go searching for their corpse. Creepy? Sure. Invaluable? Hell yeah. You may also leave \"messages\" for others throughout the world, ala the Souls games, but you cannot leave written messages, and must communicate through confusing symbols that say very little. One imagines this is to avoid players just leaving keypad numbers in the environment (discovering the numbers is one of the few puzzles the game offers), but it hamstrings what could have been an interesting feature.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Getting to those corpses will require extreme patience, a virtue ZombiU asks for often. This is not a fast paced game, and playing it that way is a great way to get killed. ZombiU punishes overzealousness. Its not-so-great shooting mechanics will rub some the wrong way, but it felt thematically consistent with the amateurish nature of the survivors themselves. Once you learn how the system works, you adjust. It's a jarring transition, but give it time--it will click.</p><p style=\"\">There are two constants in ZombiU: your flashlight and cricket bat. Ammo will disappear, medkits will be applied, and flares will burn out, but your flashlight and cricket bat remain. The flashlight drains as it's used, but flipping it off will bring the battery back to full in seconds. There are no other melee weapons in ZombiU, and it would be easy to groan at the lack of variety, but like many design decisions in ZombiU, it's one with purpose. You cannot just wind up a swing with the cricket bat in perpetuity until a zombie approaches. Each swing must be deliberate, and perfectly timed. In some cases, enemies will have helmets that render them invulnerable until you've knocked it off. To that end, only having access to the cricket bat ensures you become intimately familiar with the timing of an individual swing, how long it takes before you can pull off another one, and work to establish rhythm of swinging, then moving, then swinging to employ proper crowd control. Over the dozen or so hours you spend with ZombiU, its reliability becomes a comfort. Conserving equipment is vital to longterm survival in ZombiU, and that means ample use of the cricket bat whenever possible.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2324696-zombiuloot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2324696\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56225528582616\" data-width=\"1277\" style=\"width: 1277px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2324696-zombiuloot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2324696\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2324696-zombiuloot.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2324696-zombiuloot.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The interaction between the GamePad and TV is put to good use throughout ZombiU.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">To get this far without mentioning ZombiU's use of Nintendo's GamePad controller says much about how well it's implemented. Besides having you flip it up in order to activate gyroscope-based sniping (also controllable using the analog sticks, thankfully), it's good. It's largely used for inventory management, and at the start of the game, you have precious few slots to manage. (You gain more slots if you manage to find larger backpacks.) There are six quick use items, and the rest are stored in your backpack. The lack of an <a data-ref-id=\"3045-121\" href=\"/ipad/3045-121/\">iPad</a>-level touch screen with multitouch means you have to be very careful and deliberate with your finger presses on the GamePad, but in a funny way, that falls perfectly in line with the rest of the game. When you do something, don't do it half-assed. Opening the backpack does not pause the game, leaving you extremely vulnerable, and unable to attack enemies. If you're mucking around in your backpack in the middle of a fight, though, you fucked up, and blaming the touch screen's finickiness is just placing the blame somewhere other than yourself.</p><p style=\"\">When not moving items around, the center of the screen is home to an invaluable radar system that's upgraded throughout the game. At first, when a button is pressed on the screen, it cans the area and blips red (think <i>Aliens)</i> if zombies are nearby and moving. An upgrade makes that pinging automatic. This radar is both your friend and enemy, as it is not always telling the truth. Crows and rats will show up, too, making a room appear to have somewhere in the range of 10 to 15 zombies…when there's really only one. Not funny, game! Pressing a trigger, however, prompts the survivor to hold up the device in the world, and it becomes a scanner on the GamePad's screen. The scanner can identify if zombies are carrying items, differentiate between a crow and a zombie, and save you the headache of scavenging through every part of the world for equipment. It'd easy to imagine how the radar could have just become a mini-map in the corner of the TV screen, but there is something to the idea of actually diverting your eyes from the TV to gain additional information from the radar. Doing so in the middle of a fight with several zombies is terrifying but important, especially if you're trying to survive with only the cricket bat, but the moments where I looked away and screwed up my swing are burned into my mind. The radar becomes an X factor, and how often you invite the risks of looking at it will largely depend on the play style you establish.</p><p style=\"\">There's multiplayer in ZombiU, as well, but it's more interesting than it is enjoyable. The main mode finds the GamePad user becoming <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20690\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3030-20690/\">Left 4 Dead'</a>s <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2539\" href=\"/ai-director/3015-2539/\">AI Director</a>, dropping zombies into the world for the survivors controlled by other players to fight. In single-player, the shaky shooting controls and slow <a data-ref-id=\"3015-444\" href=\"/melee/3015-444/\">melee</a> combat work just fine, but it doesn't translate to multiplayer very well. It's also one-on-one, and would benefit from supporting more players. It's just not much fun with just two players.</p><p style=\"\">All of these words later, and I've somehow said nothing about how damn scary ZombiU is. I played <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30087\" href=\"/amnesia-the-dark-descent/3030-30087/\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> this year, and ZombiU gave that one a run for its money. You feel alone in ZombiU, often fighting and scavenging in total darkness. Your flashlight provides little useful illumination, and the moments where it runs out, forcing you to recharge while a zombie shuffles towards you, are paralyzing. The 30 minutes I spent in a nursery are some of the most memorable time I've spent with a horror game or movie, punctuated by a jump scare that literally took my breath away. Survival horror fans disenchanted with the direction <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\">Capcom</a>'s taken the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-397\" href=\"/resident-evil/3025-397/\">Resident Evil</a> series will find much to love in ZombiU, and anybody looking for a quality launch title with deep, rewarding mechanics are encouraged to see what Ubisoft--yes, Ubisoft-has created.</p>", "deck": "ZombiU is not a repeat of Red Steel.

The comic is still going strong over 100 issues in, and the TV series loosely based upon it, despite some serious second-season hiccups, is finding new life in its third season. All this, despite an overwhelming sense of malaise related to all things zombie in pop culture these days. Granted, zombies are pretty much everywhere, and while they make for serviceable villains in just about any context, there are only so many ways you can stab, shoot, bludgeon, beat, kick, squash, crunch, or set alight the undead. They're always going to be screeching, gurgling ghouls who want to eat you, and the thrill of killing them can really only take you so far.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2374255-walkingdead101_2012_07_02_22_31_35_04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2374255\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2374255-walkingdead101_2012_07_02_22_31_35_04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2374255\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2374255-walkingdead101_2012_07_02_22_31_35_04.png\"></a><figcaption>Lee Everett is as completely realized a playable protagonist as I can ever remember playing...</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is what makes <a data-ref-id=\"3010-397\" href=\"/telltale-games/3010-397/\">Telltale's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34205\" href=\"/the-walking-dead/3030-34205/\">The Walking Dead</a> such a marvel. Seemingly aware that the mere act of killing zombies is hardly enough to capture anyone's attention nowadays, lead writer/directors <a data-ref-id=\"3040-92998\" href=\"/sean-vanaman/3040-92998/\">Sean Vanaman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-84932\" href=\"/jake-rodkin/3040-84932/\">Jake Rodkin</a> have smartly focused the game on the human story of the zombie apocalypse. This is certainly in the tradition of Kirkman's writing of the comic books, but this Walking Dead tale is arguably even more gripping than Kirkman's own works. This Walking Dead puts you right in the middle of the fray as society buckles under the weight of the dead rising, and forces you to make tough decision after tough decision not only to survive, but to help others survive as well.</p><p style=\"\">Split up over five episodes, the first season of The Walking Dead puts you in the shoes of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-22614\" href=\"/lee-everett/3005-22614/\">Lee</a>, a convicted murderer who may or may not actually be all that bad of a guy. You don't know, because the game is purposefully vague about your back story, perhaps so as to allow some malleability in how players see themselves. Lee is you, but Lee is still a character who speaks, emotes, and has his own distinct personality. That his dialogue choices in nearly every scenario allow for a range of responses means you can mold Lee to your play style. He's essentially a silent protagonist with a voice, if that makes any sense at all. That his voice can be so easily adjusted to your own style is a compliment to the writing, which is as mature and thoughtful as anything I've played in recent memory.</p><p style=\"\">Over the course of the five episodes, Lee is joined by a variety of other survivors of the zombie apocalypse, some of which stick around for the duration of your journey, and some who simply appear for an episode or two and then are dispatched, either of their own volition, or by way of some grisly demise. One character who is a constant is <a data-ref-id=\"3005-22615\" href=\"/clementine/3005-22615/\">Clementine</a>, an eight-year-old girl who Lee stumbles upon in her otherwise abandoned suburban home early in the first episode. When you meet her, Clem is just a particularly vulnerable survivor, completely alone and terrified. Her parents were out of town when the outbreak hit, and until you come upon her, she'd barely had any human contact. No matter how you play Lee, it becomes apparent that this child is going to become your responsibility.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">And what a wonderful, heart-wrenching responsibility she turns out to be. It is with no amount of exaggeration that I say that Clementine is one of the most fully-realized, brilliantly written child characters ever put into any kind of entertainment medium. Children are often impossible to write, given their innocence, capriciousness, and general inability to understand the world around them. Make them too dumb, and they become a shrill annoyance. Make them too clever, and they become cartoon characters. Clem is neither of these things. She is a kid who is at once capable, but deeply unsure of herself. She, like Carl from the <i>Walking Dead</i> comics, is forced into a situation where she must grow up entirely too quickly. That her upbringing into this ludicrously dangerous world is your responsibility is a gamble by the game's writers that brilliantly pays off. Not only do you want to protect this girl, you want to help her every way you possibly can. When that safety is threatened, it's not just Lee's on-screen anger that resonates. You feel it too.</p><p style=\"\">What you have to do to keep her safe becomes increasingly grotesque and horrifying as the season wears on. Much as the comic rarely shied away from making characters do terrible things to survive, the game forces you to make constant life or death choices that can easily result in characters you like dying terrible deaths.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12444/2303203-gun.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2303203\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12444/2303203-gun.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2303203\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12444/2303203-gun.jpg\"></a><figcaption>...but the real gem of this story is Clementine, a character I cared far more about than I ever thought possible in a game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Choice. It's an interesting buzzword in gaming that too often boils down to a meaningless, binary path selection. If I choose A, I get this ending, and B, this other ending. The Walking Dead has these moments, but more often choice comes in the form of smaller decisions that nonetheless can have grave impact on your ability to move forward. Even your choice of tone in dialogue with other characters can have an effect on how other characters react to you in subsequent episodes. You can be the selfless hero, the selfish dick, or some amalgamation of the two. Regardless, those choices will add up over time.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, the main story is always going to play out the way it's going to play out. While you can affect endings, who lives or dies, and how people interact with you, the truth is that the larger scope of the story is very much out of your hands. After all, this is a work of fiction, and as a result your choices still have to work within the machinations of the game's (apparently huge) script. In a sense, The Walking Dead is almost like an examination of fatalism. You can choose whatever path you like, but in the end, the larger world around you is going to do what it's going to do. All you can truly hope to affect is how you get to that end, and how you spend your time with others who may or may not be fated to survive.</p><p style=\"\">Those choices prove a remarkable source of tension in a game that already has plenty of walking, slobbering, biting sources of tension. Ultimately, The Walking Dead treats its zombie antagonists the way the comic and TV series has--a deadly nuisance. Zombies are sentient weeds to be plucked, or simply walked around. That makes them no less dangerous, mind you, and the game certainly has plenty of breath-holding moments featuring Lee and other characters struggling against hordes of the undead. But more often, the tension comes from interactions with other people, be they fellow friendly survivors, or unfriendlies who regrettably cross your path. The choices you're forced to make in how you deal with these people is The Walking Dead's greatest fount of dread and terror. Even simple dialogue choices often left me pondering far longer than I ever expected.</p><p style=\"\">To dig too deeply into the individual choices you will make is to dig up too many potential spoilers. Suffice it to say, each episode requires some tough thinking, and no matter what you choose, not everyone will survive. In this regard, Telltale's traditional episodic structuring is something of a blessing. Trying to play the entirety of season one in a single sitting is an incredibly draining experience. Emotions run high throughout each episode, which individually clock in between 90 minutes to three hours apiece. Each story is like its own individual tale, spun as part of a larger anthology. The second episode, for instance, is practically a self-contained story featuring multiple characters who never reappear, but nonetheless have a great deal of effect on what happens afterward. The writing and voice acting remains sharp throughout. Though some episodes are certainly better than others, there isn't a bad one in the bunch.</p><p style=\"\">What's interesting is that very little about what makes The Walking Dead so special comes from the act of actually playing it. There's no secret sauce here that differs from Telltale's other point-and-click adventure games, save for the copious amounts of blood everywhere. You're still exploring environments, solving light puzzles, and occasionally engaging zombies that get a bit too close. But those mechanics are simple, generally uninvolving, and only occasionally frustrating. If anything, the choices and dialogue trees are the core of The Walking Dead's gameplay. Everything else is just necessary machinery to make it go.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5294/2237989-wd_ep2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2237989\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5294/2237989-wd_ep2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2237989\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5294/2237989-wd_ep2_7.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5294/2237989-wd_ep2_7.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zombies are always a looming threat, but it's the living people you've really got to watch out for.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Sometimes that machinery does falter, though only rarely. Though the game's cel-shaded art style looks terrific on every platform, the console versions of the game are definitely prone to frame hitch-ups and occasional crashes, at least in my experience. I did most of my playing on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\">PC</a>, which generally seems to be the best version, though some players have reported issues with saves wiping between episodes on that platform. I never experienced this myself, but it's been reported pervasively enough that I feel it warrants a mention. This is one of those cases where I feel the quality of content is worth the risk of potential technical hurdles, no matter which platform you choose to play on.</p><p style=\"\">Yes, The Walking Dead really is that incredible. Relying so heavily on the writing, atmosphere, and emotional content of a game to carry you through a five-episode season is a risk that has paid tremendous dividends for Telltale. The Walking Dead is no mere interactive story. It is an immaculately paced, painfully affecting story featuring some of the most lovingly crafted characters ever to appear in a video game. From the very beginning, The Walking Dead sinks its teeth in and never lets you go. It's a journey in the truest sense of the word, replete with tragedy, heartache, tension, fear, and even brief moments of catharsis. Calling The Walking Dead a work of entertainment almost seems like a misnomer, considering the heavy tone and general lack of sentimentality in the writing. This is a sad game that will weigh heavy on you long after you've completed it--it even wrung some honest tears out of me on a couple of occasions. But you'll suffer through the emotional swings because they're ultimately worth it. No matter how depressing, gut-wrenching, or flat-out horrifying The Walking Dead gets, you will want--nay, <i>need</i>--to finish it. It's just that good.</p>", "deck": "The Walking Dead's first season is nothing short of a masterpiece of modern horror gaming.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-549/", "platforms": "PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-34205/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-walking-dead/3030-34205/", "id": 34205, "name": "The Walking Dead"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-11-26 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-116347/", "id": 116347, "name": "The Walking Dead - Episode 1"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/playstation-all-stars-battle-royale-review/1900-550/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/164408/2359197-2012_11_03_145733.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2359197\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/164408/2359197-2012_11_03_145733.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2359197\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/16/164408/2359197-2012_11_03_145733.jpg\"></a><figcaption>PaRappa is one of the older (and better) characters on the roster.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I don't know that I'd call <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38140\" href=\"/playstation-all-stars-battle-royale/3030-38140/\" slug=\"playstation-all-stars-battle-royale\">PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale</a> an ambitious game.

It carves out its own fighting style in the margins, but make no mistake--this is a highly derivative game. That's not necessarily a bad thing, of course, though PlayStation All-Stars makes a couple of design decisions that make the whole thing feel a little more awkward than it should. Also, for a game that's supposed to bring together the greatest heroes of the PlayStation platforms, it's missing too many key figures.</p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-368\" href=\"/crash-bandicoot/3005-368/\" slug=\"crash-bandicoot\">Crash Bandicoot</a>. Let's just get it out of the way up front, OK? I'm certainly not privy to whatever backdoor dealings went into securing (or not securing) characters for this game's roster, but if you're making a game that attempts to bring together the classic <a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" slug=\"playstation\">PlayStation</a> players and you don't have the system's first big mascot, someone has already screwed up. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those weirdo Crash Bandicoot fiends or anything, and I'm well aware that Sony doesn't actually control the rights to the Crash Bandicoot property (through a series of mergers and sales, he belongs to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a> these days), but it's an embarrassing omission. While we're at it--and I'm sure those of you at home have already played along by filling out your own dream roster--it's difficult to talk about stand-out characters from the PlayStation era without bringing up <a data-ref-id=\"3005-321\" href=\"/cloud-strife/3005-321/\" slug=\"cloud-strife\">Cloud Strife</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-195\" href=\"/lara-croft/3005-195/\" slug=\"lara-croft\">Lara Croft</a>. These three characters typify the early days of Sony's console business. Even though they aren't Sony characters, they're the characters that brought Sony to the dance and helped make the PlayStation <i>the</i> must-own platform through the back half of the '90s. If you catch me on the right day, I might even go so far as to say that if you can't lock down those three characters for your Sony fighting game, you probably shouldn't make your Sony fighting game.</p><p style=\"\">The roster isn't all bad, though. The Sony-controlled standards from the modern era are present, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-120\" href=\"/ratchet/3005-120/\" slug=\"ratchet\">Ratchet</a> (with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-323\" href=\"/clank/3005-323/\" slug=\"clank\">Clank</a> in tow), <a data-ref-id=\"3005-548\" href=\"/jak/3005-548/\" slug=\"jak\">Jak</a> (with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-549\" href=\"/daxter/3005-549/\" slug=\"daxter\">Daxter</a>, natch), <a data-ref-id=\"3005-645\" href=\"/kratos/3005-645/\" slug=\"kratos\">Kratos</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-162\" href=\"/nathan-drake/3005-162/\" slug=\"nathan-drake\">Nathan Drake</a>, and not one, but <i>two</i> version of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6399\" href=\"/cole-macgrath/3005-6399/\" slug=\"cole-macgrath\">Cole</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1704\" href=\"/infamous/3025-1704/\" slug=\"infamous\">Infamous</a>. That he gets two squares on the select screen instead of a \"press triangle to select <i>Evil</i> Cole\" treatment says to me that the developers were struggling to fill out that roster, but perhaps I'm projecting. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-761\" href=\"/parappa/3005-761/\" slug=\"parappa\">PaRappa</a> is in, and he's maybe the perfect mix of a known character that's still worth getting nostalgic about. You also get a set of also-rans that are too new and underused to feel classic, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-755\" href=\"/nariko/3005-755/\" slug=\"nariko\">Nariko</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"3005-755\" href=\"/nariko/3005-755/\" slug=\"nariko\">Heavenly Sword</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11379\" href=\"/colonel-mael-radec/3005-11379/\" slug=\"colonel-mael-radec\">Col.

These aren't franchise players, and while it's cool to dig deep, these guys aren't distinguished enough to feel like meaningful inclusions. Instead they feel like warm bodies, there to pad out Sony's end of the roster.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79498/2259965-7517011930_e6e68cd863_z.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2259965\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79498/2259965-7517011930_e6e68cd863_z.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2259965\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/79498/2259965-7517011930_e6e68cd863_z.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Each background busts apart at a set interval to reveal parts of another game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game feels a little heavy on third-party characters, which is entirely sensible. Sony has always enjoyed firm support from third-party developers, and many of the best PS1 and PS2 games don't have SCEA's name on the box. But instead of focusing on the greatest names from PlayStation history (see above!), the inclusions here feel like a bunch of co-marketing deals masquerading as guests in a fighting game. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-309\" href=\"/dante/3005-309/\" slug=\"dante\">Dante</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32686\" href=\"/devil-may-cry/3030-32686/\" slug=\"devil-may-cry\">Devil May Cry</a> is here, but it's the new Dante. Say what you will about that redesign, but of the two Dante designs that are out there, only one of them could safely be referred to as an \"All-Star\" right now. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-347\" href=\"/raiden/3005-347/\" slug=\"raiden\">Raiden</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26801\" href=\"/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/3030-26801/\" slug=\"metal-gear-rising-revengeance\">Metal Gear Rising</a> is here. There are two <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32317\" href=\"/bioshock-infinite/3030-32317/\" slug=\"bioshock-infinite\">BioShock Infinite</a>-themed backgrounds, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-624\" href=\"/big-daddy/3015-624/\" slug=\"big-daddy\">Big Daddy</a> appears on the roster. You know, Big Daddy from BioShock, that huge <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a> hit... that shipped like a year later than the PC and 360 versions? Instead of leveraging its past, the roster keeps an eye toward future releases. It makes a sizable chunk of the game feel like a series of ads instead of a love letter to the PlayStation brand.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame that this aspect of PlayStation All-Stars sticks out so much, because once you get past the roster and its lackluster story cutscenes, Battle Royale is a fun little game. It's a chunk of frantic action that blends button mashing with meaningful strategy, even if that strategy comes from a slightly strange set of systems. All-Stars is all about your three-level super meter, and your sole goal is to build that meter up and unleash it at the appropriate times. Landing a super on an opponent is the sole way to kill that opponent and earn points. By default, your overall total at the end of a match is kills versus deaths, with two points earned for earn time you kill an opponent and one subtracted each time you fall to an opposing super. So, in a sense, waling away on another fighter has no direct impact on that fighter. But indirectly, it's key, because while you're landing attacks you're earning more meter and your victim, who's just standing there and taking your attacks, isn't. Throws and a couple of other attacks give you an opportunity to steal some of another player's super meter, too.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">This means that the game really comes down to your knowledge of a character's super attacks and how best to land (or avoid) those attacks. So what the game lacks in moment-to-moment monitoring of a damage meter it makes up for in a multitude of \"oh snap!\" moments when the supers start popping off. Some of these attacks, particularly the low-level ones, feel like they come out of nowhere, so when Parappa runs up behind the other three fighters and busts out a flash kick that kills all three players, it's <i>rad</i>. When Raiden does a breakdancey little spin kick that takes out foes on either side of him before you can figure out what was happening, it's the sort of thing that makes a couch full of players start shouting up a storm. It's chaotic fun. The higher level supers get flashier and are more in line with a character's unique style, so <a data-ref-id=\"3005-981\" href=\"/sly-cooper/3005-981/\" slug=\"sly-cooper\">Sly Cooper</a> gets a little sniping sequence that feels like it fell out of one of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-352\" href=\"/sly-cooper/3025-352/\" slug=\"sly-cooper\">Sly Cooper</a> games. Sweet Tooth turns into a giant robot. Kratos goes nuts and starts swinging a sword that kills in one-hit. The bigger attacks are more stylish and pretty interesting, but I always felt like I was doing better when I was slipping into range and busting out my low level supers on unsuspecting players.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/164408/2359200-2012_11_03_151210.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2359200\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/164408/2359200-2012_11_03_151210.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2359200\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/16/164408/2359200-2012_11_03_151210.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/16/164408/2359200-2012_11_03_151210.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The differences between the PS3 and VIta versions are minimal.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">For a game that should be bursting at the seams with personality and charm, PlayStation All-Stars sure has some drab, plain menus. Once you're actually inside the game and fighting, things look fine but a little basic. The flashy super combos are certainly over-the-top, but the baseline action looks like a bunch of tiny dudes scurrying around and a bunch of little hit flashes. This ends up being worse on the Vita, since it's a smaller screen to begin with, but even on the PS3 I was picking myself out on-screen by the big player number text that floats above each character's head. All of this action is set on a series of mash-up backgrounds that start out based on one game, but transition into another. These transitions are the same every time, though, so seeing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2699\" href=\"/chop-chop-master-onion/3005-2699/\" slug=\"chop-chop-master-onion\">Chop Chop Master Onion</a>'s dojo bust apart so a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-405\" href=\"/killzone/3025-405/\" slug=\"killzone\">Killzone</a> robot can invade the stage is surprising and cool precisely once. More randomness in the stages would have made this stuff way cooler.</p><p style=\"\">The single-player side of All-Stars is very slim, but a lot of what's there seems to be focused on getting you to understand the game's fighting style and, ideally, train you up to be a better online fighter. The online works great on both the PS3 and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-129\" href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" slug=\"playstation-vita\">Vita</a>, with a ranked mode that's broken up into \"seasons,\" giving players multiple chances to be at the top of a season's leaderboard. And, if you buy the game on the PlayStation 3, you get access to the Vita version for no extra charge. I ended up preferring the default control scheme on the Vita over the PS3, even though the Vita version awkwardly requires you to tap the screen to pick up items during a fight. It's also worth noting that if you know that you only want a portable version of the game, you can get that on its own for $20 less than the console/handheld bundle.</p><p style=\"\">PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale is an interesting first attempt at bringing Sony's characters, stages, and items together in the traditional Smash Bros. style, but it fails to carve out enough style of its own along the way. It ends up being an interesting, if occasionally awkward \"party\" style fighting game that works a little better than you might think. But it also feels like a proof-of-concept that misses too many classic PlayStation figures and moments to truly earn the title \"All-Star.\"</p>", "deck": "This frantic fighting game just doesn't pack in enough PlayStation flavor to truly earn the title of \"All-Star.\"", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-550/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38140/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-all-stars-battle-royale/3030-38140/", "id": 38140, "name": "PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-11-27 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-116529/", "id": 116529, "name": "PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/adventure-time-hey-ice-king-whyd-you-steal-our-gar/1900-551/", "description": "<p style=\"\">There is perhaps no property on television more deserving of a good video game adaptation than Pendleton Ward's <i>Adventure Time</i>. After all, the tweens, adult nerds, and stoners of all ages who enjoy <i>Adventure Time</i> are constantly peppered with references to video games of yesteryear, an era Ward clearly has a great deal of affection for. So when presented with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-37763\" href=\"/adventure-time-hey-ice-king-whyd-you-steal-our-garbage/3030-37763/\" slug=\"adventure-time-hey-ice-king-whyd-you-steal-our-garbage\">Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!</a>, you'd be right to be excited. An <i>Adventure Time</i> video game co-written by Ward himself, developed by noted retro game enthusiasts <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2294\" href=\"/wayforward-technologies/3010-2294/\" slug=\"wayforward-technologies\">WayForward</a>, and featuring a design modeled after a classic <a data-ref-id=\"3025-9\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda\">Zelda</a> game? It practically sounds like a dream project for fans, which is why the end result of Hey, Ice King! is perhaps more of a disappointment than it would be were it simply another unremarkable licensed game destined for the bargain bin.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2369851-at11.15.2012ikgarbage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2369851\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2369851-at11.15.2012ikgarbage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2369851\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2369851-at11.15.2012ikgarbage.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Ice King's desperate weirdness doesn't quite play as comically in text as it does when voiced by Tom Kenny.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Please do not mistake my meaning. In nearly every facet of its design, Hey, Ice King! is a completely competent action adventure game that seemingly has its designs most squarely focused on younger players. It's a lightweight adventure that sees the series' two main protagonists--confirmed human <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16715\" href=\"/finn-the-human/3005-16715/\" slug=\"finn-the-human\">Finn</a>, and the unnervingly elastic dog <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16716\" href=\"/jake-the-dog/3005-16716/\" slug=\"jake-the-dog\">Jake</a>--setting out on a quest to find out why vile series antagonist <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16831\" href=\"/ice-king/3005-16831/\" slug=\"ice-king\">Ice King</a> has stolen their garbage. \"It's just garbage!\" you might be shouting, if you're not a regular watcher of the show. But fans know that Ice King's obsession with princesses and the kidnapping of them is usually at the root of anything he does, which means that Jake and Finn must spring into action...even if it just means they're rescuing a princess constructed out of their own refuse.</p><p style=\"\">Over the course of the adventure, you'll travel to a few different places on the map of Ooo, including the Candy Kingdom, Jake and Finn's bad ass tree house, and of course the icy mountains in which Ice King dwells. You'll also run into dozens upon dozens of familiar characters, ranging from the obvious to the obscure. No, not <i>everyone's</i> there, but considering this show introduces about six new characters per episode, that might be a bit much to expect.</p><p style=\"\">The script for Hey Ice King! was co-written by Pendleton Ward, so it's no surprise that the show's distinct flavor of stream-of-consciousness weirdness is prevalent throughout. And yet, I often found myself missing...<i>something</i>. I found myself more often just mildly chuckling at the jokes in the game, versus the more laugh-out-loud quality of the show. I think it might have something to do with the lack of voice work. <i>Adventure Time</i> is a show that features tremendous voice actors like <a data-ref-id=\"3040-31075\" href=\"/tom-kenny/3040-31075/\" slug=\"tom-kenny\">Tom Kenny</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-76140\" href=\"/john-dimaggio/3040-76140/\" slug=\"john-dimaggio\">John DiMaggio</a> saying tremendously silly things, and while you get snippets of their voices during specific conversation sections, most of the dialogue is just written. So much of what makes <i>Adventure Time</i> funny is the hyperactive goofiness of the characters and their interactions. You lose some of that in just reading the jokes.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Which isn't to say I'd expect a <a data-ref-id=\"3045-117\" href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" slug=\"nintendo-3ds\">3DS</a> game to feature a full suite of spoken dialogue, mostly due to the obvious hardware limitations. But in lieu of an adventure that captures the full essence of the show, I'd at least hope the gameplay would pick up the slack. It doesn't.</p><p style=\"\">It's not that Hey Ice King! plays particularly poorly. In fact, it's a relatively polished little game, fully functional in its design and cleverly laid out across wonderfully diverse looking worlds. The problem is what you end up doing over the course of the adventure, which ultimately amounts to very little. Again, this is a game that was designed with younger players in mind. Unfortunately, that translates to combat that borders on mindless, and quests that tend to involve a good bit of fetching.</p><p style=\"\">I can handle a few fetch quests, but Hey Ice King!'s overworld design does it no favors. Taking more than a few cues from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16241\" href=\"/zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link/3030-16241/\" slug=\"zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link\">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a>, you'll be traveling around Ooo on a larger map full of dungeons, towns, and other landmarks. Often times you'll have to descend into a dungeon to get to other areas, meaning you'll be entering the same areas again and again. That would be fine, except that you have to fight the same enemies every single time you do this. Which, again, <i>could</i> be fine, except that the combat is so simplistic that it just becomes a bothersome chore to have to avoid/kill all these same bad guys again.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2348064-at_screen_10.18_jakesheild.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2348064\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2348064-at_screen_10.18_jakesheild.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2348064\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2348064-at_screen_10.18_jakesheild.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's a decent little adventure in Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!, but it feels like it should be better than that.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's worth noting that things do pick up toward the second half of the game, as you discover new items and earn new abilities for Jake, whose elastic nature becomes progressively of more use. The trouble is, the game more or less ends right around the time you finally start feeling good about things. By the time the combat becomes more interesting and the dungeons finally become suitably challenging, you're pretty much at the last boss fight. This is a game you could pretty easily complete in about four or five hours, if you're not being super meticulous in your hunt for secrets and other obscure items.</p><p style=\"\">All of this said, I can hardly bring myself to outright dismiss Hey Ice King!, especially for the more die-hard fans of the show. Whatever lackluster components it has almost lose out to the smiles one tends to get when seeing the sheer amount of visual detail poured into this game. Ooo is lovingly rendered here, and the character art and animation is really sharp. Unfortunately, visuals aren't everything, and the actual act of playing Hey Ice King! is something that cannot be ignored. Tempering your expectations, you may find Hey Ice King! to be an entertaining little diversion, especially if you're a younger player or just looking for an excuse to spend some time with your favorite characters from the show. Regrettably, those hoping for something a bit more involving from a gameplay perspective just aren't going to find it here.</p>", "deck": "Hey Ice King! is a game with its heart in the right place, but it's a bit too simple, and too fleeting to leave a lasting impression.

The succession of story missions presents an uneven mix of great outdoor setups--where the kind of unpredictable mayhem and destruction inherent to open-world games prevails--and a few too many basic corridor crawls, which end up feeling a bit like a slog and are not where this game excels. The best part of Far Cry 3 is when you're running around out there in that enormous open jungle environment, where just about anything can happen. With pirates, mercenaries, native rebels, and both docile and predatory animals all going about their business (and constantly getting in fights with each other), a host of controllable vehicles from ATVs to trucks to hang gliders, an entire arsenal of military-grade weapons hardware at your disposal, and the ability to set practically everything on fire, hilarious and unique events aren't just an occasional delight, they're the norm.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2363694-ss_c5c810244ba6dd899de44121b37d87fad2621d4c.1920x1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2363694\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2363694-ss_c5c810244ba6dd899de44121b37d87fad2621d4c.1920x1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2363694\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2363694-ss_c5c810244ba6dd899de44121b37d87fad2621d4c.1920x1080.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The free-form combat really encourages you to play the way you want.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Far Cry 3 takes some concepts whole cloth from other great open-world games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-38\" href=\"/assassins-creed/3025-38/\" slug=\"assassins-creed\">Assassin's Creed</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25249\" href=\"/red-dead-redemption/3030-25249/\" slug=\"red-dead-redemption\">Red Dead Redemption</a>, but it's easy to look past the direct inspirations since the lifted elements just make this game way more fun. You'll need to climb and fix up a number of disabled radio towers, each of which acts as a unique platforming challenge unto itself, to reveal the surrounding map and side missions. Getting those transmitters back online also adds more guns to your ever-growing arsenal. Hunting and gathering herbs are important early-game activities, since you can craft the resulting items directly into better equipment and power-up items, and it's just fun to stalk your prey in the underbrush--and things get ridiculous quick when it turns out a tiger has been stalking you at the same time. There's even a leveling system and a full three-way skill tree that lets you spec out your character in ways that cater to the way you like to play. You'll probably end up with all the skills unlocked by the very end of the story, because Far Cry 3's prevailing ethos seems to be about making sure you're having fun in the open world as much as possible. All of these elements combine to give you a constant feedback loop of character progression that makes it really rewarding to get out there and do as much of this stuff as possible. Some of the formal side missions are pretty simplistic and don't stay entertaining for long, but there's so much else to do out there that you're not likely to get bored in this game.</p><p style=\"\">Enemy-held checkpoints--one of the weakest points of Far Cry 2, due to their neverending stream of respawning enemies--become maybe the best part of Far Cry 3, since they're now a formal type of side mission. The enemy-tagging mechanic of the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14782\" href=\"/far-cry/3030-14782/\" slug=\"far-cry\">Far Cry</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-268\" href=\"/crytek-gmbh/3010-268/\" slug=\"crytek-gmbh\">Crytek</a>'s subsequent efforts with the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-665\" href=\"/crysis/3025-665/\" slug=\"crysis\">Crysis</a> series, is especially useful here since you can now tag an enemy on the fly just by aiming at him for a second, and once he's tagged, you can see his movements clearly through walls. Each one of the roughly three-dozen outposts on the island thus becomes its own little self-contained combat puzzle, which you can approach from any angle and deal with however you want, whether by picking off enemies from a distance with a silenced sniper rifle, going in with a blaze of gunfire, or sticking the guards in the back with some amazingly fun combo takedown moves, better versions of which you unlock as you level up. There are even two levels of bonus experience if you manage to clear out an entire outpost without alerting anyone. Taking over outposts is one of the most interesting things to do in the game all the way up to the end, and they just get more satisfying the more special attacks you've unlocked.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's a good thing Far Cry 3 gets so much mileage out of just about every aspect of its gameplay, because by the time the credits rolled I felt extremely let down by the squandered potential of the plot. At the outset, the game goes out of its way to stress what a pampered scaredy cat Jason is, but then never justifies why he's immediately able to skin animals, operate high-level military hardware, and gun down hundreds of soldiers like some kind of special forces survivalist. The game repeatedly relies on that tired old video game cop-out, the dream sequence, to avoid actually having to address major plot points, which usually leaves you asking \"What the hell just happened?\" But you never find out. And the story has a fundamental problem with momentum. There's a protracted sequence in the middle made up of repeated fetch quests, and the whole thing really starts to run out of steam in the last third or so, after it prematurely wraps up some story threads that should have formed the basis of the entire game right up to the climax. The only reason I care enough about the story's failures is because it's so darn good early in the game, and if it had matched that quality evenly through to the end, we'd probably be talking about this as one of the best games of this entire console generation.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2294483-farcry3gc2012_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2294483\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2294483-farcry3gc2012_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2294483\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2294483-farcry3gc2012_03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2294483-farcry3gc2012_03.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You'd be surprised how often the wildlife does your job for you.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You sure can't accuse the game of lacking for content, though. In addition to the massive open-world story mode that you could spend dozens of hours in, there's a healthy suite of multiplayer modes too. The developers set out to include a full cooperative campaign that's more than a little similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3025-1342/\" slug=\"left-4-dead\">Left 4 Dead</a>, right down to the four stereotypical characters (such as an Eastern European mobster and a <i>Trainspotting</i>-esque Scottish hoodlum) you can play as. There's a neat story justification for all this, with a lengthy CG cutscene setting the whole campaign up, and the things that happen in the co-op campaign tie into the world the game creates in a reasonably clever way.</p><p style=\"\">The scenarios in the co-op campaign are linear, standard first-person shooter affairs that don't offer the sort of open, varied gameplay that the main campaign is so good at. You're basically moving from one area to the next, fighting off a bunch of enemies, and occasionally completing some objective. There's some amusing variety here and there, though, like a sequence where all four players are positioned up on a ledge and can only use an unlimited supply of grenades to take out a horde of enemies rushing in (and a player ranking afterward awards bonus experience based on how well you did). There's quite an elaborate loadout and class system here that lets you unlock not only new weapons and attachments but basic passive bonuses and even some team area-of-effect buffs like you'd see in an MMO. That leveling system also carries over to a perfunctory competitive multiplayer mode replete with its own leveling system, unlocks, and ability to prestige. It's fine that this mode is in here if you're really looking to wring as much time out of this game as you can, and there's even a pretty easy-to-use map editor in here if you want to make a map where you dig a big hole in the ground and fill it with sharks. But none of this stuff is required for me to recommend Far Cry 3. The game more than justifies its existence with the single-player mode alone.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/2380136-farcry3_d3d11_2012_12_02_02_24_33_88.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2380136\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/2380136-farcry3_d3d11_2012_12_02_02_24_33_88.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2380136\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/2380136-farcry3_d3d11_2012_12_02_02_24_33_88.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/2380136-farcry3_d3d11_2012_12_02_02_24_33_88.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The player progression makes it really satisfying to keep doing side activities and leveling up.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You'd be remiss when talking about Far Cry 3 not to mention <a data-ref-id=\"2300-6839\" href=\"/quick-look-far-cry-3/2300-6839/\" slug=\"quick-look-far-cry-3\">how good this game looks</a> on the PC, with the sort of DirectX 11 features that will stress any hardware currently on the market. I had plenty of those \"Wow, games look like <i>this</i> now?\" moments while creeping through the brush or sailing over the island on a hang glider. It also scales quite well; I was able to get perfectly acceptable performance out of my nearly three-year-old machine at home on above-average settings, though I was having so much fun with the game that I couldn't resist upgrading my video card just to max it out. The console versions retain a surprising amount of the PC version's fidelity, down to the density of the island's foliage and the shafts of sunlight peeking through tree branches, but they do so at a <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-far-cry-3-face-off\" rel=\"nofollow\">terrible cost</a> to the frame rate. The game is generally playable, and if you haven't seen the PC version you won't know what you're missing, but with performance well below 30 frames per second that dips down to 20 or worse in the heaviest action, you shouldn't play this game on a console unless you have no other choice. Even a modestly equipped PC will offer a much better experience.</p><p style=\"\">Ultimately, Far Cry 3 left me a little conflicted. It's a smartly designed open-world game with a ton of stuff to do, and the random acts of hilarity that occur out in the jungle will constantly leave you with unique stories you'll be desperate to tell your friends. If the story had made good on the strength of its initial premise, Far Cry 3 would have been shoo-in for best game of the year. As it stands, it's still the most fun I've had in an open world in ages, a game that plays so well and looks so good, I wish every other piece of it reached the same high bar. But you should play it anyway.</p>", "deck": "Even when Far Cry 3's story eventually falls short of its promising start, you won't have as much fun hunting tigers, crashing hang gliders, and stabbing pirates in any other game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-552/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32933/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/far-cry-3/3030-32933/", "id": 32933, "name": "Far Cry 3"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-12-04 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115948/", "id": 115948, "name": "Far Cry 3"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/family-guy-back-to-the-multiverse-review/1900-553/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Great news, racists, misogynists, homophobes, and generally terrible people!

If you simply don't have the time or mental capacity for \"jokes\" with \"punchlines,\" then by all means, engage Back to the Multiverse for its liberal use of insults and offensive words for what I can only assume was a half-cocked attempt at shock value. Then again, shock value would also imply that you could actually be shocked by any of this stuff. If anything, the only shocking aspect of Back to the Multiverse is how haphazardly said offensive terms are doled out over the course of the game's brief adventure.</p><p style=\"\">While there is a story in Back to the Multiverse--which features <i>Family Guy</i> stalwarts <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1372\" href=\"/stewie-griffin/3005-1372/\" slug=\"stewie-griffin\">Stewie</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3464\" href=\"/brian-griffin/3005-3464/\" slug=\"brian-griffin\">Brian</a> teaming up to save the world from a dimension-hopping villain baby--it largely plays second fiddle to the simple act of running around an environment filled with some minority or another, shooting everything in sight, while frequently repeating lines from the show.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Yes, there is a lot of recycled dialogue in Back to the Multiverse, most of it unremarkable, barely-remembered one-liners from its main characters. You can tell the difference between what's old and what's new by the fact that the old lines occasionally feel like they were part of a larger joke. The new dialogue doesn't even know what a larger joke is. If it takes more than ten seconds to set up, deliver, and forget about, Back to the Multiverse doesn't even bother.</p><p style=\"\">With that said, I don't know that Back to the Multiverse was so much \"written\" as it was \"hastily slapped together,\" but no matter, because the most important thing is that you're being horrible to those that are probably different from you. The game literally opens with a rapid-fire assault highlighting the grossness of Greek people and the sluttiness (and requisite daddy issues) of sorority chicks, and then dovetails into a lovely little level-length treatise on handicapped people and their terrifying sense of entitlement.</p><p style=\"\">To be fair, not all of Back to the Multiverse is obsessed with calling things queer and the hilariously slutty antics of women. Later in the game, things move into more decidedly bizarre territory, featuring long stretches where you're killing Secret Service agents tasked with protecting Mayor McCheese, and space chickens that behave similarly to the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4530\" href=\"/xenomorph/3015-4530/\" slug=\"xenomorph\">Xenomorphs</a> from <i>Alien</i>. So there's your referential humor, I guess, if that's what you're after.</p><p style=\"\">Regardless of who you're killing for what reason, you will do it with haphazard shooting mechanics that qualify as functional, if utterly uninvolving. There's no real challenge to Back to the Multiverse. You'll die if you get shot up, but unless you've completely run out of the game's collectible currency, you'll always start right back where you got shot. Well, until the last few levels, which inexplicably have a tendency to start you way further back than seems reasonable. But otherwise, you're just running around, blasting wildly until everything's dead.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2371454-012721.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2371454\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2371454-012721.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2371454\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/2371454-012721.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some might think that Back to the Multiverse is just emblematic of its source material, but it's not. The TV series looks nuanced, compared to this garbage.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Keep in mind that Back to the Multiverse's gameplay design isn't really set up for anything more strategic than that. The mechanics function more like a lousy arena shooter than a typical third-person adventure, so there's a lot of running and shooting, and not much else. If we were talking about a game with a challenge level similar to, say, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-373\" href=\"/serious-sam/3025-373/\" slug=\"serious-sam\">Serious Sam</a>, that might have worked out better. But Back to the Multiverse isn't interested in challenging you so much as it is killing time until its next offensive one-liner.</p><p style=\"\">This all makes a bit more sense when you try out Back to the Multiverse's barely existent multiplayer. Yes, there's two-player co-op in the campaign, but if your desire to force Back to the Multiverse on people requires more sacrifices, there are offline deathmatch and \"capture the greased-up deaf guy\" modes to play around with. Incidentally, all relevant humor in the \"capture the greased-up deaf guy\" mode can be found in the title \"capture the greased-up deaf guy,\" so really, you don't even have to play it to get the joke.</p><p style=\"\">If you're the sort of person who doesn't inherently find the concepts of greased-up deaf people, Amish people commenting on their sex lives, older women grotesquely demanding group sex from frat boys, people in wheelchairs falling over, or \"the gays\" completely hilarious, do not get angry at Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse. This is not a game that deserves your anger. If it in any way felt deliberate, focused, or frankly invested in its own sense of humor, then maybe it would be deserving of such ire. As it is, Back to the Multiverse is a game that those with any modicum of taste should simply forget ever happened. To attempt to highlight its existence beyond a mere blunt dismissal is to give it entirely too much credit. Which I suppose I just did.

Everything in this new game exists in service of making it a great game in its own right, not in stoking your nostalgia for the games you played over the last decade. As a character action game, it hits all the notes--fast, robust action, marvelous visual style, and a tremendous sense of attitude--you could want in this type of game.</p><p style=\"\">To be fair, on paper, everything about Devil May Cry sounds like the tritest video game pap: a bloody war between angels and devils, endless hordes of demonic enemies straight from your favorite '80s heavy metal album art, and all of it punctuated by Scandinavian \"hellektro\" outfit Combichrist's thudding soundtrack. And then there's Dante, remade in the image of a club-kid layabout who's so sneeringly self-satisfied he defies any attempt you might make to identify with him. I pretty much went into the game consciously expecting to hate all of this, or at least view it as the sort of eye-rolling embarrassment video games are usually so good at delivering.</p><p style=\"\">Then, oddly, I started feeling a guilty pleasure at how much I was actually enjoying the spectacle. Then later I gave up the guilt and just flung myself wholeheartedly into the cyclone of nonsense. I think it became easy to like Devil May Cry because it seems somewhat aware of itself; the game is so damn <i>committed</i> to having fun with its absurdity, you can't help having fun along with it. Dante may be a smirking wiseass, but his lines are witty enough and delivered with so much panache, you quickly grow to like him anyway. And he makes a great foil for his brother Vergil, who's more of an uppity, refined ideologue fighting the good fight against the demons. Dante talks a constant stream of shit to Vergil and just about anyone else who gets in his way, and there's something uncomfortable and a little dissonant about a 50-foot ancient grub-demon screeching \"FUCK YOOOOOUUUUU!!!\" right back at him. The best sort of dumb fun is the kind that knows how dumb it is, and I consistently got the sense from Devil May Cry knew that the entire time I was playing it.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2211911-6868fd6195693ea9ce317ce1b3e59ade.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2211911\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2211911-6868fd6195693ea9ce317ce1b3e59ade.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2211911\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2211911-6868fd6195693ea9ce317ce1b3e59ade.jpg\"></a><figcaption>When acting is required, it's amazing how effective real actors can be.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game also knows when to rein it in, though.

Where Enslaved had a lot of heart, Devil May Cry offers an equal amount of middle finger, but it still manages to lend an appreciable level of gravitas and some occasional poignance to its tale of saving the world from demons who have enslaved the human race with... soda. As before, the success at selling you on the plot simply comes down to all the subtle eye movements and shoulder shrugs and skilled line reads that add up to real, believable performances, the kind of thing you get when you go into a performance-capture facility and fill it with people who can, you know, act. That the characters here do so much to uplift Devil May Cry's ridiculous premise is a testament to both the capability of performance-capture technology and Ninja Theory's use of it.</p><p style=\"\">Lest we forget this is also a video game: Devil May Cry is in fact a greatly entertaining character action game, as fast-paced and diverse as I could have wanted. The game starts you off with Dante's familiar sword and dual pistols, but you quickly start to collect angel and demon weapons, which fill light and heavy attack categories respectively. Switching between melee weapons, and the three firearms you end up with, just takes a tap of the d-pad. You only have a single attack button which wields your sword by default, and you switch to the equipped angel or devil weapon instantly by holding the left or right trigger and hitting that same button. The game finds a lot of interesting ways to make you stay on your toes, with enemies that only fully coalesce when one type of weapon is equipped, or floors that will hurt you if you aren't holding the same-colored weapon. More importantly, if you're quick enough, it's possible to involve three, four, or five different weapons in a single combo, and the game is constantly running a tally on the side of the screen rating how stylishly you're fighting, all the way up to triple-S.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The more style you rack up, the more new abilities and moves you can unlock (from a list of dozens), and since you lose a couple of letter grades every time you get hit, you're really incentivized to play as cleanly as possible. The combat isn't overwhelmingly hard on the default difficulty, though it isn't a cakewalk, but if you're really serious about this kind of game, play it on hard from the outset. There are another four difficulty levels waiting for you to unlock them after that. The game is built to be replayed repeatedly; you can jump back into any mission on any difficulty whenever, and there are plenty of places you just can't access without the right abilities the first time through. All of your completion totals get rated and slapped onto leaderboards if you want to keep up with how your friends are doing. In short, the between-mission trappings, the glue that holds the levels themselves together, feel thoroughly modern in this game.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2226463-dmc_e3_2012_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226463\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2226463-dmc_e3_2012_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226463\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2226463-dmc_e3_2012_6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2226463-dmc_e3_2012_6.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The inventive visual and level design just keeps on coming.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Since all the action takes place in a demonic mirror world called Limbo, the designers get to go wild with the sorts of places you're fighting in, and the game is constantly turning your expectations (and the levels) upside down by placing you in skewed, exploded, or otherwise deconstructed versions of city streets, mansions, night clubs, and a few more unlikely environments I'll leave to you to discover. While this sort of level design has started to feel a little played out since games like <a data-ref-id=\"3040-12964\" href=\"/american-mcgee/3040-12964/\">American McGee's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2681\" href=\"/american-mcgees-alice/3030-2681/\">Alice</a> made it popular ages ago, I was constantly surprised and delighted by the sheer, over-the-top inventiveness of the levels in this game. There's also a degree of grappling-hook-style traversal, and a few creative moments that emphasize the relationship between Limbo and the real world, that make the game feel like more than a constant stream of enemy encounters. And the game is absolutely awash in dazzling visual presentation. I won't go too deep into that, because it's better absorbed firsthand, but the broad and ever-changing color palette, the ways the level geometry explodes and deforms around you, the titles and overlays that pop up on the screen to enhance the action, all combine to make this game a great venue for its artists to display their talents.</p><p style=\"\">I brought no personal baggage to Ninja Theory's take on Devil May Cry, having played and enjoyed the original game way back when but then steering clear of the series after its poorly received second entry. Whether you're a longtime fan (with an open mind) or a total newcomer just looking for a solid character action game, it's hard to imagine anyone feeling overly dissatisfied with this new game. It's almost wholly successful at what it tries to do, and seems like the start of a promising new direction for what was otherwise a nearly forgotten franchise.</p>", "deck": "The character action genre hasn't been this stylish or crazy in a good long while.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-554/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32686/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dmc-devil-may-cry/3030-32686/", "id": 32686, "name": "DmC Devil May Cry"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2013-01-14 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117236/", "id": 117236, "name": "DmC Devil May Cry"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-cave-review/1900-555/", "description": "<p style=\"\">At its best, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-2859\" href=\"/ron-gilbert/3040-2859/\">Ron Gilbert</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2215\" href=\"/double-fine-productions-inc/3010-2215/\">Double Fine Productions</a>' <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38390\" href=\"/the-cave/3030-38390/\">The Cave</a> is an intriguing oddity. It's the closest thing I've seen to a straight-up morality play in a video game, a sort of cautionary tale of greed, lust, hatred, and whatever other deadly sins you can dream up, told through the mechanics of a classic side-scrolling adventure. And at times, that concept actually proves interesting. There are more than a handful of moments in The Cave where the mechanics, the odd storytelling structure, and the game's visual style all cohere into something a little bit wonderful. Unfortunately, it's the other portions of the game you'll be spending more time with, and they're a bit less entertaining.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2213582-cave04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2213582\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5609375\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2213582-cave04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2213582\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2213582-cave04.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Cave is a dangerous and violent place. Yet, no aspect of it is more vile than the protagonists who seek to plunder it.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Built with the skeletal structure of a classic 2D adventure game, The Cave largely eschews that genre's tendency toward larger, overarching narrative, and instead focuses squarely on the bite-sized tales of seven protagonists, each of whom have come to the eponymous cave for fame, fortune, or some other manner of selfish pursuit. You can only pick from three of the available characters--who include, among others, a money-hungry scientist, a jauntily wrathful hillbilly, an aggressively lazy monk, and a pair of creepy, murderous twins--and once you have your team assembled, you'll have to individually navigate them all through the myriad nooks and crannies of the cave.</p><p style=\"\">The Cave employs a story structure that allows its individual character stories to be woven into a larger level progression. Many sections of the game play out every time, regardless of who you choose. But in between those sections are whole levels tailored to specific characters. These are where your team's individual stories of grave robbing, parricide, or timeline altering chicanery play out.</p><p style=\"\">All the while, a narrator eggs you on, pointing out the various character flaws and misdeeds of your misbegotten spelunkers like an omnipresent Rod Serling. In the game's fiction, this voice <i>is</i> The Cave. It is a cave with consciousness, personality, and sarcastic opinions. This is where the bulk of the game's comedy comes from, given that none of the playable characters ever speak. Mostly it's cute, clever stuff, though I can't say it ever elicited more than a few chuckles out of me. More often it's the kind of funny you acknowledge for being funny, rather than the kind you laugh out loud at.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Granted, I'll chalk at least some of that non-laughter up to my concentration on the game's puzzles. Each section of The Cave is replete with traditional adventure game puzzles. Acquiring and combining items is often the key to progression, though which items go where is often obfuscated, as one might expect. Some puzzle sections are unquestionably tougher than others. The knight character, for instance, offers up a mostly breezy level section that only requires a bit of navigational attention be paid. The time traveler, however, jumps between periods in time and offers up the kinds of causality-related puzzles that often lead to people just hating things with time travel in them.</p><p style=\"\">Again, many of these puzzles are clever, challenging little buggers, but not unpleasantly so. Only the time traveler section really goes off the deep end, whereas the other levels often just require some solid critical thinking and understanding that every object and highlighted area is usually there for a reason.</p><p style=\"\">The unfortunate side-effect of The Cave's level designs, however, is that they're often incapable of keeping up with the player's brain. Too many of The Cave's puzzles are solved by repeated backtracking. Which isn't to say that the environments are too huge to quickly run through again and again, but that makes it no less tedious. Especially after you've had your \"aha!\" moment, and find yourself having to run back and forth several times, including sections where you have to get all three of your characters into just the right place, before you can actually proceed. That last issue is negated somewhat when playing the game's offline-only coop mode (in which the camera still only focuses on one character at a time). But the disconnect in time between realizing the solution and actually bringing the solution to fruition still frequently feels overlong. In this regard, it can be difficult to really get into a rhythm with The Cave.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2308964-cave3b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2308964\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/2308964-cave3b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2308964\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/2308964-cave3b.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The art and comedy of The Cave certainly fit snugly into the traditions of the Double Fine catalog. It's just not their most engaging work.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game's multiple-playthroughs-required design doesn't necessarily help this problem. While I did have fun going back and checking out the new levels I had access to on my second playthrough, I was less enamored with having to play through the non-character-specific areas I'd already done. And I don't expect I'll be going back for a third go-around, either, due to the odd numbering of characters available. Having to replay two stories really doesn't sound appealing enough to warrant checking out that last one I haven't seen.</p><p style=\"\">Which is a shame, because on my initial play-throughs, I enjoyed large swaths of what The Cave had to offer. It's a sharp-looking game, the voice acting is largely on-point and funny (if occasionally obnoxiously repetitive), and there are at least a few solid hours worth of puzzle-solving to be had here. It's just that those hours don't really add up to a whole lot in the grand scheme of things, ultimately relegating The Cave to an interesting curiosity that sadly doesn't have much sticking power. Its moral finger-wagging never really amounts to more than thematic window dressing, regardless of how you end up finishing the game, and its puzzles are just intriguing enough to keep you interested for the duration. There is most certainly fun to be had in The Cave. I just wish its promise of an eminently replayable adventure ultimately proved truer.</p>", "deck": "Ron Gilbert's lightweight morality play offers up some cleverness and challenge, but never completely coheres into a memorable whole.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-555/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38390/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-cave/3030-38390/", "id": 38390, "name": "The Cave"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-01-22 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-122980/", "id": 122980, "name": "The Cave"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dead-space-3-review/1900-556/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2427620-ds3_08_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427620\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2427620-ds3_08_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427620\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2427620-ds3_08_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Chill out, brah!

The game's first few hours set it up as an interesting and worthy sequel built around the series' fantastic signature combat, but the deeper you get, the more Dead Space 3's repetitive levels and enemy encounters, shoddy storytelling, and general lack of refinement start to wear on you.

Meanwhile, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1197\" href=\"/isaac-clarke/3005-1197/\">Isaac Clarke</a> is off shirking his responsibility as The One Guy Who Can Stop All This by drinking himself stupid in a dingy apartment, until a couple of meatheaded soldier types (one of whom awkwardly becomes your co-op buddy) show up to forcibly drag him into saving the human race. After a most ill-conceived opening chapter that has you running through an exploding city and getting into firefights with human soldiers, things start looking up, and the game assumes a brisk, entertaining pace for a few hours as you move into a stint on an ancient flotilla of derelict battleships, in orbit around an uncharted planet that bears profound significance to the Marker epidemic.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2427621-ds3_09_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427621\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2427621-ds3_09_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427621\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2427621-ds3_09_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Most of the efforts at drama fall resoundingly flat.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While you're out there in space, picking your way through the haunted corridors of those warships, it's easy to remember what's great about Dead Space. The combat is as satisfying and brutal as ever, there's a decent bit of mood and a good number of effective jump scares, and you get to do some amazing spacewalks around the exterior of the ships, using your kinetic engineering powers to put equipment back together. And after a few hours spent reactivating generators and repairing shuttles and investigating the fate of the crew, the robustness of the new crafting feature starts to come into focus. You're limited to two weapons at a time, down from the previous games' four, but the crafting makes up for that by letting you tweak and combine massive amounts of functionality into a single weapon slot. The crafting rests on a resource system that initially feels too complex for its own good; you'll need some time before you can tell your transducers from your semiconductors from your somatic gel. As you're absorbing all this, it's easy to feel disgusted at the option to skip the effort and just buy those resources direct from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1\" href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\">EA</a>, and by the scavenging robots you can deploy to bring back materials in bulk, provided you're willing to wait for a 10-minute timer to tick down. Or five minutes, if you're willing to buy a $5 DLC \"accelerator.\" But eventually it's just as easy to ignore all the DLC and microtransacted nonsense completely, since you'll be swimming in crafting resources and able to build whatever you want by the end of the game if you just stay on top of deploying the default robots. That only feels a <i>little</i> like busywork.</p><p style=\"\">You'll also start to dig into Dead Space 3's optional side missions while you're out there in orbit, and that's another new aspect of the game that starts off looking mighty promising. There's a little service vehicle you can use to ferry yourself at will between a handful of mostly intact ships, some of which don't contain anything relevant to your next story objective, but might be emitting some signal that bears investigating. In a few cases, you can elect to put off the next story mission in favor of exploring one of those other ships, where you'll find some light story touches that help fill in a little context around the nature of the fleet and the planet below, and then invariably open a cornucopia of crafting materials at the end. Those first couple of side missions train you to assume all the subsequent ones will be worth your time, and by the point when I'd handled all of my business with the fleet and headed planetside, the game had gotten into an entertaining rhythm of alternating story missions and side quests, all driven by the sort of carrot-on-a-stick character progression that propels you to eagerly keep pushing forward.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2364979-ds3researchfacility012.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2364979\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2364979-ds3researchfacility012.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2364979\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2364979-ds3researchfacility012.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2364979-ds3researchfacility012.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Co-op is here and functional if you want it.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, I felt like the overall quality of the game began to cool rapidly the longer I spent on that damn ice planet. For one thing, physical setting aside, Dead Space 3's visual design is just drab. Remember how wildly varied the second game's environments were, how masterfully crafted its atmosphere? The frozen mausoleum, the overrun civilian shopping district, the gothic gloom of the Unitologist church: you always had some masterfully lit new area to marvel at. This game has two modes: industrial-military interior, and snow. The repetition goes beyond visual design, as the game engages in the cardinal sin of copying and pasting the same specific rooms over and over to pad out its level design. I lost count of the number of times I fought a bunch of enemies in the exact same explosives storage room, and while the problem gets so bad in the side missions that eventually I wished I'd stopped playing them, it also bleeds into the core story areas enough that everything just starts to run together after a while. There's also far less variety and creativity in the design of the enemy encounters than I remember from the last two games; after a few hours I felt like I could predict exactly when necromorphs were going to burst out of the air ducts, and exactly which ducts they'd come out of. There aren't a lot of new enemies, and even many of the series' old enemies are barely represented, as you'll spend the vast bulk of your time fighting the same handful of fodder necromorphs over and over... and over.</p><p style=\"\">Some aspects of Dead Space 3 just don't feel up to snuff from the get-go. The last two games knew that horror, tension, and gore were their bread and butter, and wisely filled their storytelling in around the edges of the those core elements without letting it get in the way. As the last game of the trilogy, this one feels way too concerned with spelling out all the answers to the Marker questions, and too often it does so with hammy dialogue, implausible character motivations, and poorly devised subplots. A corny love triangle, for instance, does absolutely nothing to enhance the best aspects of Dead Space, and the game's handling of Unitology is downright disappointing. The cultish religion used to provide a vague backdrop of lunatic conspiracy to the desperate struggle with the Markers, but it's now been reduced to a sneering villain with a British accent who commands a legion of riflemen and suicide bombers. These elements stumble and crash along awkwardly as the game progresses until you arrive at the end of it all, where the final revealed truth about the whole thing struck me as completely ridiculous. The production values that support all of this are also rougher than I've come to expect from this series. Character animations in cutscenes sometimes look a bit robotic and stilted, for example, and three times I had to revert to a checkpoint to fix an audio bug that completely garbled all of the dialogue. There are parts of this game where the art and level design come together to produce scenes that are absolutely top-notch, as good as you'll see in any game, but the presence of those outstanding moments is exactly why the bad parts are so irksome.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2427624-ds3_20_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427624\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2427624-ds3_20_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427624\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2427624-ds3_20_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2427624-ds3_20_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>No lie, the spacewalks are easily my favorite part of the game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As something close to a Dead Space purist, I resolved from the outset to play this game by myself until I finished it, but even taken as a pure single-player game, the cooperative earmarks are all over this campaign. You're constantly running into reminders that these levels, minigames, and action set pieces were designed for two people, since there's always two of everything everywhere you look. And Carver, the second player character, has a way of popping up in the story at some ridiculous times that both strain plausibility and also remind you that Dead Space was a lot cooler when it was just Isaac Clarke against the horde, not Isaac and some guy up on a ledge shouting at you about where to shoot the boss. Taken purely as a single-player game, Dead Space 3 enacts a ridiculous change in Carver's loyalties about halfway through the game, though if you play the three cooperative-only side missions, you do get some decent context about the guy's motivations, and some mildly interesting hallucination sequences to boot. It's a shame that content is locked behind a two-player requirement, though, and while you'll probably enjoy the option to play through the game with a friend if you like cooperative shooters, having another person there just serves to fully obliterate the game's already thin veneer of horror and tension.</p><p style=\"\">If you're a completionist, you have to commend this game for the explicit way it details every single collectible and ancillary mode on offer. There's an exhaustively detailed progress report that tells you how many logs, collectibles, weapon parts, side missions, and other piece of minutiae you've found or finished in every chapter, and further lets you know what sort of item or set you'll unlock for completing each category. The game wisely separates your character and weapon upgrades from your story progress, making it easy to jump back into earlier chapters to look for things you missed. And there's a fantastic variety of one-off difficulty modes after you finish the game once. In addition to the standard new-game-plus mode that offers better upgrade items, there's Classic, which disables co-op and limits you to weapons from the first game, and Pure Survival, where the only way to get ammo and health items is by crafting them. Then there's Hardcore, which lets you save as much as you want but forces you to start the whole game over if you die. At all. If you do end up liking the game (and I did like it, despite its faults), these sorts of modified difficulty types are a great feature to see.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Dead Space 3 incorporates some successful new ideas into its stock horror-action formula, and some segments of the game really impressed me, but it's hard not to feel disappointed by the weaker parts of its design. I'm still glad I saw the Dead Space trilogy through to the end--and if you're invested in the series it's absolutely worth playing--but it's too bad this respectable series, which felt so exciting and fresh when it debuted just a few years ago, had to go out on a middling note.</p>", "deck": "Dead Space 3 mixes some solid new ideas in with its stock horror-action tropes, but the overall quality of the production falls short of the series' standards.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-556/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38270/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dead-space-3/3030-38270/", "id": 38270, "name": "Dead Space 3"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-02-05 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117685/", "id": 117685, "name": "Dead Space 3"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/antichamber-review/1900-557/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5504/2426527-2013_01_31_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2426527\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5504/2426527-2013_01_31_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2426527\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5504/2426527-2013_01_31_00002.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Two simple staircases, but guess what? They both bring you to the same spot.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">People keep wanting to paint <a href=\"/antichamber/3030-32844/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32844\">Antichamber</a> as some sort of \"messed-up\" puzzle game, like it's wild and crazy. There's nothing particularly crazy about this first-person puzzle game. It actually adheres to a very specific set of rules and applies ice cold logic across all of its obstacles. The catch is that those rules and that logic don't even attempt to match up with what we use on a day-to-day basis out here in the real world. While there are specific sequences you'll need to solve, the larger puzzle in Antichamber is figuring out what, exactly, this world can throw at you and then remembering to try these techniques in the appropriate spots. It gets clunky in a few spots, and I certainly found myself in one or two cases where I felt like the game's attempts to communicate its own rules to players could be laid out more effectively, but by and large Antichamber is a wonderful game that employs a terrific sense of style to feel larger and grander than it would otherwise.</p><p style=\"\">Though it's rarely explicit about what it's showing you, Antichamber starts making its attempts to teach in the first minute or so with a set of staircases. One goes up, and one goes down, but no matter how many times you choose one of those two options, the pathways keep leading you to the same exact choice, again and again. But if you turn around and head the other way, you'll see that the path that led you into this choice is no longer the path at your back. This notion of things changing behind you as you move and the idea that rounding a corner might just warp you to a totally different section of the world without any indication is the crux of Antichamber. It's powerful, giving the game a dizzying quality that is only partially addressed by a map room that you can return to at any time. You'll have to start making note of your surroundings, both from the designs of the rooms you visit and the things you can hear while you're there, in order to get around.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93770/2419542-antichamber04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2419542\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93770/2419542-antichamber04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2419542\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/9/93770/2419542-antichamber04.png\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The game keeps loose track of your progress by showing off a wall full of tiles in the map room. These tiles show up around the world, and they're usually some sort of hint or comment on a nearby puzzle. So after a sequence where you need to fill in a series of empty holes with blocks to open a gate and proceed, you'll find a tile with a little pieces of art that reads \"understanding a problem requires filling in the pieces\" when you click it. These phrases are little more than simple platitudes, and if it wasn't for the occasional need to point players in the right direction or mark progress, the game would probably be better without them.</p><p style=\"\">Though early puzzles are all about movement and taking note of your environment, the game quickly changes once you collect the first brick tool. The brick tool is a gun that lets you collect cubes from around the environment. These cubes are stored in the tool and can be fired back out, letting you move them around as you see fit. Some doors need cubes to be fired into specific slots before they'll open. Sometimes you'll need cubes to block sensor beams that might shut a door if tripped. And, much like <a href=\"/portal/3030-21170/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21170\">Portal</a>, there are energy fields that will wipe out your entire supply of cubes, ensuring that you can't always go collect cubes from a nearby puzzle and bring them along with you to the next. Creatively using and conserving cubes is paramount in the early game, but there's more to the cubes than just that. Proceed further and you'll find upgraded versions of the brick tool that give you new abilities that trivialize the old ones. Without ruining the fun by getting into too much detail, it should suffice to say that the final version of the tool completely trivializes the puzzles you were doing near the beginning of the game. One might even call the final tool overpowered, but considering you've already learned so much by the time you've arrived at this nearly game-breaking upgrade, it instead manages to slip a slight bit of power fantasy into a game with no combat at all. It's a neat trick.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">If you like, you can simply make a beeline for the puzzles that lead to the various versions of the brick tool, meaning that a critical path trip through the game could take minutes, not hours. But that would require you to either already know the world of Antichamber like the back of your hand or... well, you'd just have to be very, very lucky. Even after completing the game, I found myself drawn to those last few puzzles that, even with the most powerful tool in the game, still somehow eluded me. As a game without any overt story, its conclusion is fairly brief, linking to its very short credit sequence and unceremoniously dumping you out to the desktop, an act that caused me to wonder if the game had crashed. All in all, the conclusion felt underwhelming, but the final few areas are really exhilarating and it all balances out just fine.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93770/2419543-antichamber06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2419543\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93770/2419543-antichamber06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2419543\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2419543-antichamber06.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2419543-antichamber06.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Make sure you have enough blocks.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Antichamber often left me in wonder over what I was seeing. Its sparse use of color on a largely white world is really striking, and it knows to break away from those plain white walls every now and again to show you something that looks dramatic, moving, and meaningful by comparison. That all matches up with a set of ambient sounds and effects that make it all feel like some sort of dream world. There are, however, a few cracks in that world as the technical end of Antichamber pokes through from time to time. The resolution on the text and little bits of art on the panels is low, making them look muddy and imprecise in a way that the rest of the game isn't. Also, it's a clever trick to put all of the sound and resolution settings on a wall in the map room, but laying everything out to fit on that wall seems to have left no room for resolutions higher than 1920x1200.</p><p style=\"\">Antichamber is a wonderfully pleasant experience that is best served in smaller chunks, which left me in my own personal nightmare: I was having such a great time that I felt like I wanted to continue playing, but I had used up all of my smarts for the evening, leaving me bumping up against puzzles that I wasn't even sure could be solved with the version of the tool I had at the time. Taking breaks and coming back to it a day, or even a few hours later, sufficiently recharged the puzzle-solving fluids needed to proceed, though. That and one of the various functions you earn as you upgrade your tool isn't explained as well as most of the game's other concepts, which left me needlessly stuck until I caught a glimpse of this new function while watching a few videos online. It's a rough spot in a game with few others, but those spots seem to pop up at the most inopportune times, leaving you with the feeling that this great game still has room to improve.</p>", "deck": "Antichamber's mindbending puzzles force you to learn the rules of an unfamiliar world and it makes for an exciting and thought-provoking time.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-557/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32844/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/antichamber/3030-32844/", "id": 32844, "name": "Antichamber"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-02-12 09:50:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115333/", "id": 115333, "name": "Antichamber (Steam)"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/aliens-colonial-marines-review/1900-558/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Many have chided Ridley Scott's recent sort-of-<em>Alien</em>-prequel <em>Prometheus</em> as a cynical, unnecessary retcon of the existing <em>Alien</em> canon that never quite justified its own existence. <a href=\"/aliens-colonial-marines/3030-20921/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20921\">Aliens: Colonial Marines </a>makes <em>Prometheus</em> look vital by comparison. <a href=\"/gearbox-software-llc/3010-1615/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\">Gearbox Software</a>, who were ostensibly in charge of the seven-year operation required to bring this thing to fruition, have spent much of that time talking about just how much they loved <em>Aliens</em>.

Maybe we shouldn't have done that.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In reality, the many years of development spent on Colonial Marines have resulted in a staggering misfire. Ugly, tedious, and frankly more than a little bit broken, Colonial Marines is not a game that offers you, the presumed <em>Aliens</em> fan, anything you wouldn't do just fine without. The game's idea of expanding on the timeline that exists between <em>Aliens</em> and <em>Alien 3</em> has never stood out as a particularly necessary one, but based on the aforementioned enthusiasm for the material, one couldn't help but hope that maybe the developers had some cool, unexpected ideas of how to flesh out that particularly nebulous period between film series protagonist <a href=\"/ellen-ripley/3005-8567/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8567\">Ellen Ripley's</a> escape from the <a href=\"/xenomorph/3015-4530/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4530\">xenomorph</a>-infested planet <a href=\"/lv-426/3035-1563/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1563\">LV-426</a>, and her arrival on the prison planet in <em>Alien 3</em>.</p><p style=\"\">They did not.</p><p style=\"\">Instead of thoughtfully fleshing out the existing canon, the developers instead chose to rewrite whole chunks of it just for the sake of making their dumb story fly. In the game, you arrive at LV-426 with a battalion of colonial marines who have come to find out what happened to the squads previously sent to the planet in<em> Aliens</em>. What they find is the <a href=\"/uss-sulaco/3035-3828/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3828\">Sulaco</a>, the derelict ship that once housed the movie's marines, floating around in space. It's been overrun with xenomorphs, as well as <a href=\"/weyland-yutani/3015-5134/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5134\">Weyland-Yutani</a> hired mercenaries, who have seemingly been conducting an operation on the planet and the ship. You, as marine Christopher Winters, begin the game by storming the Sulaco looking to aid your comrades in battle against the Wey-U soldiers and horrible creatures that have infested it, but eventually will end up back on LV-426, trapped in a much larger, and much stupider conspiracy than you'd ever dreamed.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">This is one of the biggest fundamental flaws of Colonial Marines, and one it shares with <em>Prometheus</em>. Namely, this game feels like it was built around its setpieces, and not the other way around. Granted, at least <em>Prometheus</em> grew out of the germ of an idea that was answering the question of who the giant \"Space Jockey\" was that the hapless humans of the original <em>Alien</em> stumbled upon. That question may not have had the most coherent of answers, but at least it made a half-hearted effort to answer <i>something</i>. Colonial Marines instead takes the Star Tours approach, picking key locations from<em> Alien</em> and<em> Aliens</em> for the player to arrive at and proceed to gawk toward, while building a hacky, totally uninteresting story around why the player has to go to those places.</p><p style=\"\">Lacking a coherent story direction, the game relies on its main characters to build up the drama. Unfortunately, we're saddled with Winters and a few other marine grunts who offer no identifiable personality outside of their endless recycled references to \"no marine left behind\" and patently unconvincing \"ooh-rahs!\" By the time the tatters of the team end up on LV-426, the game finally begins showing its hand, offering up ridiculous plot twists and poorly executed conspiracies that just add a giant pile of nonsense to the nifty, if somewhat vague premise of <em>Alien 3</em>. I cannot explain much beyond that without outright spoiling the game, but let's just say that a late-game cameo (that the game telegraphs in its opening credits) is one of the dumbest, most hamfisted twists in anything of <em>Alien's</em> canon. Yes, dumber than the entire <em>Aliens vs. Predator</em> franchise.</p><p style=\"\">The worst part is that it does this for no real reason other than the sake of having another character you recognize in the mix. The existence of <a href=\"/lance-henriksen/3040-61906/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-61906\">Lance Henriksen's</a> Bishop at least makes canonical sense since he's a mass-produced artificial lifeform, but all this cameo character does is show up, try to explain away his appearance by actively avoiding trying to explain away his appearance--they literally answer a key plot question by saying \"That's another, longer story...\"--and then proceed to do nothing of note or consequence for the rest of the game. It's a twist for the sake of a twist, and nothing more.</p><p style=\"\">In absence of proper storytelling, Colonial Marines must then rely on its gameplay to keep your attention. This is most unfortunate for a number of reasons. As a first-person shooter, Colonial Marines is at least a basically functional piece of work. The weaponry you're provided is neat and authentic, right down to the gunfire sound effects you remember from the movie. Yet, the action is deeply unsatisfying. The whole crux of the game, namely the violence done between man and xenomorph, is an unconscionable mess. Granted, combat in <em>Aliens</em> mostly boiled down to big, tough marines being savaged by creatures their weaponry and hubris could not stand up to, and that would probably not make for much of a game if repeated over long level sections in a shooter. So instead, xenos come frolicking after you, bounding up one leap at a time until they're right up in your face, swiping and snarling until you pump enough bullets into them to make them dissolve into acidic goo.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2430647\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2430647\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Multiplayer seems well-meaning, but isn't nearly balanced nor interesting enough to keep your attention.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Yes, this does become quite repetitive. The xenomorphs just aren't built to surprise you, or force you to really do anything other than just fire at anything that looks black and menacing. They crawl around on walls, sure, but the way they're scripted to attack robs the game of any tension or excitement. You will hear a blip on your motion tracker (a largely useless device in the context of this game), and suddenly there will be bad guys. Considering this game's only scare tactic is to have aliens start crawling out of air vents or bursting out of floors when you supposedly least expect it--keep in mind, it does this in pretty much every other corridor or room--this solitary ping is a shockingly ill-conceived move, in that it steels you for what's about to come every single time. If you had to actually use the motion tracker (which replaces the gun in your hand) for any kind of early warning, that'd make for some interesting, tense moments as you scan around for movement. But no, all you have to do is wait for the ping, and have your gun ready.</p><p style=\"\">That Colonial Marines' campaign so thoroughly lacks in dread or terror is perhaps the most damning thing I can say about it. The only time the game pulls off anything even resembling unease is during a brief scene when your character is alone and without weapons. Zombie xenomorphs (no, seriously) who cannot see but can sense motion stumble around in Hadley's Hope's sewage, and as you fumble around in the dark, you're unsure which alien husks are still alive, and which are dead. For a moment, this is terrifying, but then the first moving zombie xeno appears, begins glowing an irradiated green, and then runs toward something moving and explodes. Suddenly, the scary gives way to the silly, and any hope you might have had of being properly frightened just flies out the window.</p><p style=\"\">The zombie xenos are dumb-looking, but really all of the game's xenos are dumb-acting. Far from the efficient killing machines of the movies, these xenos are clumsy, dimwitted, and seemingly incapable of handling even just a few broken-down marines. The AI will frequently bug out, so to speak, leaving xenos pathetically trying to crawl up stairs, getting hung up in doorways, or just standing at unremarkable distances, stoically, as you pump dozens of rounds into them. Human enemies aren't much better, though they usually are able to walk around basic obstacles and even use cover.</p><p style=\"\">AI bugs are just one of the many technical issues that plague Colonial Marines. There are serious glitches to be found elsewhere, often in the vein of weird debug code popping into random gameplay sequences and then just disappearing, environments simply not loading properly, or character and xenomorph animations flipping out into spazzy, bizarre flurries of movement. It's ugly stuff made even uglier by the world surrounding it. Sure, the artists involved in this game's development nailed a lot of the little details from the movie, from the ship design of the Sulaco, to the decimated ruins of Hadley's Hope down on the planet. But those things all had reference material, something to copy from, rather than something to be outright created. Where the game is forced to fill in the margins is where it gets downright unpleasant. Character models are bug-eyed, emotionless, and generally poorly animated, while environments often look crusty and poorly lit. No, I don't mean in that \"we're keeping it dark to maintain a sense of dread\" kind of way. I mean in that \"we're trying to keep your eyes off these years-old looking environmental textures\" kind of way.</p><p style=\"\">Some will undoubtedly complain that the single-player campaign, which can also be played cooperatively (more on that in a moment), doesn't take longer than maybe five hours to finish. However, I don't consider that to be one of the game's faults. In absence of a strong story, Colonial Marines already drags as it plods along, tossing xenomorph after xenomorph at you, struggling mightily to get you to all the different landmarks it figures you're itching to see while also maintaining some semblance of an atmosphere. As it is, the campaign is merely severely disappointing and often unpleasant. Were it any longer, it'd be be outright unbearable.</p><p style=\"\">As for the co-op, it has all the hallmarks of a feature hastily tossed in late in a development cycle. Up to four players can experience this idiotic story together, but only one character is really acknowledged or even focused on for the duration. You don't take over the roles of AI teammates already embedded in the story, but rather other marines who simply do not exist otherwise. Worse, many levels were clearly not designed for multiple people. Corridors are cramped to the point of bursting, which makes particularly heated firefights against the xenos utterly incomprehensible. And that level I mentioned earlier, the one where you have no guns? Right, that still happens, but with multiple people, which is hilarious since characters will often warp to one another if they become too far separated.

Don't play this game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Elsewhere, there is competitive multiplayer featuring teams of marines and xenomorphs. The playable xenomorphs are an interesting idea (that has, admittedly, been done better elsewhere), in that they can climb walls, have different attack classes (spitters can do ranged attacks, while lurkers can move more stealthily), and require a different sort of teamwork than playing as a marine. Unfortunately, too many of the game's multiplayer modes favor the marines, who are far better armed and better equipped to handle the xenos than the reverse. Xenos are remarkably easy to kill, which means the xenos are forced to stay stealthy. Doing so is easier said than done, and the lack of attack variety in the playable xenos eventually leads you to wonder if it's even worth the trouble. Nailing a marine the first few times is actually quite satisfying, but as matches wear on, it becomes far less so.</p><p style=\"\">It's strange and depressing thing to consider a game like Aliens: Colonial Marines. Think of all the potential, the time, the effort, the budget used up over these last several years, only to produce something so deeply, fundamentally flawed in every facet of its execution. Instead of the properly reverent <em>Aliens</em> sequel Gearbox supposedly set out to make, they've shoved this awful, grotesque thing into the chest cavity of the very franchise that they purported to love.

The resulting mix is a game that tempers some of KojiPro's penchant for long-winded cutscenes by flooding it full of enemy cyborgs that are just begging for you to cut them into hundreds of tiny bits while also reigning in some of Platinum's wilder narrative tendencies. In short, it's a quick cut through the world of Metal Gear that mentions just enough about the <a href=\"/the-patriots/3015-2032/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2032\">Patriots</a> and the War Economy to let you feel like you're keeping up on the state of post-<a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/3030-20669/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\">MGS4</a> Metal Gear while also filling it full of ridiculous, entertaining combat sequences and, for whatever reason, a whole lot of cursing.</p><p style=\"\">Set four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4, Rising is all about Raiden, who had been turned into a cyborg ninja the last time we saw him. These days, Raiden and his robot body are working for Maverick, one of several <a href=\"/private-military-company/3015-3535/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3535\">private military companies</a> that rent out their services to the highest bidder. At the opening of the game, Maverick is overseeing security for an African prime minister that is on the verge of bringing peace to the region. A rival PMC intervenes, Raiden is outmatched, and a personal revenge tale is set into motion. Over seven chapters you'll chase down said rival PMC, deal with Raiden's past as a child soldier, and get yourself caught up in the sort of world-ending, conspiratorial gaga that can only come from a game with Metal Gear written on its box. It's a fun story that practically opens with Raiden dismantling a <a href=\"/metal-gear/3055-28/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-28\">Metal Gear</a> with his sword, and it just keeps escalating from there, culminating in a final, over-the-top confrontation that manages to meld the sensibilities of both of its development studios almost perfectly.</p><p style=\"\">The combat in Rising isn't the most complex combat that Platinum has produced, but it strikes a rewarding balance between mashing on the attack buttons like a crazy person and using proper skill to to take out your foes more selectively. As you set the difficulty higher and higher, it gets harder and harder to mash your way out of trouble. The fighting starts with a standard two-button, light/heavy system that expands as you unlock additional moves. This gives you access to launchers, leg sweeps, and the ability to parry attacks while you're in the air. Defense is a pretty active system in Rising. Instead of giving you a block button, the only way to deal with incoming attacks is to either get out of the way or parry them with your light attack button and a push in that enemy's direction.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10798/2336539-mgr_120920_mistral_attack_whip_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336539\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10798/2336539-mgr_120920_mistral_attack_whip_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2336539\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10798/2336539-mgr_120920_mistral_attack_whip_0.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Well-timed parries set enemies up for quick kills via \"blade mode,\" a sort of <a href=\"/slow-motion/3015-1323/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1323\">slow-motion</a> effect that allows you to flick the right analog stick around to cut wildly, slicing dying enemies into hundreds of pieces along the way. Done after a parry or to a weakened enemy, blade mode sets up \"zandatsu\" kills, which draws a box over a target area on an enemy. Slicing that area gives you access to an enemy's innards, and if you grab said innards before they hit the ground, it'll refill your health and battery reserves. It's... pretty cool. Gruesome, you say? Well, what if I told you that every enemy in the game is a <a href=\"/cyborg/3015-950/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-950\">cyborg</a> and that you're technically just cutting apart a lot of robotic limbs and torsos? No? That doesn't make you feel any better? Hmm. Well... it's still pretty cool, even if the process itself gets repetitive over the course of the game. Off of a perfect counter, zandatsu kills are the same basic per-enemy animation every time, so the better you are at playing defense, the more often you'll see the same things over and over again.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">As you play, you'll unlock the ability to equip additional weapons, which replace your heavy attack with a <a href=\"/bo/3055-1761/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1761\">pole</a>, magnetic <a href=\"/sai/3055-206/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-206\">sai</a>, and others. This gives you a bit of extra flexibility. The game also has disposable sub-weapons, like <a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launchers</a> and grenades, but those seem like they're for chumps. You're a ninja-cyborg-guy with an electric sword designed to slice anything and everything into bits. Rockets and grenades just feel cheap and useless by comparison.</p><p style=\"\">Rising looks nice on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, with a solid frame rate during gameplay that occasionally dips when codec sequences load up. The game's flashiest graphical feature is your ability to slice apart a lot of the objects in the environment, from fences that block your path to police cars that are just there for you to cut into tiny pieces. The slicing looks a little corny, especially when you're cutting humanoid enemies up into 200 pieces (the game helpfully keeps track of how many pieces you're creating), but it all comes together to benefit the game's over-the-top sensibilities. There's a batch of nice voice work throughout Rising, but I found <a href=\"/raiden/3005-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-347\">Raiden</a>, the main character himself, to sound worse as the game went on. As he runs himself more and more ragged over the course of the campaign, he starts to sound more and more gravelly, but it doesn't sound \"tough.\" It sounds silly.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2228791-mgre3201210.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2228791\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2228791-mgre3201210.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2228791\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2228791-mgre3201210.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2228791-mgre3201210.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>This guy? Not your friend.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Metal Gear Rising is a short game. My first time through on normal took an afternoon, and that includes watching all of the cutscenes and dying three or four times along the way. The game keeps a clock that tracks your best times through each area and removes cutscene time. So, if you subtract the time I spent seeing the story and replaying parts where I died, it took me a little over four hours of gameplay to get to the end. If you're the type of person who thrives on getting S-ranks in every single combat chapter and wants to play through on all four difficulty settings and unlock every VR mission, you'll find plenty to do. But if you're just here to see the story, it's a little thin. I didn't find it to be criminally short, though, and artificially lengthening the game would make the issue of seeing the same zandatsu kills over and over again far worse. It's about as long as it needs to be to wring everything out of its mechanics. It's enjoyable, with a story that goes in some really wild directions, but don't come to Rising expecting a game that rivals typical Metal Gear Solid games in length. Even if you go out of your way to listen to as many optional codec conversations as you can (you can call a few key members of your support team at any time for a check-in), it might not hold your attention for very long.</p><p style=\"\">Even with that in mind, I found Metal Gear Rising to be a thrilling and engaging experience. The swordplay is fun, and it's really fascinating to see the different spots where either Kojima's or Platinum's signature styles shine through. It also has a wild final confrontation that shows elements of both, doling out some heavy-handed political preaching while also putting a man-sized ninja cyborg up against... well, something way crazier (and dirty-mouthed) than a man-sized ninja cyborg. If you're a value-minded individual that doesn't tend to replay games, Metal Gear Rising will only make you angry. But if seeing the state of the post-MGS4 world while slicing your way through everything that gets in your way sounds like a good time, well, that's because it is.</p>", "deck": "The points where the styles of Kojima Productions and PlatinumGames collide make playing Metal Gear Rising a short but enjoyable trip through a post-MGS4 world.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-560/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26801/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance/3030-26801/", "id": 26801, "name": "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-02-19 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84188/", "id": 84188, "name": "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tomb-raider-review/1900-561/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2381365-tr12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381365\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2381365-tr12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381365\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2381365-tr12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Not pictured: shooting hundreds of dudes in the face.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If the goal of the \"reboot\" is to free a creaky old franchise of its baggage, strip its protagonist of their larger-than-life attributes, and get back to basics, then consider the new <a href=\"/tomb-raider/3030-27312/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27312\">Tomb Raider</a> a successful reboot. The game relieves <a href=\"/lara-croft/3005-195/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-195\">Lara Croft</a> of her backflipping, wisecracking ways, recasting her as a wide-eyed young archeologist of no particular good breeding, out on a commissioned ship to make her mark on the world by finding--and shooting a reality TV series around--the lost island kingdom of Yamatai. The harrowing survival tale that commences once she arrives on the island molds Lara into a shockingly capable killer a little faster than I would have liked, but ultimately this origin story serves as a sturdier and more respectable springboard for further Lara Croft adventures than any previous game in the series.</p><p style=\"\">Lara makes her way to the island with a band of researchers and television types in tow, and after the shipwreck scatters them all around the island, the game does a fair job, with voiceovers and flashbacks, of having you cross paths with each crew member and filling in the ways each one relates to Lara and how they may have helped or hindered her journey. The game is less successful at believably depicting Lara's own transition from eager young scientist to cold-blooded survivalist killing machine. The hasty remorse she offers when first hunting a deer for food or making her first human kill, in defense against the crazed cultists who rule the island, is hard to take seriously when you're then encouraged to slaughter every living thing in sight, human and animal alike, with a stock-standard video game arsenal of assault rifle, shotgun, grenade launcher, and flame-tipped arrows.</p><p style=\"\">In its efforts to paint Lara as a vulnerable but resilient heroine, the game suffers an identity crisis of sorts. It swings wildly between quiet character moments, where you feel every bit of the physical pain and emotional anguish her grueling situation entails, and the sort of ludicrous, over-the-top action this medium just can't get enough of. The contrast is only so irksome because the game goes to such great lengths to legitimize Lara's struggle in the first place, but regardless, it sometimes feels like a constant process of two steps forward, one step back. Here's one egregious example. In an early cutscene, Lara visibly shivers by a campfire at night in a forest somewhere around sea level. Two hours later, you're high up in the mountains in near-blizzard conditions, making absurd death-defying leaps between radio towers wearing nothing but a tank top (and by this time you've clearly gotten over that earlier compunction about taking a human life, since you're now taking scores of them as a matter of course). To the story's credit, once Lara becomes visibly fed up with everything the bad guys are putting her through, and starts flinging back harsh words as readily as bullets, it became a lot easier to buy into her character arc, and the game ultimately does leave Lara a changed person who could believably kick off a whole new franchise. But in the first half, that strained dichotomy between beset young girl and invincible killer made me wish the developers had picked one style of characterization or the other and really focused on it.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2381360-tr7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381360\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2381360-tr7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381360\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/4/49445/2381360-tr7.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Storytelling quibbles aside, Tomb Raider plays quite well by modern action standards. The game offers an unusual structure that straddles the line between a couple of distinctive genres, though it took me some time to come to grips with what the game actually is. That's because the big island map--split into little subsections with names like \"Coastal Forest\" and \"Base Approach,\" each with an exhaustive lists of challenges and collectibles--gives one the impression of an open-world game with a fair amount of freedom to dally and explore. (Some of the game's marketing has not exactly dispelled this notion.) In actuality, Tomb Raider is a mostly linear game whose story propels you through those discrete regions one after the other, often with some sort of larger-than-life action sequence bridging the transition. Many of the game's combat sequences are also rigidly linear, though a few (which not coincidentally were my favorite) take place in wider areas and let you sneak around and get more creative with the ways you approach them. At least you're free to fast travel back to previous areas to check off all those collectibles and earn extra upgrade points after the fact, though.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">In addition to revisiting previously explored regions at will to look for shiny baubles, you'll also come back to some of the larger levels for a second or occasionally even third time at the behest of the story. Thankfully, the mandatory backtracking avoids feeling like a cheap rehash and instead helps create a cohesive sense of place, since the designers usually have you reenter these areas from a different, previously inaccessible point, and then go on to send you along a different route than you took the first time. There are also new things for you to look for when you backtrack, since the game doles out new gear and abilities consistently over the course of the story, like a rope-arrow you can fire to make a bridge across chasms, that lets you get into new parts of the levels you couldn't get to previously. This system isn't as integral to the flow of the game as in your average <a href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\">Metroidvania</a>--you're often only gaining access to more collectibles or some very brief \"optional tombs\" to raid--but it's still satisfying to wring a bit more out of the game world as you move back and forth.</p><p style=\"\">Parts of Tomb Raider--potentially too many parts, depending on your taste--come off as the developers doing their best <a href=\"/uncharted/3025-957/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-957\">Uncharted</a> impression, as you <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Event</a> your way through a large number of barely interactive action sequences that have everything around you exploding in a hail of splinters and fire that magically leaves you without a scratch. Actually, no, Lara comes out with plenty of visible scratches--the game pulls the effective trick of distressing her clothes and appearance more and more as the game goes on, a la <a href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\">Arkham Asylum</a>. But you never once feel like she's in true danger, which can make the whole thing feel a bit like it's just going through the cinematic-action-game motions. I wish less time and effort had been devoted to these bombastic scenes and more put into the old Tomb Raider standby of climbing around on old ruins, giving you the chance to feel a more tactile connection to the mystical past that forms the backbone of this game's storyline. Those combat-free optional tombs are the closest you get to solving any ancient <a href=\"/rube-goldberg-puzzler/3015-1820/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1820\">Rube Goldberg</a> machines, but they're insultingly short--I bet the handful included here constitute no more than half an hour of gameplay, collectively--and largely just made me wish there were a lot more of them included.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2381362-tr9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381362\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2381362-tr9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381362\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2381362-tr9.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2381362-tr9.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The robust upgrade system lets you deeply customize your combat options.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you're going to spend a lot of time fighting, at least the combat and attendant character-progression mechanics are implemented well, giving you a ton of options as to which weapons you want to enhance with better basic stats and a few interesting extra abilities, and which extra combat maneuvers, such as an array of dodge-counters, you want to unlock. There's a long list of extra abilities not related to combat, as well, including an enhancement to your show-me-everything-I-can-interact-with vision mode that reveals those scores of collectibles through walls, and annotates them on your map in a really smart way. If you're the type of person who enjoys going back and collecting every last thing, you'll get a whole lot of mileage out of Tomb Raider. But even if you're a one-and-done sort of player, the game is still quite long and doesn't exactly skimp on content in the first place.</p><p style=\"\">There's also a reasonably full-featured multiplayer mode, but I didn't get much out of it since it's so similar to other third-person multiplayer modes, most notably the one in the Uncharted games. There's a fully realized leveling and loadout system that gives you tons of options for customizing the way you play, but this long after <a href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-25636/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25636\">Call of Duty 4</a> it's just hard to get excited about that sort of thing anymore. The most interesting part of the multiplayer is the handful of traps, like rope snares and lightning rods, you can set to trip up other players when they unwittingly run over them, but that's small comfort when you've seen most of this stuff before. The multiplayer in the 360 version also suffered from an absolutely abysmal frame rate when firing while zoomed in, but that's such a specific problem I'd like to believe it will promptly be addressed with a patch. In single-player, the 360 game is quite a looker, though it does tend to chop up a bit here and there.

It took a lot of the cool enemy tagging and freeform tactical combat from <a href=\"/crytek-gmbh/3010-268/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-268\">Crytek</a>'s previous games and presented it in a more coherent way. It was an intelligently streamlined experience that, as a person that couldn't get into the first game's wide-open antics, split the difference between the first game and the more guided, rollercoaster-style take on shooter campaign design that was, at one point anyway, all the rage. <a href=\"/crysis-3/3030-37957/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37957\">Crysis 3</a>, on the other hand, feels like a developer attempting to push its luck a little too far. It picks up where the previous game left off and doesn't make dramatic changes. For the most part, it's well-made, and on the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> it's still quite a graphical showpiece, but that doesn't make up for the prosaic nature of the rest of Crysis 3.</p><p style=\"\">Crysis 3 reunites <a href=\"/prophet/3005-1882/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1882\">Prophet</a>, the nanosuit-wearing super soldier of record, with <a href=\"/psycho/3005-1888/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1888\">Psycho</a>, the playable character in the old side-story, <a href=\"/crysis-warhead/3030-21230/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21230\">Crysis Warhead</a>. In the years since that game, Psycho has been painfully yanked out of his nanosuit, and Prophet--whatever the heck <i>he</i> is at this point--has just been broken loose by Psycho and a ragtag group of rebels who are up against CELL, which is your typically evil corporation-slash-private-military-slash-toying-with-power-it-doesn't-understand. While the rebels are obsessed with CELL, Prophet's worried about the greater threat of the Ceph, the alien race he crippled in Crysis 2. With Prophet being, well, a <i>prophet</i>, it shouldn't surprise you that you'll spend more time in Crysis 3 fighting off the alien menace. The story hinges on your ability to care about Psycho and Prophet as characters, something that the previous games haven't exactly made a priority. As a result, the reasoning behind the action is straight-up bland, skirting dangerously close to the same \"only One Man can save us from this Ancient Alien Threat\" story that seems to drive so many different sci-fi trilogies these days.</p><p style=\"\">The action end of Crysis 3 is totally competent, with the same suit powers you saw in the previous game. The cloak lets you move slowly and quietly to get behind enemies for stealth kills, while the armor mode lets you get out of a jam when you get caught. This time around, Prophet can wield a bow, giving you another way to kill enemies while staying fully cloaked. If you're the patient type, the bow is overpowered, letting you trivialize many of the game's encounters as long as you're willing to back off and let your cloak energy recharge. If you're the gung-ho type, it's useless. The game also has collectable upgrade points that unlock perks across four different categories. The game takes the <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a> comparison a step further by offering upgraded versions of those perks that unlock when you complete in-game challenges. So you may have to get 25 stealth kills to make your cloak last even longer than it would normally, or perhaps your ability to tag enemies extends even further when you tag 25 enemies with your spotting scope with the basic version of the upgrade equipped. There are a lot of different options to unlock and use, but I found that the vast majority of them didn't fit at all with my style, so I had already selected and upgraded the optimal perks well before the game was over.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2368955-crysis_3___mta_train_yard_fields.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2368955\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2368955-crysis_3___mta_train_yard_fields.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2368955\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/135472/2368955-crysis_3___mta_train_yard_fields.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Though the game opens up into large areas near its conclusion, much of the game is paced in a way that helps make combat feel more monotonous. You'll encounter an enemy here and there, but for the most part you stumble upon groups of nine or so foes who aren't aware of your presence yet. This gives you time to tag all the enemies and figure out how to take them on. Typically, the bow is a fine solution, since it kills most basic enemies in one hit and doesn't break stealth. If another enemy sees a body go down, a couple of reinforcements come in and the remaining enemies are alerted, making them skitter around a bit more frantically. This just makes them slightly harder--though certainly not impossible--to hit with the bow. Eventually you'll run out of arrows or just get bored of picking them off this way and switch to guns to just get on with it. Even the larger alien enemies you face later on don't feel particularly deadly on what the game makes out to be its equivalent of \"medium\" difficulty, but I also never felt like i had enough exciting options at hand to make these encounters fun in the sandboxy way that these games have been in the past. At some point I just found myself stealthing past entire waves of enemies, when possible.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Why, then, is Crysis 3 not a bad game? Well, if we're talking about the PC version on a reasonably powerful machine, we're talking about the franchise's standout feature. It's a great-looking game. The opening, where Psycho rescues Prophet in the middle of a rain storm, is a striking moment, with everything from the rain to Psycho's scarred-up face worth taking a closer look at. Eventually, the visual quality starts to fade into the background as you go from one military-looking installation to the next, but the spots where you get outside and see the game's take on a completely overgrown, almost jungle-like New York City can be absolutely stunning. I stopped dead in my tracks on a few occasions just to look around and take it all in. The <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> version is grungy, by comparison, with lower texture quality and a lower framerate. That's unsurprising, but when taken against the other games on the platform, the 360 version still looks OK. It's certainly playable, anyway, though a weird audio bug made one of the early open-area segments practically unplayable, since it's hard to know when to take cover and hide from incoming rockets if the audio isn't playing back at all. For what it's worth, the Crysis 3 Twitter account claims that a patch is in the works, but said patch isn't available as of this writing, so if you've got a home theater set up, keep an ear out for that.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2410210-7wep3shot902892.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2410210\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2410210-7wep3shot902892.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2410210\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2410210-7wep3shot902892.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2410210-7wep3shot902892.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Guns!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Crysis 3 also contains competitive multiplayer with the same sort of loadout-based progression and killstreak bonuses. It's a formula for a reason, but it's not getting any fresher, that's for sure. I really liked seeing an updated version of the Skyline map, which was my favorite spot to play in Crysis 2. At the same time, if the coolest part of the multiplayer is that it has my favorite map from the previous game, well, that's probably not a great thing, right? The multiplayer is absolutely functional and ships with a handful of game types, including a modifier that takes players out of the suits, eliminating the power angle completely, in case you weren't interested in using the one thing that makes Crysis stand apart from the competition. It's not bad, but you could do better with another game.</p><p style=\"\">That's my feeling about all of Crysis 3, really. It's serviceable and, again, it looks great on the PC, but was this trip really necessary? It's an average experience, overall, and in a genre that continues to be packed full of competition, you'd probably be better off finding a discounted copy of Crysis 2 or, if the large combat areas of the original Crysis really float your boat, spend some time with Far Cry 3, instead.</p>", "deck": "Crysis 3 looks great on the PC, but was this sequel really necessary?", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-562/", "platforms": "PC, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-37957/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/crysis-3/3030-37957/", "id": 37957, "name": "Crysis 3"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-02-28 18:55:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-116244/", "id": 116244, "name": "Crysis 3"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/simcity-review/1900-563/", "description": "<p style=\"\">To talk of this game is to tell a tale of two SimCities. On one side of the border is a brilliant, vibrantly realized reboot of <a href=\"/maxis-software/3010-205/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-205\">Maxis</a>' classic <a href=\"/simcity/3030-37620/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37620\">SimCity</a> franchise. After a 10-year break, here is a game that presents the modern city builder with nearly every possible tool one could hope for to build the bustling metropolis of their dreams. It is gorgeous to look at when properly taken advantage of with the latest <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> hardware, artfully designed for minimal user interface turmoil, and just exquisitely charming across the board. Across the border, however, is another SimCity entirely. This one is a stricter game than the one franchise fans have come to know over the years, one more dedicated to a single-minded way of cooperative thinking. In this SimCity, a single city cannot survive without another nearby to pick up the slack. Multiplayer is heavily encouraged, to the point of insistence, and yet the safeguards that aim to prevent problematic behavior on the part of others are minimal, and frankly unreliable. Which is to say nothing of its overall, online-always infrastructure, one which has, at times already, hamstrung the entirety of this new SimCity's lush, yet disappointingly underutilized region.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2422011-2013_01_26.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2422011\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39388/2422011-2013_01_26.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2422011\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39388/2422011-2013_01_26.png\"></a><figcaption>You start off with a nice patch of land, but you'll be surprised how quickly that space fills.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Understand, SimCity is extremely capable of being the grand reboot of the series it aims to be, at least in spurts. The core act of city-building, which has been using most of the same basic ideas since its inception nearly 25 years ago, has rarely been more elegantly realized. The tools to build with are numerous and overwhelming. Of course you will start out your new city by laying down zones for residential, commercial, and industrial, perhaps by building a couple of city services, plopping down (to use the game's parlance) a power plant, and then a water tower, and then a garbage dump, and it just goes on. Every building option you have comes with option upon option underneath. Do you spend the money now on a single police station, or do you save up for the bigger, more all-encompassing precinct? Do you want a simple BBQ pit park, or a giant fountain sculpture to really boost land value? Is your hospital running out of room for sick patients? Why not just build another row of patient rooms on what you've already got?</p><p style=\"\">Half the fun of SimCity is just trying to figure out the best, most efficient ways to build <i>everything</i>. And this SimCity often scratches that itch wonderfully. It even offers tremendous flexibility in the design of your city, both from a geographical standpoint, and in terms of economy. To the former, roads can now be curved, built in circles, perfect blocks, really whatever you like. Roads are upgradable too, so a small avenue can become a large commercial one later on.</p><p style=\"\">More interesting are the city specialties, special economic focuses that allow you to build, say, an oil pump or two if your land is rich in fossil fuels. Or perhaps tourism, if your interest pertains to building famous landmarks (some of which can be bought via the game's DLC store). Or, if you just like making money, there's always the gambling route. These specialties provide an extra layer of challenge, in that you kind of have to build your city around them, as opposed to just deciding on them later. Otherwise you'll spend a lot of time bulldozing and rezoning things as you try to figure out how to squeeze an ore mine into a residential neighborhood.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Maybe I'm alone on this one, but one of my favorite things about the old SimCity games were the stupid charts you could look at to see where crime was prolific, how property values varied across my city, who was happy or displeased with my mayoral performance, and such. Even if you don't understand me, this SimCity does. There are graphs upon charts upon data screens to play with, all giving ample information on every aspect of how my city is running. It's beautiful stuff, though it's also occasionally bogged down by sloppy data reporting. Often times fixing problems within my city, like sewage outflow issues or power outages, would result in continued displeasure from my citizens for quite some time. This can sometimes make it difficult to judge whether you've actually solved the issue or not.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/578/2224367-sim_city_industrial.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2224367\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/578/2224367-sim_city_industrial.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2224367\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/578/2224367-sim_city_industrial.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Coordinating city specializations is key, lest you end up with a region full of industrial polluters.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Far more problematic than any of that, however, is really the other half of SimCity. It is the multiplayer, the skeletal structure in which the city building meat of the game has been somewhat awkwardly stuffed into. At the outset of every game, you are asked to pick a region. Right from the get-go, you can choose to join an already existing region, which has been started by another online player, or create your own. Once in a region, you can choose to be the mayor of as many of the city plots as you please, but there are always multiple plots, and to leave a whole region unused puts a burden on your city that the game isn't designed to alleviate through single-player play.</p><p style=\"\">Essentially, SimCity doesn't really want you to have one city that has all available services and resources. As with the city specialties, there is significant financial and strategic benefit to having one city that's, say, more apt to house polluting industrial factories, or garbage dumps. Such a city might not have a huge residential population, nor much potential for high land value items, but it can make money by housing jobs that citizens in other cities can commute to, and even by housing other cities' garbage.</p><p style=\"\">This cooperation becomes crucial, as there really isn't enough money, nor space to allow one city to bear all the major burdens at once. That last point is a particularly stinging one. Regions are broken up into squared-off city areas within a larger area of land. In between the cities are vast zones of dead space that essentially just exist to make the region look more natural. While it certainly can take a while to fill up an entire plot of land--especially in areas rife with mountains or plateaus--you will eventually fill it up. The game goes out of its way to try and help you build using the most efficient layouts possible, even offering a road guide that shows you ideal places for streets and avenues. But even following the guides stringently, you'll eventually run out of room, leaving you to try and squeeze whatever zoning density you possibly can out of every little corner you own. There is probably a very good technical reason for why you can't use any of that extra land, but it is nonetheless a terrible tease.</p><p style=\"\">Yes, it is entirely possible to play SimCity on your own, without any other players, but this is not really ideal. If you're managing multiple cities in a region, that turns an already intense time suck into a more stressful endeavor. I did not enjoy the act of trying to balance multiple cities in a region by myself. Don't get me wrong, I'm generally of the mindset that games like SimCity should be played in tomb-like isolation, but that isn't how <em>this</em> SimCity is meant to be played. It's meant to be played with friends. To try and fight against its multiplayer is to fight against the very nature of this game's design.</p><p style=\"\">The thing of it is, if you can get a group of enthusiastic players together, the kind you know won't do dickish things, like polluting your region to death, or harboring scads of murderers in their dilapidated hellhole of a town, SimCity <i>works</i>. As weird and awkward as it seems at first, the more you play it under ideal conditions, the more clear Maxis' vision for this game becomes. It's almost like a kind of social experiment in cooperation, albeit one that is perhaps a bit too open to exploitation. While you can't just go in and wreck anyone's city wholesale, there are smaller, more insidious things players can do to royally screw up someone's region, and don't think there won't be those people. Of course, you can always set your game to private, making sure that only friends and likeminded individuals can join. But if my experience has been any indication, those safeguards aren't terribly reliable right now. I had one early region set to private, and then after a bit of server wonkiness, it had become infested with unfamiliars.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/578/2224368-sim_city_fire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2224368\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/578/2224368-sim_city_fire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2224368\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/578/2224368-sim_city_fire.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/578/2224368-sim_city_fire.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Insert metaphor for EA's online servers here.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Granted, that is an issue that may have just been the result of launch jitters on EA's servers, but this brings us to the biggest flaw in SimCity's design. SimCity is an always-online game, meaning if the servers are off, everybody's game is off. EA calls SimCity's multiplayer asynchronous, and that's partially correct. There's nothing that requires players to be on at the same time to play. However, we do all have to be able to connect to EA's servers to play. Yes, even if you just want to noodle around in your own city and don't care an iota what's going on in the larger region today, you can't load up your city data if the servers are down. And the servers have been down. Several times, in fact, since the game launched this past Tuesday. A week from now, these concerns might not even be justified. The servers could be back up and work flawlessly forever a minute after this is published. Regardless, this underlying philosophy, one that dictates that if everyone can't play, then no one shall play, is a troubling one.</p><p style=\"\">It is therefore difficult to completely reconcile a game like SimCity. This is a game with startling clarity of vision, but that vision often feels narrow and intractable. It knows precisely what it wants to be, and in most key ways, executes on those ideas with precision. But in setting that course, it all but dismisses the way in which many played SimCity sequel after sequel. And while I expect many will fall head-over-heels in love with this SimCity's cooperative design, at its best, the game feels more like a really thoughtfully designed multiplayer mode for a larger, single-player capable game that, sadly, doesn't exist.

At the risk of sounding overly reductive, if you spent any time at all with Wings of Liberty, you already know exactly how excited you should be to play Heart of the Swarm, or even whether you should play it at all.</p><p style=\"\">StarCraft II might as well be two separate products in one box: the story-driven single-player RTS campaign, which is self-explanatory enough that anyone can play it, and a multiplayer mode so wildly fast-paced and complex that it's arguably the hardest video game, if not one of the hardest competitive activities period, to excel at on the planet. Luckily for everyone who wants to avoid falling down the multiplayer rabbit hole, <a href=\"/blizzard-entertainment/3010-1088/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1088\">Blizzard</a> made the wise decision with Wings of Liberty to largely differentiate the content of the campaign from the multiplayer mode. That philosophy continues on here, giving you a new set of story missions centered around <a href=\"/sarah-kerrigan/3005-97/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-97\">Kerrigan</a> and the <a href=\"/zerg/3015-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-361\">Zerg</a> that's just as varied in design as the <a href=\"/terran/3015-976/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-976\">Terran</a> campaign in the previous game.</p><p style=\"\">At two-thirds the price of Wings of Liberty, it shouldn't be surprising that you get about two-thirds as many missions here, but each one features distinctive enough mechanics, objectives, and new units that your progression through the story is thoroughly satisfying. Just like in the last game, there's never an objective as simple as \"build a big base and then go blow up the other guy's base\" (and there are expanded options for skirmishes with AI if that's what you want). Each level places some interesting twist or restriction on map control, time limit, the way you acquire units, and so on, in the same style as the last game. If you've been playing multiplayer since that game came out, you'll find the campaign disappointingly easy on anything but the highest difficulty. But with that mission-to-mission variation and a nicely designed, multi-tiered upgrade system that might be more satisfying than in the previous game, this campaign here is just as much fun as the last one.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2456017-swarm-screenshot26-full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2456017\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2456017-swarm-screenshot26-full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2456017\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2456017-swarm-screenshot26-full.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Would you believe this guy is one of the more likable characters in the campaign?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"> <div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">For better or worse, Heart of the Swarm's storytelling picks up and runs with the same tone and elements established in Wings of Liberty, which is to say there's way more focus on prophecies, artifacts, ancient aliens, and the somewhat out-of-left-field romantic cheese between Kerrigan and <a href=\"/jim-raynor/3005-230/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-230\">Jimmy Raynor</a>, and less on the backstabbing, intrigue, and factional maneuvering of the old StarCraft games. The plot is moderately successful at creating a redemptive arc of sorts for Kerrigan, which is good since you're playing as her in this add-on, though some of the dialogue between Kerrigan and Raynor is laugh-out-loud goofy. Some other aspects of the campaign story are a bit ridiculous and hackneyed as well, and if you've played many Blizzard games it's easy to predict exactly where this whole trilogy is probably going to end up. But there are also a handful of neat, nostalgic callbacks to the story of <a href=\"/starcraft-brood-war/3030-5415/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5415\">Brood War</a>, and I found quite a few of the supporting characters to be pretty likable. There's also what feels like more of Blizzard's best-in-class CG cinematics than there were in Wings of Liberty. There are worse video game stories out there, and it's a lot easier to forgive since the single-player game is so much fun, but at this point the overall plot arc of StarCraft II is a bit easier to enjoy if you don't take it <em>too</em> seriously.</p><p style=\"\">At any rate, StarCraft is on the very short list of games whose multiplayer modes have far surpassed their story campaigns in popularity, so if the updates on the multiplayer side weren't up to snuff, this whole expansion would be pointless. While it will take months for the true usefulness of the new units and changes to become clear, my initial impression is that the all the new stuff is going to provide a serious kick in the pants to the metagame, which had gotten stale enough to make me pay little or no attention to the game at all for several months. Most imporantly to me, the Protoss finally have a valid tech path through the Stargate, between the new support/harass flier the Oracle and the long-range Tempest, that frees them up from needing to go straight to a Robotics Facility every single match. And the defensive Mothership Core lets you expand early on without quite as much fear of a rush shutting you down before you get started.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2456018-6234184001-zerg_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2456018\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2456018-6234184001-zerg_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2456018\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2456018-6234184001-zerg_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2456018-6234184001-zerg_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The expansion's new and modified units seem like they'll really revitalize the evolving competition in multiplayer.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But wait, there's more! A lot more. The Terrans get some important close-quarters capability (and a nod to the old Firebat) with the Hellbat transformation mode for the Hellion, and the new hidden Widow Mine provides some really annoying defense and containment options, since the mine doesn't actually destroy itself upon firing but has to be taken out manually. (It helps to know about this before you go up against a mined ramp). The Zerg's new flying caster the Viper and burrowed siege unit the Swarm Host should give the creepy-crawliest faction some extra options in engagements and increased map control, respectively. I'm just starting to get my head around all this stuff in competitive play, but I can confidently say the new dynamics these guys are bringing about are already enough to get me interested in playing multiplayer again.</p><p style=\"\">Ever since I randomly lucked into the beta for <a href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\">Warcraft III</a> before my time in the games press, I've deeply admired Blizzard's take-no-prisoners approach to RTS balance, and Heart of the Swarm shows they still aren't afraid to make cuts and deep changes wherever appropriate. In that sense, the modifications to existing units may be even more important to the longterm health of StarCraft II than the new units. The overly powerful Terran Warhound from early in the beta is gone, while the Carrier, long subject to removal, somehow managed to survive through to the shipping game. Void Rays don't charge up anymore, but have an active ability with bonus damage to armor instead. The underused Hydralisk, a mainstay of the Zerg army in Brood War, finally has its speed upgrade back. The infernal Medivac also gets a speed boost with an awfully short cooldown. A speed boost? Like Terrans needed any help dropping your expansions? While each faction only gets two or three all-new units, there are so many changes across the board in this expansion that it practically feels like playing an entirely new game. And that's very exciting.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21836/2419668-xp_score_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2419668\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21836/2419668-xp_score_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2419668\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21836/2419668-xp_score_screen.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21836/2419668-xp_score_screen.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Even the interface around the multiplayer kind of feels like a new game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Blizzard has done quite a bit of work to the StarCraft II client interface, bringing all the content in Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm together into a common interface that will clearly also house <a href=\"/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void/3030-24079/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24079\">Legacy of the Void</a> when it ships a decade from now. The single most important change, which will be new to you if you're just coming back to the game, is an unranked matchmaking option that lets you play against opponents of similar skill without any impact to your all-important ladder standing. This is a much-needed way to get back into the rhythm of competition or play off-race without any sort of ranking anxiety. There's also a new experience system, not dissimilar to that in most shooters these days, that lets you level your way up to new profile portraits and decals. You earn a little experience even when you lose, which ensures everyone will be able to unlock at least a few things. Some of these improvements are also retroactive to Wings of Liberty and thus aren't exclusively part of this expansion package, but they still make the whole experience more enjoyable. If you haven't played StarCraft II since the original came out, every last thing about it today feels different in some minor or major way.</p><p style=\"\">The traditional expansion pack is such a rarity these days that in reviewing one, it's tempting to suspend our standard graded rating system in favor of a binary \"buy it or don't\" recommendation. If the occasionally cheesy storytelling or slavish adherence to resource-gathering and micromanagement put you off of Wings of Liberty, there's nothing in Heart of the Swarm that will bring you back in.

Rather than taking the obvious route and showing you why Fenix needed to be broken out of jail to open the first game, the focus is put on the side characters, <a href=\"/damon-baird/3005-694/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-694\">Baird</a> and <a href=\"/augustus-cole/3005-687/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-687\">Cole</a>. Don't take that to mean that <a href=\"/gears-of-war-judgment/3030-38481/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38481\">Gears of War: Judgment</a> has a deep, engaging story that makes you look upon the whole franchise in a brand-new way or anything, but there's <em>just</em> enough exposition there to keep things moving and <em>just</em> enough of a gameplay tweak to make you wish they had made these changes two games ago. It's a fun but feature-light shooter for people who already enjoy the basic style of Gears of War. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p style=\"\">The bulk of the story is told in flashback, as the four soldiers of Kilo Squad find themselves as defendants in a hastily-assembled trial. Their testimony runs throughout the game--they tell the story, you run from point to point, chainsawing and shooting Locust enemies all the while. There are no surprises along the way, either. Kilo Squad sets out to take down a big bad guy in the area and, by the end of the game, they'll have completed their task. You'll also unlock a second campaign called Aftermath, which is set during the events of Gears of War 3. In Aftermath, you'll take Baird and Cole back into an area from the Judgment campaign as they search for a boat to help with the final assault on Azura. Throughout both campaigns, the characters seem a little subdued when compared to the proper Gears trilogy. There are fewer \"woo!\" moments out of Cole and less machine fixing and complaining out of Baird.</p><p style=\"\">That Aftermath campaign is missing the thing that actually makes Judgment cool in the first place. At the start of every section, you'll find a Gears of War logo glowing on a wall. If you run up to it and hit X, you'll be given the option to \"declassify\" some additional details. These act as modifiers for the gameplay that force you to play Gears of War in different ways. Sometimes you'll have to start a section with very little ammo. Other times you'll be forced to use less-than-ideal weapons for the entire section. Sometimes you'll get time limits, and sometimes you'll encounter dust or gas that makes it hard to see and aim throughout the entire area. It keeps you on your toes and gives you a reason to change up your style and stop chainsawing your way through everything that gets in your way. Each section also has a set of three stars to earn, and enabling the declassified option makes it easier to earn all three of those stars. The tradeoff is that the entire game is broken up into very tight, defined sections, which makes the whole thing feel a little artificial. You're practically given a <a href=\"/left-4-dead/3025-1342/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\">Left 4 Dead</a>-style safe room between every single combat section, packed with guns, ammo, and the declassification icon.

There are a few new weapons, like the Marksa, a semi-automatic rifle with a good scope that makes for a lighter, friendlier gun in medium-range sniping situations. The biggest gameplay change is a control change that makes weapon-switching more like <a href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">Halo</a> or <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a>. Instead of using the D-pad to switch between four different weapons, you can now hold two, and tapping the Y button swaps between them. Grenades are now dedicated to the left bumper, rather than being something you have to select before you can use. This change may come down to personal preference, but playing Gears this way makes me wish it was like this all along. <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">Grenades</a> become a lot more useful when you can just toss one out at will instead of having to stop shooting just to switch over to your grenades.

OverRun pits attacking Locust players against defending humans, like a melding of the co-op-only Beast and <a href=\"/horde-mode/3015-3021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">Horde</a> modes of the past into one competitive mode. It's a fine mode that makes you wonder why it took the developers this long to get here, since all the pieces for this were in place for Gears 3. Survival mode replaces Horde mode, and it's little more than a single-team, co-op-only version of OverRun, with the AI taking up the Locust faction. Both modes are class-based on both sides of the action, so humans can choose a Soldier role, which lets them dispense ammo to teammates, a Medic role that can toss healing grenades, and two others. Locust players use a class-based system similar to Beast mode in Gears 3, with personal points unlocking the ability to spawn as more extreme enemies. OverRun is cool... but Survival isn't as good as Horde mode was in the last game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33870/2433951-gowj-spmansion01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2433951\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.58671875\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33870/2433951-gowj-spmansion01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2433951\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33870/2433951-gowj-spmansion01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33870/2433951-gowj-spmansion01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The members of Kilo Squad.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In addition to those, you can play the campaigns cooperatively or play <a href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">Deathmatch</a>, <a href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\">Team Deathmatch</a>, or Domination games. The game is still packed with ribbons and medals to earn as you play, and as you level up your character you'll earn prize boxes that randomly give you character or weapon skins. Like Gears 3, the game is also packed full of purchasable skins, and these are marked in such a way that makes it look like you'll never be able to unlock a buyable skin via the game's prize boxes. Also on the microtransaction front is the ability to straight-up buy double XP bonuses that last for a set number of matches.

While the two aren't quite canonically related, they feature the same overarching notion of perpetually put-upon survivors fighting to continue their meager existence in a terrible, rotting world. But where Telltale's <a href=\"/the-walking-dead/3030-34205/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34205\">Walking Dead </a>offered up characters, mechanics, and storytelling that all worked in almost entirely harmonious concert, nothing about Survival Instinct feels properly executed, let alone coherent or thoughtful.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2457228-walking_dead_survival_instinct-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2457228\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2457228-walking_dead_survival_instinct-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2457228\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/2457228-walking_dead_survival_instinct-1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The stories of Daryl and Merle are fleshed out a bit in Survival Instinct, but not in a particularly meaningful or entertaining way.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I suppose it's worth noting that the two games are also of entirely different genres. Survival Instinct is a far more action-oriented game than Telltale's traditional adventure, and also is told almost exclusively from the first-person perspective of the show's favorite survivalist, <a href=\"/daryl-dixon/3005-23620/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23620\">Daryl Dixon</a>. The story is something of a prequel to the events of the TV series, showing the early goings of the outbreak that slaughters the majority of the human race, as well as Daryl and his brother Merle's early misadventures in a now post-apocalyptic society. Norman Reedus and <a href=\"/michael-rooker/3040-84143/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-84143\">Michael Rooker</a> appear to voice their respective characters with decent enthusiasm (if not particularly authentic acting), and the developers at <a href=\"/terminal-reality-inc/3010-1531/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1531\">Terminal Reality</a> did do a pretty good job of capturing both actors' likenesses and expressions for the purposes of the game. Unfortunately, those are probably the last nice things I'm going to say about Survival Instinct.</p><p style=\"\">Where to begin? Pretty much from the opening seconds, Survival Instinct makes minimal effort to immerse you in anything resembling an even moderately living world. Environments are bland, linear, and haggard looking in a way that seems less the fault of the apocalypse than the environment and texture artists tasked with trying to make this thing look halfway decent. And that's before you've even killed zombie one. The second those god awful-looking creatures start shambling up to you, the whole thing just falls the hell apart.</p><p style=\"\">Nearly everything else the matter with Survival Instinct can be traced back to the undead hordes shuffling their way around the game's various areas. They're ugly, though again, not in a way that's so much frightening as it is deeply disappointing. Zombie AI is one of those things I'm always somewhat reluctant to criticize, since trying to program the purely instinctual, largely thoughtless behavior of tattered ghouls can't be an exact science. But in Survival Instinct, the science seems to have been abandoned altogether. Zombies are terrible at finding you in the most bizarre of circumstances. Walk past a certain fence or doorway, and they'll just lose complete track of you, or worse yet, still know where you are, but find themselves unable to traverse the corner of the door they've somehow become hooked upon. In open spaces they'll certainly come at you, often in large groups that can't really be fought, in which case your best bet is often just to flee.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2457230-walking_dead_survival_instinct-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2457230\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56346153846154\" data-width=\"520\" style=\"width: 520px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2457230-walking_dead_survival_instinct-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2457230\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33529/2457230-walking_dead_survival_instinct-3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Zombies are inconsistent about how aware they are of your presence. This guy might ignore you as you creep by, or spot you from 20 feet away. You never know.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That is maybe the one germ of a good idea Survival Instinct is infected with. Instead of turning the game into a zombie killing bloodbath, Terminal Reality at least tried something different by making the encounters with the undead more overwhelming than predicated on endless zombie killing. Little details, like the game's focus on silent, hand-to-hand weaponry, and the fact that you actually sweat when running for too long (which looks awful, but apparently alerts zombies to your presence via their sense of smell), are nifty concepts that just don't play out very well in execution. In reality, the game focuses so much on non-shooting weapons that guns border on useless. They're incredibly noisy, for one, and also aren't really any fun to shoot. Even Daryl's trademark crossbow, which the game goes out of its way to fuss over when you first get it, is downright awful to use.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">So instead of running around like a zombie killing machine, you'll find yourself creeping around quite a lot, sneaking up on hapless walkers when they're by themselves, and creeping past groups whenever you can. Of course, you can't always avoid a conflict, in which case you must run to the blazes, lest the horde catch up to you. However, any real sense of fear one might feel from having an active football roster's worth of cannibalistic corpses pursuing you is largely negated when you actually find yourself up close and personal with a group. This scenario enacts a \"grapple\" mechanic where, one at a time, zombies will get all up in your face while you try to steer your knife in the direction of said zombie's face to pull off an initially brutal-looking kill move. Then you do it again. And again. And again. And again and again and again until you either screw up enough to die, or have actually killed an entire horde of zombies with only a knife and a severely broken game mechanic to thank for your life. I think I maybe killed off at least five or six major groupings of zombies this way. The rest of the time, I either managed to escape to the random green box I had to find to end the current mission objective, or died.</p><p style=\"\">I died a lot in Survival Instinct, which maybe makes it all the sadder that it only took me five, maybe six hours to finish the whole damn thing. The storytelling is spartan to the point of very nearly not existing, which means that much of the time you're spending in the game revolves around annoying resource gathering and errand missions that are not only not fun, but incredibly frustrating as the game's difficulty progressively climbs higher. Which is to say nothing of the completely pointless, and utterly unpleasant side ventures the game saddles you with between story sections. In between these sections, you are asked what route you would like to take to the next area. Taking the highway, for instance, is a faster route that also provides few scavenging opportunities for supplies, like gas and food. You need those things, because without gas, you can't get to the next destination. Whatever route you take, you'll eventually have to make a stop between missions, and these all take place in the same handful of recycled environments, with the same recycled objectives again and again. They are awful, pointless padding that offer nothing beyond a way to extend what would otherwise be a mercifully brief playtime.</p><p style=\"\">As awful as Survival Instinct is mechanically, the really depressing thing about it is that it offers no meaningful information or commentary on the characters it revolves around. Yes, Daryl and Merle's lives are a bit more fleshed out, but nothing you learn is anything you couldn't have gone the rest of your life not knowing. Even worse are the various side characters you'll pick up along the way, who you can actually chose to bring with you, or leave behind, depending on your affinity for them, and the kind of room you might have in your current vehicle. These characters exist, but that's about all they do. They're given few, if any opportunities to endear themselves to the player, and not a single one of their various death scenes elicited more than a casual shrug from me. It's hard to feel much for people who you never make any meaningful connection with, you know?</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/184038/2455021-keepaneyeout.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2455021\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/184038/2455021-keepaneyeout.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2455021\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/184038/2455021-keepaneyeout.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/184038/2455021-keepaneyeout.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Actually, this represents the final visual quality of Survival Instinct quite nicely. So shut up, screenshot disclaimer.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is perhaps why this Walking Dead was always going to suffer in comparison to Telltale's. Telltale found a way to make you care about even the most minimally present characters in your group. It crafted relationships that became increasingly complex as the episodes went along. Survival Instinct's limp attempt at similar survivor relationships doesn't even compare.</p><p style=\"\">I realize comparing what are obviously two very different games, mechanically speaking, isn't entirely fair. I also realize that Terminal Reality was likely saddled with a thankless, under-resourced task in making this game, one that has been quoted as coming together from conception to release in less than a year's time. The thing is, you can see the basic framework of a completely competent zombie game in Survival Instinct. With a stronger budget, more time, and a bit more care and craft, I could almost see this game being good. Sadly, what's ended up on shelves benefited from no such factors, leaving players with an abysmally rushed game of barely connected ideas that brings the player little more than frustration and disappointment.</p>", "deck": "This is not the Walking Dead game you're looking for.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-566/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38900/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/3030-38900/", "id": 38900, "name": "The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct"}, "score": 1, "publish_date": "2013-03-21 13:19:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-123639/", "id": 123639, "name": "The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/luigi-s-mansion-dark-moon-review/1900-567/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> has always been <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>'s secondary, the brother of a beloved hero whose own cowardice is perhaps his most clearly defined trait. We know Luigi as the scaredy-pants Mario brother, a man who is as anxious as Mario is adventurous. He's a comic relief character who rarely gets to step out into the spotlight. Maybe it's because of that fact that I so often cherish those rarified moments when he does. It certainly would explain my adoration for <a href=\"/luigis-mansion/3030-10996/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10996\">Luigi's Mansion</a> on the <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a>. What a weird and wonderfully silly game that was. Sure, it was painfully short, and barely had enough going on mechanically to qualify as more than a neat technical showpiece for Nintendo's then-new console, but it was also incredibly fun, not to mention adorably goofy. More to the point, it was the best example of the time that Luigi could very easily front his own game, if given the proper set-up and execution.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2228494-3dslmansiondm2scrn02e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2228494\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2228494-3dslmansiondm2scrn02e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2228494\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2228494-3dslmansiondm2scrn02e3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's been 12 years since Luigi last hunted ghosts. I'm sure he wishes it had been 12 more. Poor little fella.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I don't know that it needed to take twelve years for someone to make good on Luigi's Mansion's initial promise, but we should just be glad that something finally has. <a href=\"/luigis-mansion-dark-moon/3030-35572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35572\">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a> for the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS</a>, from <a href=\"/punch-out/3030-23965/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23965\">Punch-Out!!</a> developers <a href=\"/next-level-games-inc/3010-1977/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1977\">Next Level Games</a>, is a much more thoughtfully fleshed-out version of what the original game offered. It is a far more lengthy, content-rich adventure filled with pratfalls, panic, and more than enough clever puzzle solving to keep players engaged for hours. However, even better than any of that, Dark Moon is perhaps the best representation of Luigi as a character yet seen. Next Level clearly understands the tendencies of Mario's perpetually petrified twin, amplifying them to tragicomic levels of silliness.</p><p style=\"\">Insomuch as any game in the Mario universe has a plot, Dark Moon does as well. You may or may not remember <a href=\"/professor-e-gadd/3005-1776/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1776\">Professor E. Gadd</a> from the GameCube game, but no matter. He's back again, roping a deeply reluctant Luigi into another bout of ghost adventuring for the purposes of paranormal science, as well as the reconstruction of a gem called the \"dark moon,\" which has a sort of calming effect on the spectral entities than inhabit Gadd's strange little valley. Of course, a big ol' Boo comes along and cracks it, turning all of Gadd's helpful ghosts into politely anarchic poltergeists. Again, this is a Mario universe game, so nothing really \"scary\" happens, so much as the kind of comedic spookiness one might find in a typical <em>Scooby Doo</em> episode.</p><p style=\"\">But that's fine, because Dark Moon does this particular brand of ghostly humor exceedingly well. Luigi is animated with tremendous expressiveness. He quakes and chatters and shivers with fear so often that you halfway expect him to have a coronary halfway through. More importantly, Dark Moon has a great sense of comic timing. It knows how to set the player up for a good pratfall, and delivers the goods in nearly every event. What's extra great is that the game doesn't constantly pull you out of the experience to tell its jokes. Most of them are told in-engine as Luigi interacts with different pieces of the environment. The cutscene work is all good too, but I was more impressed with how the game allowed its comedic bits to build-up largely through gameplay and exploration.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Through all this expressiveness and humorous narrative, Luigi becomes an incredibly endearing character. You feel bad for the guy, knowing all he wants is to not be wherever the heck he is at that very moment. By the same token, he's presented as just capable enough to not create any weird dissonance between his success and his constant terror.</p><p style=\"\">Succeeding requires you to find all the missing pieces of the dark moon, though in-between those battles with major boss ghosts, you'll mostly be wandering around one of a few different haunted environments, looking for keys, gems, and other hidden objects scattered about by the antagonistic apparitions. Progression largely takes the form of light puzzle solving. Uncovering hidden doors, passages, and objects is your primary task, though occasionally, you'll have to bust some ghosts as well.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2423363-648443dslmansionscrn042011ev.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2423363\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2423363-648443dslmansionscrn042011ev.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2423363\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2423363-648443dslmansionscrn042011ev.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Catching ghosts isn't terribly difficult, but is nonetheless always satisfying.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Doing so is handled a bit differently than in the original game. Here, ghosts have to be stunned before you can grab them with your handy ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner. You do this with a flashlight that sends out a high-intensity light burst, which must be briefly charged before use. Once you have the ghost stunned, all you have to do is fire up the vacuum, and pull back as hard as you can against whatever direction the ghost happens to be fleeing in. While there is a fairly diverse array of spirits to battle against, the mechanics for battle largely remain the same throughout Dark Moon. Really, the only challenge is keeping away from other spirits' attacks as you battle against the ghost you're trying to wrangle.</p><p style=\"\">Which isn't to say that isn't challenging. In fact, Dark Moon can be a tough little game. The combat isn't ever<em> too</em> hard, though when you're battling against a group of ghosts, you'll have to be nimble and careful to stay out of their various attack paths. The game's puzzles can be equally tough, especially in the later goings of the game, which sometimes rely a bit too heavily on opaque environmental challenges that, despite having relatively obvious solutions in the end, don't always present the clearest path to progress.</p><p style=\"\">Really, if I have any major complaint about Dark Moon, it's that it actually runs a bit too long. That's sort of a ludicrous sounding complaint if you ever played the original game, which could be finished in just a couple of hours. However, while Dark Moon makes up for that game's dearth of content, not all of its content is all that worth playing through. Every one of the game's environments has at least one or two level sections that feel completely extraneous. Due to Dark Moon's somewhat more handheld-friendly structure, wherein you are pulled in and out of environments between levels by Professor Gadd for a quick game save, the game is forced to come up with reasons to keep pulling you in and out. While all of these scenarios are tied into the inherent mischievousness of the ghosts, eventually it gets old, especially when it starts recycling the same objectives in only moderately different environments. That the game's puzzles and gameplay mechanics are often good enough to push you past those more tedious bits with only minimal grumbling is a testament to how fun Dark Moon can be when it's at its best.</p><p style=\"\">What was really impressive to me--and I'm as shocked as anyone by this--is how Dark Moon uses the 3D capabilities of the system to its benefit. Look, I think 3D in most 3DS games is about as necessary as the continued existence of <a href=\"/waluigi/3005-785/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-785\">Waluigi</a>, but in Dark Moon, the 3D mixed with the game's diorama-style camera presentation gives every environment a sense of depth that makes exploration a great deal more fun. It's a sincerely terrific use of 3D in a time when anything 3D looks pretty much passé and annoying, so I'll understand if you're skeptical. If you do plan to play Dark Moon, just do me the one favor of at least trying the 3D for a few minutes. I don't think you'll be disappointed.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2423369-648503dslmansionscrn102011ev.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2423369\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2423369-648503dslmansionscrn102011ev.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2423369\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2423369-648503dslmansionscrn102011ev.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2423369-648503dslmansionscrn102011ev.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dark Moon presents itself with ample charm, from the top-notch visuals, to the spooky-cute soundtrack (which Luigi frequently hums to himself).</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Another neat, if perhaps unnecessary addition is multiplayer. Up to four players can take on a multilevel tower filled with ghosts and either cooperative or competitive objectives, which range from simple ghost hunts, to frantic searches for floor exits while racing against the clock. All these modes are actually pretty fun, especially when played with people who have a decent sense of what the hell they're doing. And there's even more clever animation work to be found here, with funny little bits featuring differently-colored Luigis fanning each other with their hats after they \"faint\" (run out of health), or trying to knock jars off one another after a ghost plops one down on a player's head. While I don't necessarily feel any strong need to go back to the multiplayer after a few hours of messing with it, I expect some people will like it a lot.</p><p style=\"\">Dark Moon takes what was basically a really good sketch of a game in the original Luigi's Mansion, and fleshes it out into a more robust, and arguably far more entertaining romp, all while retaining the distinctive flavor of that first game. It might overstay its welcome a bit, but I doubt anyone who loved the original Luigi's Mansion in spite of its paltry adventure length will complain too terribly much about having a lot of Luigi's Mansion to play. Especially when it's as well executed as Dark Moon is.</p>", "deck": "Dark Moon makes for a charming and challenging follow-up to Luigi's last GameCube adventure.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-567/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35572/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/luigis-mansion-dark-moon/3030-35572/", "id": 35572, "name": "Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-03-21 15:45:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-117652/", "id": 117652, "name": "Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/bioshock-infinite-review/1900-568/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25628/2398345-voxrunners_online.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2398345\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25628/2398345-voxrunners_online.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2398345\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25628/2398345-voxrunners_online.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">How do you surprise someone that's expecting a surprise?

Instead, Infinite cleverly preys on those expectations right out of the gate. It feeds you <em>just</em> enough familiar material and gameplay to make it all fit into what you think the word \"BioShock\" implies, but it strikes out in some really exciting directions, too. The combat is nicely varied and the story moves along at a pace that gives you plenty of things to piece together on your own as you get closer and closer to discover what's really going on in Columbia.</p><p style=\"\">Columbia is a floating city ruled by a man named <a href=\"/zachary-hale-comstock/3005-22154/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22154\">Comstock</a>, more commonly known as \"the Prophet,\" and its intended inhabitants worship America's founding fathers as if they were gods themselves.

These things take the form of tears in reality, small openings to... something, sometime, or somewhere else. Most of the more meaningful tears are utilized to further the game's linear story in some fairly mindbending ways. This is one of the ways that Infinite distinguished itself from its predecessor. Rather than waiting for one big moment to twist and pull the rug out from underneath you, this game starts showing you things that make you immediately start to question what you're seeing, how it is being shown to you, and what it all means. A mysterious male-female duo shows up along the way, seemingly to help you connect a few of the dots, but they also provide an effective bit of comic relief. They ended up being my favorite characters in a game filled with interesting, properly-motivated individuals and a world that draws you in until you're practically begging to know more about it.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2409692-lizbookonline.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2409692\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2409692-lizbookonline.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2409692\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/135472/2409692-lizbookonline.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Alongside your extraction mission, Columbia is falling into utter chaos and is on the brink of a full-on race and/or class war. Some factions of the city preach in favor of maintaining racial purity, and one of the game's most powerful sequences is an early scene depicting a mixed-race relationship--something the powers in control of the city most definitely frown upon. But this doesn't boil down to the typical good guys/bad guys scenario. Due to the nature of the world and the way it changes over time, you'll also see that Vox Populi's rebel forces are capable of just as much cruelty as the forces they seek to overthrow. The changing relationships between factions and the way the main characters fit into that puzzle make Infinite far more complex than the average video game story, and it's exciting to see heavier themes like these on display.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">I really could go on and on about how absorbing the world, story, and characters of BioShock Infinite are, but at some point it'd start to get into subjects and concepts that are best left until you're experiencing them for yourself. It was an impactful 12 hours that answered nearly all of the questions I had about the universe, but left one or two glaring ones that I wish I knew more about. And it wraps up with a striking sequence that adds a lot of context to everything leading up to it without simply repeating the same sort of tricks found in BioShock.</p><p style=\"\">There is a proper game pinning this thought-provoking story together, and like the story, Infinite's gameplay pulls together just enough of the original <a href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\">BioShock</a>'s concepts and combat to make it feel familiar while also maintaining its individuality. Like BioShock, Infinite is a first-person shooter with spell-casting, though you'll use \"vigors\" and work with a \"salt\" meter instead of firing off \"<a href=\"/plasmid/3055-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-24\">plasmids</a>\" and keeping an eye on your \"eve\" reserves. You can hold two weapons in your inventory and easily swap between them. Similarly, you can equip two different vigors and toggle between them by tapping a button. Weapons include a <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistol</a>, a <a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launcher</a>, a <a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">shotgun</a>, a <a href=\"/machine-gun/3055-608/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-608\">machine gun</a>, a carbine, a <a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle</a>, and other fairly basic fare, though a variety of weapon upgrades can be purchased to expand their usefulness a bit. Vigors let you do things like shoot electricity, lob fire grenades, pull enemies in towards you, charge in for a pumped-up melee attack, launch a murder of crows that distract and damage enemies, and so on. There are also trap versions of most abilities that you can place by holding down, rather than simply tapping the vigor button. I never much cared for the trap abilities in BioShock and they're not my thing here, either, but the abilities are about as useful as they were in the original BioShock.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2409694-welcomeonline.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2409694\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2409694-welcomeonline.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2409694\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2409694-welcomeonline.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2409694-welcomeonline.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Though there are optional treasures and audio logs to find in various corners and hallways, Infinite is a linear game, and you can tap up on the D pad at any time to make an arrow appear and guide you in the right direction. The game's great about pacing its combat sequences and spreading things out, giving you plenty of time to explore your well-detailed surroundings between gunfights. I found myself mostly relying on the electricity power to stun a chain of enemies long enough to shoot them all in the head with a carbine or machine gun.</p><p style=\"\">Elizabeth is with you for much of the game, but an on-screen bit of text makes it pretty clear that Infinite isn't one big escort mission and that she can \"take care of herself.\" That's only partially true, really. She'll still run into trouble, but only when the story demands it. The rest of the time, enemies just seem to ignore her completely. During combat, she'll occasionally shout out to let you know that she's found some salts, health, or ammo. You can tap a button to get her to toss the goods over. Out of combat, she'll occasionally find and toss you some money. The way the AI appears to be blind to Elizabeth's presence is one of the game's few disconnects, though at least you don't have to constantly rescue her from trouble.</p><p style=\"\">Infinite's audio is outstanding. The voice cast has turned in a remarkable set of performances, and the dialogue they're reading is well-written and believable. The music is also a top-notch collection of material performed in a period-appropriate way. Hearing a barbershop quartet performance of the Beach Boys' \"God Only Knows\" also served as one of the early clues that Columbia is a strange place, indeed. There's a lot to like about the way Infinite looks, especially on the PC, but I'll sum it up by saying that the emotional points of this story would fall completely flat if Elizabeth's face hadn't been as animated as it is. Those animations do more to sell the story than anything else.</p><p style=\"\">You'll see a lot of BioShock in Infinite, but even if you try to make direct comparisons between the two, it's clear that Infinite is a far better game than its predecessor. It moves at a better pace, with more meaningful and more playable big encounters than BioShock. But it still carries that sense of exploration and the feeling of dread that comes with knowing that everything is just continuing to unravel before your very eyes. Watching Columbia fall while attempting to take Elizabeth away from the floating city is a fantastic way to spend a few days.</p>", "deck": "Infinite keeps the soul of BioShock at its core, but it isn't afraid to strike out in some very exciting new directions.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-568/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32317/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bioshock-infinite/3030-32317/", "id": 32317, "name": "BioShock Infinite"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2013-03-25 18:44:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-103460/", "id": 103460, "name": "BioShock: Infinite"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/guacamelee-review/1900-569/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"/drinkbox-studios/3010-7162/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7162\">DrinkBox Studios</a> is quietly becoming one of the more reliable indie developers working today. Since forming in 2008, the small team has released two entries in its underrated <a href=\"/tales-from-space/3025-2208/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2208\">Tales from Space</a> series, and now has <a href=\"/guacamelee/3030-37673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37673\">Guacamelee!</a> under its belt as well. While the Tales from Space games were fun, if slight, puzzle platformers, Guacamelee! is a full on <a href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\">MetroidVania</a>-style side-scroller featuring, of all things, an adventuring luchador. It's a strange, yet incredibly thoughtful meshing of beat-'em-up brawler mechanics, elaborate and challenging level design, and an aesthetic that mixes Mexican cultural themes with DrinkBox's now-established cute cartoon art style. More to the point, it's a great deal of fun nearly from beginning to end.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/64/2173903-guac_screen_h.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2173903\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56190476190476\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/64/2173903-guac_screen_h.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2173903\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/64/2173903-guac_screen_h.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You play as Juan, a workaday farmer-turned-lucha libre superhero out for revenge. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You begin the game as Juan, a peasant farmer in a particularly colorful rendition of Mexico that is straight up crazy for lucha libre. That's maybe not too far off from the truth, since Mexican wrestlers are treated with a kind of reverence that Americans would sooner reserve for reality television stars. Anyway, Juan is not a luchador--at least, not yet. While initially just an impoverished man, Juan is forever changed when a skeletal demon comes to town and kidnaps his beloved, whisking her away to various far-flung locales in order to perform a ritual that will merge the land of the living and the land of the dead. Juan is quickly dispatched as he attempts to intervene, but a magical wrestling mask gives him the power, speed, and swagger of wrestling's elite...as well as a few <em>other</em> powers you rarely see employed in the ring.</p><p style=\"\">At its core, Guacamelee! is primarily a brawler. You run around, punching, jump-kicking, and grappling various sombrero'd skeletons, colorful dragons, spike-laden armadillos, and whatever else DrinkBox feels like throwing at you. There isn't a huge array of enemies to fight, but the game is good about introducing them slowly over time, and giving each enemy type variable powers--like attack-coded shields, and dimensional shifting between the living and dead worlds (which you can eventually switch between on the fly)--so as to keep you on your toes. As you fight through the world, you'll encounter giant statues, which you destroy to earn new abilities, like a flying uppercut, a diving punch, and a dash attack.</p><p style=\"\">These statues are maybe the most explicit <a href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3\">Metroid</a> reference in all of Guacamelee!, though really, the whole game is essentially a tribute to the classic exploratory side-scroller. There is a larger world map that you can travel through as you like, though many areas are locked until you acquire specific abilities that will allow you to traverse certain environmental obstacles. It's a good-sized world, too, filled with diverse scenery and, in the town areas, people you can talk to and take up side quests for. Unfortunately, the side quests aren't super engaging for the most part, and some of the bonus areas are among the game's most infuriatingly difficult parts. Then again, all that stuff's pretty optional anyway, as you can progress just fine through the story mostly ignoring it.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That progression doesn't take more than maybe five or six hours total, though nearly all of that time is well spent. Guacamelee! is one of those games that is thankfully utterly devoid of chaff. No area in the game feels padded or otherwise out-of-place. The flow of the campaign feels meticulous in its design, keeping the player constantly aware of where they ought to go next, but providing ample opportunity to poke around and look for hidden stuff. The level and world maps are particularly handy, which is always crucial for a game of this type.</p><p style=\"\">More importantly, the combat and level designs are good enough to keep you at rapt attention throughout the adventure. While I might have liked a few more actual wrestling moves in a game featuring a luchador, the flow of combat is tight, responsive, and delightfully combo-driven. Bosses provide a stiff challenge, but the game rarely becomes so difficult as to cause serious frustration. More often, those situations come from some of the game's tougher jump puzzles, which at times can be downright <a href=\"/super-meat-boy/3030-25114/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25114\">Meat Boy</a>-like in their sadism. Thankfully, DrinkBox relegated these mostly to a few later-game scenarios, rather than sprinkling them all over the place.</p><p style=\"\">It's worth noting that Guacamelee! does feature co-op play, though it's not really much of a draw. The tough platforming sequences can occasionally make this feature a chore, and the combat sequences don't really require a second player to be fun. Still, if you've got a friend around, they can jump into the game at any time, though it'll have to be offline as there is no online co-op support.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/64/2173901-guac_screen_f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2173901\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56190476190476\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/64/2173901-guac_screen_f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2173901\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/64/2173901-guac_screen_f.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Fights against the game's bigger baddies are tough, but the real challenge tends to emerge from the game's occasionally brutal jump puzzles.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">What stands out most about Guacamelee! are its visual and audio aesthetics. The game's art is downright gorgeous, nicely animated, and filled with lots of subtle (and some not-so-subtle) visual gags and references that longtime video game and Internet meme enthusiasts will undoubtedly pick up on immediately--though it's worth noting for meme haters that it's all just background art, and none of it impacts the actual game in the slightest. The soundtrack is, unsurprisingly, rooted in Latin music and mariachi, but it's all exceptionally well-produced and lines up beautifully with the game's visual presentation.</p><p style=\"\">Briefly, it should also be noted that Guacamelee! comes in both <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">PlayStation Vita</a> varieties, and that buying one allows you access to the other. Neither version of the game seemed markedly different from the other based on my play-throughs, and the cloud-saving between versions never failed to work as intended. Whichever version you end up playing, you should be just fine.</p><p style=\"\">Its few quirks and off moments not withstanding, Guacamelee! nails more than enough of its ideas to breathe new life into <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/lucha-fury-review/1900-394/\" data-ref-id=\"1900-394\">the once moribund lucha libre brawler genre</a>. It's short, sure, but it also doesn't wear out its welcome, focusing solely on the necessary pieces of an adventure that's often as challenging as it is thrilling. In Guacamelee!, DrinkBox has both provided a wonderfully crafted action game for old school and new players alike, and established itself as a developer very much worth paying attention to. I can't wait to see what they get up to next.</p><p style=\"\"><em><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> This review originally stated that there were no piledrivers in Guacamelee!, which is incorrect. A piledriver, as well as a few other wrestling maneuvers, are available as unlockables via the in-game store. Giant Bomb regrets the error, as piledrivers are awesome, and we would never want to imply that piledrivers do not exist where piledrivers most certainly exist. Cool?

At times, fights in Injustice look almost <i>exactly</i> like the sort of fight you'd see in MK9. The way the characters move and the cadence of the combos as fighters bounce and juggle each other around has a very similar vibe. But the way it controls and the way its various systems are implemented make Injustice feel like its own thing... and it's a pretty good thing, too. This <a href=\"/dc-universe/3025-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-138\">DC Comics</a> fighting game takes most of the modes from the 2011 MK release and rebuilds them around a lively roster of heroes and villains. The fights are flashy and full of personality, making the action stand out, and producing a spectacle worth seeing.</p><p style=\"\">Parts of the Injustice fighting system feel like they were designed with an eye toward making the game a bit more accessible for people who aren't already well-versed in fighting games. This starts with its three attack buttons of varying strength. Then there's a character power button that activates something unique for each character. For some fighters, this is very simple. <a href=\"/superman/3005-47/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-47\">Superman</a>, for example, does more damage when his power is active. <a href=\"/black-adam/3005-10152/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10152\">Black Adam</a> gets three spinning energy orbs that damage opponents that get too close. Some power up specific types of moves. <a href=\"/deathstroke/3005-7440/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7440\">Deathstroke</a> gets longer bursts of gunfire when his power is active. Others act as stance changes, letting <a href=\"/wonder-woman/3005-2301/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2301\">Wonder Woman</a> switch from lasso to <a href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">sword</a> and shield.</p><p style=\"\">From there, the systems start to get a little more dense, like a clash system that lets you wager portions of your super meter to heal or deal damage, or <a href=\"/enhanced-special-move/3015-7540/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7540\">EX moves</a> and bounce <a href=\"/animation-canceling/3015-1568/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1568\">cancels</a> that alter the properties of special moves or add a layer of combo potential, respectively. Also, unlike the Mortal Kombat games, Injustice's blocking system works when you hold back or down, rather than relying on a dedicated block button. No one part of Injustice's mechanics makes it too much to follow, but the game's deceptively simple attack buttons definitely give way to something with more depth and a higher learning curve. I also found it difficult to map all of its different buttons to a joystick in a way that felt natural and logical. You can configure the buttons however you like, so perhaps you'll find a setup that works well for you, but I ended up sticking with the standard gamepad. The game has an effective tutorial that illustrates how most of the systems function, but you'll need to get in and get your hands dirty to figure out when and why you'd want to use each of your available options.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161219/2427630-harley_phone.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427630\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"1366\" style=\"width: 1366px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161219/2427630-harley_phone.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427630\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/16/161219/2427630-harley_phone.png\"></a><figcaption>Harley Quinn makes a quick phone call from jail.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you're familiar with Mortal Kombat's list of modes, most of Injustice maps back to that game. The story mode takes the same sort of interactive movie approach, seamlessly weaving its way into and out of fights in a way that's still quite impressive a couple of years later. You'll control a handful of characters over the course of the story, which mostly seems to exist to answer the questions \"why would good guy superheroes fight other good guy superheroes?\" and \"how do those not-so-superpowered heroes survive a good pummeling from the likes of Superman?\" The answers aren't especially satisfying, but the multidimensional story juggles up the typical hero vs. villain alliances in a way that justifies having \"evil\" versions of a few heroes without seeming quite as ridiculous as the \"they're infected with RAGE\" plot that drove <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe/3030-20449/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20449\">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</a>. It's not too far off from that <a href=\"/gi-joe/3025-223/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-223\">G.I. Joe</a> two-parter where they get sucked into an alternate dimension where the <a href=\"/baroness/3005-11914/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11914\">Baroness</a> is a good guy, actually.</p><p style=\"\">\"Battles\" is where you'll get your arcade-style ladders, with additional unlockable tiers that layer different modifiers onto the fights, like one that imposes a restrictive time limit or another that gives you a random character to control for each fight. Finishing the standard ladder gets you a character-specific ending. The S.T.A.R. Labs is the Injustice take on Mortal Kombat's Challenge Tower, giving you hundreds of different objectives to complete, be they blocking challenges or the simple task of winning a fight. This time around, each challenge has three different objectives associated with it, giving you extra stars (and unlocking more of the later challenges more quickly) for completing extra tasks. So, for example, you'll get one star for using Superman to avoid <a href=\"/catwoman/3005-654/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-654\">Catwoman</a> for 20 seconds in one of the early challenges. But you'll need to land a four-hit juggle to get the second star and connect with two throws for the third... and if you get hit once, you fail the whole challenge. The advanced goals get pretty tricky, which makes it frustrating that there's a bit of load time and dialogue to button through each time you retry a challenge.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161219/2444025-green+arrow+alt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2444025\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161219/2444025-green+arrow+alt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2444025\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/16/161219/2444025-green+arrow+alt.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/16/161219/2444025-green+arrow+alt.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game is full of alternate costumes, some unlockable, though others will eventually be for sale.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The online end of Injustice also builds upon the MK framework, giving up to eight players the ability to get together and fight in King of the Hill mode, which lets the players who are waiting and spectating vote on the current fight. There's also a lobby system that lets players meet up and chat before engaging in one-on-one, King of the Hill, or Survivor mode, which is essentially a King of the Hill variant where the winners don't automatically get all their life back between fights. You can also enter an online practice session, which is a pretty cool idea for players wanting to show each other some new moves. The online mode spews a ton of fun game-related data at you via a tip feed, letting you know how many capes have been destroyed, how many times specific objects have been broken in a level, and so on. You've seen this type of stat feed in first-person shooters before, but it's interesting to see it applied to a fighting game. By and large, the online works fine when you're playing against someone with a solid set of connection bars.</p><p style=\"\">Injustice employs solid fighting systems that make it fun to play, but for many the main draw will be the game's wild super moves and <a href=\"/destructible-environment/3015-243/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-243\">destructible backgrounds</a>.

This is the sort of follow-up that's bigger than an expansion pack but far lesser in scope than a true sequel; it simply feels like a full-length game's worth of additional content shoved into the previous game's framework. The two games are so similar--Riptide reuses just about all of the first game's interface elements, art assets, and gameplay systems--you'd often find it tough to even tell which game is which. If I'd come out of Dead Island with a burning desire for more Dead Island, Riptide would go down a lot easier, but since that original game started out strong and just got weaker as it wore on, playing through another 15 hours of almost exactly the same thing, when the first one already felt like more than enough, instead just becomes a tiresome exercise.</p><p style=\"\">That first game was rotten with bugs and odd design quirks, but I was willing to forgive a lot because its strongest aspects--namely the exacting first-person melee combat, and all the loot and RPG trappings that propped it up--were so enticing. Still, despite a fantastic first act, Dead Island dragged on longer than it should have given its issues, and at least for me it had expended much of the good will it built up by the end of the game. Exactly one game's worth of Dead Island was plenty for me, so when I jumped back into Riptide and immediately felt a sense of fatigue with the gameplay mechanics after just the first few minutes, I knew it was a bad sign. Unfortunately none of the meager additions to the formula here are enough to counteract the awkward design and shoddy production values that carried over from the first game.</p><p style=\"\">There wasn't much of a storyline in Dead Island, but at least the setting was entertaining, taking a pampered tropical resort populated by spoiled rich kids and dropping the zombie end of the world right in the middle of it. There's nothing half as interesting in Riptide, as your same four survivors (joined by one new playable character) have managed to escape one island hellhole only to wash up on the shores of another one, the landscape of which looks conspicuously similar to the first one. Here you're running quests through a boring jungle, a shantytown, an old military base, and other zombie-game cliches that don't allow the freedom of movement or even compelling visual design of the resort in the first game. All of Riptide reminded me of Dead Island's weak third act, while none of it recalled that great first act, as if the designers themselves didn't realize what was actually great about their own game.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2306218-deadisland_riptide_all_all_screenshot_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2306218\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2306218-deadisland_riptide_all_all_screenshot_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2306218\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2306218-deadisland_riptide_all_all_screenshot_003.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hey, remember all these guys?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's worth noting the new things Riptide does, since there aren't many of them. There are a handful of base-defense missions that take a direct cue from <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a>'s own zombies mode, since you're running around putting up barbed wire to keep enemies out and manning gatling-gun turrets to mow them down as they try to get in. These missions are fun enough in co-op, and even when you're alone, your NPC allies do a decent job of helping control the zombie crowd (though the game still pulls the ridiculous trick of having all your ally characters pop up in cutscenes when you've been running around the entire game by yourself). There's a couple of new enemies, like the screamer, who can, well, scream to incapacitate you briefly, and the wrestler, who has a gigantic gross tumor of an arm it can swing around like a club, but you're still going to kill hundreds upon hundreds of the fodder-like infected and walkers ad nauseam from beginning to end. If you were already burned out on fighting those things from the last game, you aren't going to find it anymore entertaining here, despite the presence of a paltry few new weapons and mods (that are barely distinguishable from the ones last time around). Oh, and there are some boats to drive clumsily around the inland rivers here and there, but they hardly make up for the paucity of drivable trucks on the island.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2455672-015494.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2455672\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56148867313916\" data-width=\"618\" style=\"width: 618px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/2455672-015494.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2455672\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2455672-015494.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/2455672-015494.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Never has \"more of the same\" been more apt.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Other than the occasional base defense, most of the quest design in the game has you merely running from one place to another to grab an item or throw a switch, then moving on to the next area to do the same thing, with occasional poorly produced and dramatically bankrupt cutscenes punctuating the events of the story, such as it is. The rough production quality of the cinematics was strangely endearing in the first game in a kind of backwards way. But two games in, it's just gotten irksome, especially as this game halfheartedly makes some overtures toward the origin of this whole zombie mess before taking a hard left turn into a completely ridiculous, unearned plot twist, and then just...ending. Parts of the game are still kind of fun to play through cooperatively with friends--though, unlike in the first game, you sometimes feel like you <em>have</em> to be playing in co-op to avoid being overwhelmed by awful infinite enemy spawns--but coming from the Dead Island, getting through Riptide mostly just felt like a slog that I wanted to be done with.</p><p style=\"\">The first Dead Island was long on good ideas but short on skillful execution, and while there's still a truly great game lurking in there somewhere, Riptide is not it. It's a shame <a href=\"/techland-sp-z-oo/3010-889/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-889\">Techland</a> didn't take this opportunity to take a step back and figure out how to properly evolve this formula before iterating on the franchise again. Maybe that truly improved Dead Island will still come along someday, but in the meantime, Riptide feels like a game that didn't really need to be made.</p>", "deck": "Riptide is more Dead Island, but not better Dead Island.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-571/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38558/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dead-island-riptide/3030-38558/", "id": 38558, "name": "Dead Island Riptide"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2013-04-22 13:39:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-121142/", "id": 121142, "name": "Dead Island Riptide"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/monaco-what-s-yours-is-mine-review/1900-572/", "description": "<p style=\"\">The trouble with stealth games, for me anyway, is all that stealthiness.

The \"Pac-Man meets Hitman\" description I've often heard for Monaco fits the game to a T.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you share my sensibilities, there's a good chance you'll enjoy <a href=\"/pocketwatch-games/3010-7034/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7034\">Pocketwatch Games</a>' <a href=\"/monaco-what-s-yours-is-mine/3030-30093/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30093\">Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine</a> quite a bit. In development for something like four years now, Monaco has evolved from its early showings as an intriguing indie curiosity into a full-fledged adventure, replete with numerous characters, skills, and challenging stages to master. It's especially strong in cooperative multiplayer, where up to four players can plan, execute, and in some cases, frantically try to salvage elaborate heists that often have a tendency to go haywire, albeit often in the most enjoyable ways possible.</p><p style=\"\">There are eight characters to choose from in Monaco. Four--the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, and the Pickpocket--are available right at the beginning of the game. Over time, you'll also unlock the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker. Each of these characters has a unique skill that makes them vital for specific tasks throughout the story. The Locksmith, for instance, can push through locked doors twice as quickly as any other character; the Hacker can disable security systems by uploading viruses through any power outlet; the Gentleman can disguise himself for a set amount of time; and the Cleaner can chloroform any in-game enemy he manages to sneak up on.</p><p style=\"\">If you're playing alone, you can just pick from any one of these characters once they're unlocked. Every stage in Monaco can be beaten with any character, but some levels are definitely designed with certain abilities in mind, and some characters are just balanced better than others. The Mole, for instance, can dig through walls, and especially in the first half of the game, is exceptionally useful. Conversely, the Pickpocket, despite having a monkey that collects coins for him, is regrettably pretty useless in most key situations.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The primary goals of Monaco's many unsavory characters evolve over time, but objectively speaking, pretty much everything revolves around you getting into a heavily guarded/booby trapped area, stealing something, and getting back out. Cops, civilians, guard dogs, cameras, laser barriers, computer-locked doors, and just about every other manner of security must be navigated successfully in order to survive a mission. In addition to your primary goal, you'll also be trying to collect the many coins that have been scattered throughout each stage, all while generally trying to avoid detection.</p><p style=\"\">The thing is, you won't avoid detection forever. While it's distinctly possible that some obsessive players may be able to sneak through whole levels of Monaco without ever spooking a guard or being spotted on a camera, you really don't have to do this to succeed. When playing solo, getting detected really only means that you need to bolt to a nearby hiding spot, either in another room, or in an air duct, or even inside a nearby shrub. Enemies aren't terribly thorough in their searches, so if you're far enough out of their sight line and aren't making noise, they'll usually just wander off, and you're good to go.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/76158/2381404-monaco_2012_12_03_12_51_44_689.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381404\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/76158/2381404-monaco_2012_12_03_12_51_44_689.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381404\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/76158/2381404-monaco_2012_12_03_12_51_44_689.png\"></a><figcaption>One of the trickier parts of Monaco pertains to the game's visual perspective. You can only see areas in your character's field of view. Everything else is blocked.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Multiplayer requires a bit more strategy, given that you could have up to four people all wandering around different areas of the environment. It pays to have a plan, which is to say that it pays to spend time learning the layouts of the different stages, and have certain characters attack certain areas for maximum coin collection and minimum collateral damage. That, of course, doesn't always go according to plan. In most games, seeing your best laid plans go to pot is usually a source of frustration. However, at least in the early goings, Monaco's levels are generally bite-sized enough to avoid forcing players to restart large chunks of content, while also providing just enough challenge to ensure that when things do go wrong, they go <em>hilariously</em> wrong. Later on, as the levels become more intricate and frankly just a lot longer, those failures do become a bit less amusing.</p><p style=\"\">Obviously a disastrous outcome isn't the point of playing Monaco, but that the disastrous outcomes are, in their own way, often so very entertaining is a testament to how fun the game can be in multiplayer. Pulling off a well-constructed heist, filled with coordinated distractions and intricately executed strategy is awesome, but even having it all fall apart on you, with guards and sirens and dogs all converging on everybody, is weirdly fun too. Of course you never want to be the guy who ruined everything, but there are, thankfully, just enough ways to get yourself out of a jam in Monaco to prevent you from ever feeling like you've hopelessly destroyed everyone's chances just by screwing up once or twice.</p><p style=\"\">It helps that Monaco is a pretty simple game, mechanically. You can use a controller on the PC version if you like, but the default controls really only require movement via the WASD keys, holding the right mouse button down to sneak quietly, and using the left mouse button to use weapons and other items that pop up from time to time. These can range from simple guns to EMPs that knock out all the electronics in a nearby area. For every ten coins you pick up, you earn another use of the item you're currently equipped with, which can be very handy when you just need to get one guard out of your way to get to the next area.</p><p style=\"\">There are quite a few chapters to play through in Monaco, though you can't unlock the second volley of levels--which are essentially remixed versions of previous levels designed with more challenge, and an alternate story path, in mind--until you've \"cleaned out\" enough stages on the first. Cleaning out requires collecting all the coins in a given stage, which, especially in the later stages, is easier said than done. The earlier stages are easier to pull this off in, and in fact, I managed to clean out a few levels without really even trying too terribly hard. But those aren't the norm, and in most cases, you'll have to painstakingly scour levels to find all those coins.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/76158/2381412-monaco_2012_12_03_12_59_44_790.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381412\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/76158/2381412-monaco_2012_12_03_12_59_44_790.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2381412\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/76158/2381412-monaco_2012_12_03_12_59_44_790.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/76158/2381412-monaco_2012_12_03_12_59_44_790.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Multiplayer is the way to play Monaco.

It may not best serve the solitary brand of player, but for a cooperative group of would-be thieves, Monaco can be terrific fun.</p>", "deck": "Monaco makes for a more compelling multiplayer romp than a single-player adventure, but its charms shine through any way you choose to play it.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-572/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30093/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/monaco-what-s-yours-is-mine/3030-30093/", "id": 30093, "name": "Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-04-24 12:30:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115340/", "id": 115340, "name": "Monaco"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/star-trek-the-video-game-review/1900-573/", "description": "<p style=\"\">J.J.

Because when you think of Star Trek and video games, you immediately think of <a href=\"/james-t-kirk/3005-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-361\">Kirk</a> and <a href=\"/spock/3005-6842/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6842\">Spock </a>starring in their own cheap knockoff of <a href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-565\">Gears of War</a>, right? Right...?!?</p><p style=\"\">Which isn't to say that a third-person shooter featuring cooperative Kirk and Spock gameplay couldn't be done well, but Digital Extremes failed to realize such a concept with any measure of quality. Built as a sort of in-between story to the two Abrams films, Star Trek features Kirk and Spock trapped in a mess featuring angry alien interlopers, shadowy Starfleet politics, and a giant<a href=\"/macguffin/3015-823/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-823\"> MacGuffin </a>of a device that tears holes in the universe, powers entire planetary colonies, and probably does some other stuff the writers forgot to bother explaining.</p><p style=\"\">This is not a well-told story, mind you. It starts out promisingly enough, immediately acknowledging the last dangling problem left hanging at the end of the 2009 film, namely that of how to resettle the now nearly extinct Vulcan race. The device in question was purportedly built to help set up the <a href=\"/vulcan/3015-2079/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2079\">Vulcans</a> on a new planet, but the vile, reptilian <a href=\"/gorn/3015-7475/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7475\">Gorn</a> have arrived and simultaneously stolen the device, while infecting various human and Vulcan innocents with some kind of zombie disease. Thus, it is up to Kirk and Spock (with occasional help from the rest of the Enterprise crew) to dispatch the Gorn, get the device back, and save the day.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Fine, except for the part where nearly everything you do in Star Trek is a terrible bore. As a third-person shooter, Star Trek is at its most effective when all you're doing is shooting. The weaponry and mechanics of combat are mostly fine, in that you can effectively use cover, aiming works as it should, and there's a decent variety of secondary weapon options to play around with. Granted, even the combat isn't devoid of problems. Enemy AI is horrendously bad, often finding itself hung up on pieces of the environment, or otherwise just standing around looking in the opposite direction while you walk right up on them and start pumping phaser blasts into their idiotic backsides.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/2230506-gornface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2230506\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.52670080468178\" data-width=\"1367\" style=\"width: 1367px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/2230506-gornface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2230506\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34651/2230506-gornface.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Gorn essentially make for a cheap Locust stand-in in this Gears of War clone.

You can have a friend (either online or off) pick up the role of whichever character you don't choose to play as, and that's recommended, because having the computer pick up the slack often results in hilarious misadventures. Watch as your AI companion runs straight into a wall and refuses to stop running, no matter how many times you command him to do otherwise, or gawk as he actively ignores your desperately injured body, doing absolutely nothing while you bleed to death ten feet away.</p><p style=\"\">Fortunately, outside of the occasional ceiling opening that you'll have to help your partner boost up to, or the few doors that require both of you to mash buttons to pry them open (ugh), there's not really much cooperation required. The only time the game does anything remotely interesting with the co-op mechanics is when you're handed a transporter gun that lets you beam your partner to specific transporter pads in a zero-g environment. These transporter puzzles aren't more than a minor brain-teaser in an otherwise straightforward shooter, but any moment that actually requires minimal critical thinking is a welcome distraction in this dullard of a game. Unfortunately, that bit is tragically fleeting, and within minutes of going through that section, you're right back to lazily shooting evil lizard men.</p><p style=\"\">This lackluster adventure drags on for at least a few hours too many, mostly due to the lame number of \"go find the missing power cell\" or \"go hit the many, absurdly spread out switches to continue\" missions the game pads itself out with. It's dreadfully boring stuff, made even more dreadful by the tragic lack of enthusiasm from those forced to explain to the players just what the hell is going on. All of the major actors from the film's cast are on-hand to voice their characters, at least. <a href=\"/chris-pine/3040-28677/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-28677\">Chris Pine</a> and <a href=\"/zachary-quinto/3040-34164/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-34164\">Zachary Quinto</a> do the lion's share of the talking, and most of their dialogue boils down to them pointing out to each other (but more accurately, the player) literally whatever is going on right in front of them. Do you need to hit a switch somewhere? Then at some point, both Spock and Kirk will say aloud that one of them needs to go hit a switch somewhere, over and over, until you hit that damnable switch. The story-based dialogue is obviously a bit better, but none of the actors seem particularly enthusiastic about the lines they've been handed. Quinto sounds stiff (even for a Vulcan), and Pine's boyish charms are mostly lost amid the many weak one-liners he's been handed.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227858-startreke3201202.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227858\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227858-startreke3201202.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227858\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227858-startreke3201202.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227858-startreke3201202.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>More action in Star Trek is hardly a terrible thing, but this game has literally nothing else going on besides action. And that action also kind of sucks.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's not even a particularly good looking game, which is criminal when you consider that it has one of the most exciting visual designs of any current film franchise to work off of. Hell, half of what made <em>Star Trek</em> so great was the sheer scope and variety of the movie's visual palette. Joke about light bloom all you want, but the movie looked incredible. This game looks anything but, with atrocious animations, lip-syncing that hardly ever syncs, and crummy environments that look straight out of this console generation's earliest years.</p><p style=\"\">There are glitches and other unfortunate quirks to talk about, but those problems barely register over the din of utter mediocrity that pervades so much of Star Trek: The Video Game's campaign. Outside of a horrid, poorly-explained turret sequence in which you (barely) pilot the Enterprise in battle, there is scarcely an acknowledgment anywhere in this game that Star Trek fans might want to do something other than just run around and shoot aliens. Such a concept ultimately belies the very point of <em>Star Trek</em> in practically all of its many incarnations. But even if you can get past this strange misunderstanding of what makes <em>Star Trek</em> tick, you won't be able to get past the desperate lack of imagination and hamstrung functionality of Star Trek: The Video Game.</p>", "deck": "Set phasers to \"shun.\"", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-573/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35514/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/star-trek-the-video-game/3030-35514/", "id": 35514, "name": "Star Trek: The Video Game"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2013-04-26 08:50:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-125851/", "id": 125851, "name": "Star Trek"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/far-cry-3-blood-dragon-review/1900-576/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469219-screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469219\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469219-screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469219\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2469219-screen005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The dark, scanline-laden look of Blood Dragon really goes a long way.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Far Cry 3 was a great game, even if its story and characters were pretty lame. Taking over outposts by stealthily cutting alarms, hunting animals, or climbing towers provided terrific distractions from the main plot. So the idea of a standalone Far Cry 3 offshoot that offers more chances to get into some of this specific type of open world mischief is pretty appealing. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/far-cry-3-blood-dragon/3030-42241/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42241\">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</a> isn't just more Far Cry 3, though. It's Far Cry 3 taped onto a VHS tape, then duped over to another <a href=\"/videotape/3055-1416/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1416\">VHS</a> tape with the commercials cut out, then copied for your friends at school and played on a filthy <a href=\"/videocassette-recorder/3055-5652/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5652\">VCR</a> that's been playing illicit tapes taken from the \"steamy\" section of the local rental store. This '80s action movie twist on the Far Cry 3 mechanics has a killer aesthetic, but it flinches a little too often, resulting an a game that oscillates between dumb B-movie tropes and a self-awareness that prevents the look and tone from working as well as it should.</p><p style=\"\">Blood Dragon takes place in the far-flung future of 2007, where cybersoldiers are the norm. You play as a Mark IV model named <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rex-power-colt/3005-26034/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-26034\">Rex Power Colt</a>, and you're sent to an island to stop your former commander, who is harvesting blood from large dragons and plans to launch missiles and infect the world with... whatever it is that the blood from those dragons actually causes. The details of the story are largely irrelevant; it's the style of this retro-futuristic 2007 that matters. The whole game has a dark (almost <i>too</i> dark, at times), muddy look that's being filtered through Colt's cyber-eyes, giving the entire game scanlines. There's a small handful of main story missions to play through, and plenty of side stuff, too. Some of it, like taking over outposts, comes in from the main Far Cry 3, but nothing comes in untouched.</p><p style=\"\">Capturing outposts in Blood Dragon is a little different. The basics of eliminating all the enemies and trying to avoid alarms are still in place, but each base is surrounded by huge energy shields that keep the blood dragons out. If you like, you can sneak into the center of an outpost and lower those shields, letting you watch as the huge, mostly-flightless creatures make their way in and start stomping the computer-voiced enemy troops. Once that's done, of course, you'll still have to deal with the dragon by either killing it or tricking it into leaving the base, which automatically raises the shields again. You can lure the dragons around by throwing cyberhearts, which are looted off of the bodies of your humanoid enemies. It's like the rock throwing system in Far Cry 3, which also shows up in Blood Dragon, but for some dumb reason you're throwing <a href=\"/dice/3055-795/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-795\">20-sided dice</a> instead of rocks.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469220-screen006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469220\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469220-screen006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469220\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/87790/2469220-screen006.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are tons of robot-voiced enemies to gun down and you'll want to steal their cyberhearts once you're done.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That starts to illustrate the disconnect between Blood Dragon's '80s action movie style and its self-awareness. The game starts with a sour note by putting you through a tutorial that's too cute for its own good, forcing you to stand still and go through the basics while your character, voiced by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/michael-biehn/3040-89970/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89970\">Michael Biehn</a> (though at times his delivery is a little more <a href=\"/michael-rooker/3040-84143/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-84143\">Michael Rooker</a>), curses up a storm because he just wants to go kill stuff. All of the loading screen tool-tips try to be self-aware, too. It's like the game can't decide if it wants to lean all the way into its <em>Commando</em> and <a href=\"/robocop/3025-393/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-393\"><em>RoboCop</em></a> references or hang back and comment on the action like the game is trying to be \"above it.\" It's disappointing, because there are funny moments in both cases, but the whole thing would have been stronger if the writers could have just committed to nailing one or the other.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Other side missions let you rescue hostages or go hunting. Completing these tasks unlock the ability to buy weapon attachments, like explosive rounds for your sniper rifle or a <a href=\"/silencer/3055-489/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-489\">silencer</a> for your pistol. You'll also gain <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a> and level up, but unlike Far Cry 3, you can't spend points on a skill tree. The skills--most of which are lifted right out of the main game--are unlocked in a set order. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon isn't an especially long game, but if you attempt to wring every last bit out of the side missions and start hunting for collectibles, there's certainly more to it than the average digital release. It also has a fantastic soundtrack that fits with the retro-futuristic action perfectly.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469221-screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469221\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2469221-screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469221\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2469221-screen007.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2469221-screen007.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are outposts to overtake and just enough side missions to keep you going.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">By building on a strong base game, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon brings in a lot of the best moments from its predecessor. Stalking around and silently grabbing an enemy, then dragging his body out of sight is still pretty fun. Chaining together stealth kills and tossing ninja stars at distant enemies (which replaces the \"<a href=\"/stealth-kill/3015-2181/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2181\">stealth kill</a> one enemy then use his gun to shoot someone else\" animation from the original game) is rad. So Blood Dragon works. It also has enough completely ridiculous moments--especially near the end of the game--to make its boneheaded action movie tone work. It's just a shame that this love letter to the sorts of movies you'd catch on Showtime at 2PM on Wednesday in 1988 gets cut with so many winks and nods. Played straight, it'd be a funnier game, but like the core game upon which it is based, Blood Dragon is still great fun.</p>", "deck": "Blood Dragon has a terrific sense of style and gives you some good extra Far Cry 3-style gameplay to fool around with.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-576/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42241/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/far-cry-3-blood-dragon/3030-42241/", "id": 42241, "name": "Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-04-30 12:32:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-126650/", "id": 126650, "name": "Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/metro-last-light-review/1900-577/", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Games are a funny medium.

Metro 2033 was set in <a href=\"/russia/3035-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-38\">Russia</a>, made in the region, and <em>played</em> like it came from there. You wanted to swig from a vodka bottle to be a little closer to it--I called it “full immersion.” Just being different wouldn't be enough, though. Metro 2033 was drunk on atmosphere, and brought players to an alien place where the real and the supernatural swapped places at will. It also had terrible combat. I’m happy to report <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/metro-last-light/3030-35485/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35485\">Metro: Last Light</a> makes impressive strides there, changes that will make jumping into its world easier for those who were put off by some gameplay elements that didn't work well last time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Metro 2033 concluded with <a href=\"/artyom/3005-13169/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13169\">Artyom </a>launching a barrage of missiles at a nest of <a href=\"/dark-ones/3015-4908/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4908\">Dark Ones</a>. Ever since the bombs dropped, the survivors of the area around Moscow have been barely scraping by living underground. There’s not much food, water, or other supplies, and in addition to the mutated animals that have adapted on the surface, a new race of sentient beings capable of destroying folks’ minds with a wave of their hand is causing humanity to wonder if it’s about to be replaced. Artyom appeared to have successfully destroyed all the Dark Ones, but Last Light opens by encountering a survivor of the blast, starting a quest to learn their true nature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Atmosphere went a long way towards helping you forget the frustration of shooting things in Metro 2033. The gunplay was shoddy enough to break the illusion. I’m partial to the theory that awkward controls can actually contribute to immersion when done properly (see: <a href=\"/silent-hill/3025-356/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-356\">Silent Hill</a>), but in Metro 2033, you’re supposed to be a gunslinger with a deadly arm, and it was tough to be that guy. It takes precious few moments with Metro: Last Light to appreciate the mechanical upgrade. On a controller, the controls are much more streamlined, and allow you to swap tactics on a whim. This translates to the mouse and keyboard, as well, and reflects a general shift in combat design to encourage more than popping off rounds and hoping for the best. The way it feels is harder to describe. It just...feels like a modern shooter, and is no longer a distraction. The Metro games aren't about the power fantasy in so many other shooters, and it doesn't reinvent shooting a gun. Now, rather than fussing with the controls, you can easily fire away, and focus on surviving the hellscape.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Your survival is acutely conveyed in the first-person, a perspective that comes with a great power that few games wield very well.

There will always be something satisfying about holding left trigger to aim and holding right trigger to shoot, but that feeling dulls a little more with each game. It’s easy to think that’s all there is to it, and then a game comes along and reminds us games aren't trying hard enough. <a href=\"/mirrors-edge/3025-1376/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1376\">Mirror’s Edge</a> was one such game; Metro 2033 was another.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2482451-ryadr.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2482451\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2482451-ryadr.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2482451\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/9/93998/2482451-ryadr.jpg.jpg\"></a><figcaption>In-between the tense action, you'll explore wrecked towns and come to understand humanity's survival in the Metro.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It’s the little details that matter in Metro, and how they add up. It’s about having to put your gun away in order to manually recharge your flashlight’s battery. It’s about being asked to both reload bullets and manually pump the pneumatic tubing on a rifle that you can, oh yes, accidentally over-pump. It’s about hearing a terrifying beep from your watch, signifying there’s a minute left on your current mask filter, the only thing keeping you alive while scouring the surface for a replacement. It’s about the game employing mission markers only by asking you to check a compass, or pulling up a notebook that has the next objective written down. It’s about being in an intense firefight, blasting a twisted creature away with your shotgun, their blood splattering onto your mask, and the only way to see what’s going on is <em>literally</em> hitting a button assigned to wiping your mask off. It’s these differentiations that combine with Metro: Last Light’s oppressive and claustrophobic sense of place to transport you to a world of hope and suffering.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">And Last Light spends a surprising amount of time conveying that suffering. In Metro 2033, this largely happened through idle dialogue and inference. Last Light doesn't abandon asking players to draw their own conclusions, but it’s also far more blunt, and introduces a narrative trick that allows the game to indulge in some truly horrific moments that recall the day the bombs fell. One sequence, involving a plane, remains etched in my mind. By the end, you still don’t know why the nuclear winter was triggered, but Last Light succeeds at conveying the awe-inspiring terror of the day that changed everything. It doesn't skimp on the follies of man in the post-apocalypse, either, including a harrowing moment early on when the player quietly moves through a concentration camp run by future <a href=\"/nazis/3015-113/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-113\">Nazis</a>. In these moments and others, the player is given opportunities to help, but it’s not impressed upon them, and rarely is it tied to the unlocking of an achievement or significant player benefit. If you chose to help the citizens of Metro, it’s because you chose to reach out your hand--or don’t.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Possibly the most surprising addition are the amount of stealth sequences. It’s common to be presented with a huge room full of soldiers, and while it’s possible to fight through them, that’s a bad idea. I've been rather vocal about games with trial-and-error stealth gameplay, so there was a brief moment of panic. This was followed by a sigh of relief, as it became apparent how fast and loose 4A Games was with the concept of “stealth.” Seriously--these enemies need new glasses. It means you can waltz in front of them, so long as your hand’s indicator says you’re invisible. While it made these sequences tolerable, it robs all tension from them, and the sheer volume of the stealth sequences had me wishing the game was more punishing about playing them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">As with Metro 2033, Last Light is a technical juggernaut designed to bring the most powerful of PCs to their knees if you’re trying to max the visuals out. My modest but capable Radeon 7850, 16GB of RAM, and an i7 CPU heavily chugged at the game’s most intense moments (almost all of them were outside and included environmental effects) on the “high” settings. The <a href=\"/xbox-360/3055-1229/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1229\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-3/3055-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1463\">PlayStation 3</a> versions are acceptable ways to play the game but hardly ideal. While the frame rate holds up admirably, texture detail take an enormous hit.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2458325-metro-ll-1st-hands-on-07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2458325\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2458325-metro-ll-1st-hands-on-07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2458325\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2458325-metro-ll-1st-hands-on-07.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/2458325-metro-ll-1st-hands-on-07.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll want to gaze at the beautifully destroyed landscape, but each moment spent gazing is one moment closer to death.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">I was also bugged by an oversight that probably won’t present itself to many people reading this. I view Metro 2033 and Last Light like foreign films. I could play them with English dubbing, but as they were developed in Russia, it makes sense to play them with Russian voices and English subtitles. While I don’t expect to understand everything, Last Light doesn't subtitle a number of story moments, and not for any obvious technical reasons. It may be understandable that every piece of ambient dialogue cannot be translated because the game won’t know where the player is looking, but there are important ambient set pieces where the player’s attention would be directed nowhere else and the game fails to subtitle them at all. If not only to maintain my level of disbelief and immersion, it’s also a failure to successfully address accessibility for the disabled among us.</p><p style=\"\">To be this far without having gone on and on about how well Last Light renders the end of the world speaks to the impact of everything else. Did I mention it has the creepiest spiders since <a href=\"/deadly-creatures/3030-21128/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21128\">Deadly Creatures</a>? By its very nature of being a sequel, Last Light doesn’t feel as fresh as Metro 2033 did, but there’s still nothing else like it.

Fuse's bland art design and overall lack of personality are disappointing in the context of that initial reveal trailer, but under the hood it's still a generally well made third-person shooter with a clear emphasis on co-op and the imaginative weapons Insomniac is so good at dreaming up. But there are too few of those weapons, and a few too many irksome issues, to lift Fuse significantly above the many, many other cover-based shooters it's competing with.</p><p style=\"\">The game casts you in the role of the four smartmouthed mercenary agents of Overstrike 9, who trot around the globe, hiding behind crates and shooting at faceless armored bad guys to satisfy the whims of their paying clients. In this case, you're hot on the trail of a for-profit terrorist outfit called Raven, who's in possession of the titular super-element, one of those pesky substances that behaves in whatever ways the plot--or the characters' unconventional weapons--need it to. Each of the characters have a single exotic \"Xenotech\" weapon taped to their arm. Group leader Dalton gets a \"magshield\" that you activate with the left trigger, which stops bullets and lets teammates shoot through it for extra damage. Naya has a warp rifle that lets you paint multiple targets and then set them all off in a really satisfying chain explosion. Jacob has the most broadly effective weapon with a crossbow that shoots a sort of energy dart that vaporizes enemies and is great for headshots. And redheaded Izzy has a rapid-fire rifle that crystalizes enemies for a few seconds when you pour shots into them, after which you can easily shatter them to pieces. These guys make limp little jabs at each other as the missions progress, but there's not a lot of life in the banter nor the storyline itself, the twists of which are easy to see coming a mile away.</p><p style=\"\">You're free to play Fuse by yourself, during which you can quickly swap between characters to utilize their unique weapons and flank groups of enemies. For the first couple of missions, setting up warp chains or dropping a magshield to take cover behind is pretty interesting, but since each character is stuck with the same primary Xenotech weapon the entire game, the novelty wears off faster than it should. Each agent has a skill tree that you can put points into as you level up--and the way experience is doled out encourages you to use your weapons creatively, so you level faster--but the skill trees don't offer a meaningful level of customization. Instead, they really only offer you the choice between crit effects on your Xenotech weapons or increased damage on your regular ones, and aside from a few weapon-specific secondary abilities, each tree merely gives the same generic abilities to each agent.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2368048-fusedaltonsolo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2368048\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2368048-fusedaltonsolo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2368048\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/135472/2368048-fusedaltonsolo.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Overstrike 9 has gotten a little too serious for its own good.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"> <div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Certain aspects of playing alone turn out to be irritatingly cumbersome. Most of the time, switching to another character puts you in a compromised position where you're out of range of the action, standing straight up in the middle of a firefight, or facing a wall while a bunch of guys are shooting you in the back. The AI characters will occasionally get in your way, jump onto a turret you're trying to use, or fail to revive you when you're down. Distributing skill points requires you to manually switch to the character in question, dig through the layers of menus to get to the skill tree, then back all the way out to the action and perform the whole process over again. It's a case of a few little things that add up to a big annoyance after a while.</p><p style=\"\">Worse than those quirks, I just ended up feeling bored by the stretches of the campaign that I played through by myself. Aside from a few rudimentary climbing sequences, the entire game is one long linear sequence of large combat-oriented rooms laid out with numerous cover points and walkways. Most encounters give you a chance to knock out a stealth kill or two before the bullets start flying, but the only real choice you have is which cover or walkway you want to return fire from, and what kind of gun you want to do it with. There's so little to the storyline and such a lackluster attempt at humor on the characters' part, the endless shooting at enemies who usually sponge a ton of damage started to wear thin for me about two missions before the game was over.</p><p style=\"\">Fuse is substantially more entertaining with other people. Even though you don't have the freedom to switch around as much and enjoy all the characters' specific weaponry, playing with thinking human allies lets you actually set up intelligent combos and maneuvers that you can't pull off with the AI guys (though, aside from going for headshots with Jacob's crossbow, you're really just dumping bullets into enemies with the same old guns, sometimes through Dalton's shield). Many of the characters' unlockable secondary abilities become more satisfying to use in co-op as well. For instance, Izzy gets a throwable healing beacon that can resurrect downed allies. Playing solo, I tended to just throw that thing at my feet when the fighting got intense, but playing the tougher last couple of missions with friends, I got to feel like I was taking on a useful healing role by aiming the beacon at teammates who were down so I could bring them back remotely and get back to the fighting. Playing with a team actually lets you flank enemies, which is good since what feels like roughly half of Fuse's enemies--from riot shield-equipped infantry to big hulking robot suits with vulnerable fuel tanks on their backs--need to be shot from behind. Solo, it's hard to get those enemies to face anyone but the character you're playing, but in co-op you can actually sort of kite enemies around and draw their ire (or aggro, if you like) so others can get back there and do maximum damage.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2368052-fusegroup05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2368052\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2368052-fusegroup05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2368052\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2368052-fusegroup05.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2368052-fusegroup05.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>If you're going to play Fuse, you definitely want to play it in co-op.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Playing with friends was so much more entertaining for me that I'd go as far as to say it's the only way you should play the Fuse campaign. I actually found three players to be a nice sweet spot, since you get plenty of intelligent tactical potential but can still swap around a bit if you need to take on a different role for some reason. Co-op doesn't fully alleviate the tedium that sets in as you dump round after round into the especially resilient enemies later in the game, but it's a heck of a lot more interesting than plowing through it all alone. If you want more Fuse afterward, you can replay individual chapters to keep building up your agents. I didn't finish any one character's skill tree by the end of the story mode, and only bought three of the the incredibly expensive team perks that increase your experience intake, give you more time before bleeding out, and so on. So there's still plenty of post-game leveling-up to do, if that's your thing. The most rigorous fighting is to be had in Echelon, a wave-based survival mode with rotating objectives that you certainly want four good players for if you're going to tackle it seriously. Bringing leveled-up characters into this mode is a must, and you'll earn a bunch more experience for playing it. But Echelon is tough enough that it also exposes some of the most annoying things about the game's enemies, like the cloaked ones that are hard to see in a firefight and will disable you the second they touch you.</p><p style=\"\">Fuse's gameplay has some good ideas, but they don't carry enough weight in what's otherwise a shooter campaign the like of which you've almost certainly seen before. And it's hard not to think back to the exciting first trailer from two years ago, since many of the shipping game's most outlandish aspects would have been more at home in that highly stylized, wisecracking version that never got made. Fighting in an undersea base and a space station? An exotic Asian assassin who turns out to be someone's ex-girlfriend? A sneering Russian who shoots himself up with Fuse and grows 10 stories tall? It feels like the off-the-wall good ideas Insomniac had for that sillier game have survived, but those ideas are a bit uncomfortably at odds with the serious look and tone of the game as it is now. Fuse plays pretty well, but with smoother execution and a more cohesive identity, it would have an easier time standing out in a genre that, as this generation of consoles comes to a close, is wearing out its welcome more and more.</p>", "deck": "Insomniac's trademark creative weaponry gives a little extra oomph to Fuse's otherwise by-the-numbers third-person shooting.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-578/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35545/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fuse/3030-35545/", "id": 35545, "name": "Fuse"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-05-28 00:01:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114129/", "id": 114129, "name": "Fuse"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/remember-me-review/1900-579/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Memory can be a depressing thing.

Remember Me is a better story than a game, a mixture of Philip K. Dick-style plotting and <a href=\"/luc-besson/3040-25467/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-25467\">Luc Besson</a>'s sci-fi aesthetics grafted onto an initially nifty, but ultimately repetitive gameplay design. There are a few characters here worth caring about, a story that twists itself effectively around the troubled morality of forever trying to erase one's own painful history, and a visual palette that's absolutely gorgeous. But in-between the margins of Remember Me's best elements are sluggish combat, brainless traversal, and a fractured sense of progression and purpose. This is a game of many highs and lows, with little middle ground to speak of.</p><p style=\"\">Fortunately, one of the highs is the character you spend the most time with. Nilin is a memory hunter ensconced in the seedy underbelly of Neo-Paris' civil war. When the game opens, Nilin's memory is in the process of being wiped clean by nefarious scientists of a corporation that more or less runs the whole show. The company's Sensen technology is ubiquitous in Neo-Paris, with all walks of life sporting implants that allow them to access others' memories and dump unwanted ones. Unfortunately, it can also grant access to those with Nilin's special skills, who might be looking to play around inside of your mind.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Though Nilin has lost much of her memory at the outset, a strange voice appears and helps guide her out of the prison she's mysteriously found herself in. The helper, an omnipresent \"Errorist\" leader named Edge, tells Nilin bit-by-bit who she is, what she's a part of, and what her mission once was. It's a fairly typical case of rebellious anti-corporate terrorists looking to bring down Big Memory, but how that struggle is framed against the slowly returning memories of Nilin is where Remember Me most definitively succeeds.</p><p style=\"\">Remember Me is deliberate in its meting out of information, introducing you to other characters of varying degrees of villainy over the course of its roughly eight-hour adventure, and then proceeding to give you a bit of insight into how they came to be what they are. The characters the script bothers to flesh out are often strong presences throughout the game. However, a few too many characters are tossed into the mix for brief periods, only to be tossed aside later with nothing worthwhile learned about them. I mention this only because the story is at its best when Nilin is allowed to dig deep into these characters' motivations. Some of the less-interesting characters, like the miserable warden of the new La Bastille prison, are simply psychotic and horrible. Others, like the husband and wife duo that run the corporation, have more nuanced reasoning for how they came to be so powerful, so merciless, and so deeply destructive.</p><p style=\"\">These memories are presented to Nilin in separate gameplay sections, which task you with remixing defining memories in their lives. There's not much to it, in that you essentially just rewind the memory until you find exploitable glitches, which you can then use to completely alter the scope of what's happened. Though it amounts to little more than a bit of extra button-pressing, the consequences of those changes become immediately apparent, and result in some of the more thoughtful storytelling moments in the game.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2428675-rememberme_42.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2428675\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2428675-rememberme_42.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2428675\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/135472/2428675-rememberme_42.jpg\"></a><figcaption>...Unfortunately, too much of Remember Me revolves around inelegant combat and repetitive traversal puzzles.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, not enough is done with these memory remixing sections to make them more than an occasionally meaningful distraction. The rest of the time, you're punching and jumping your way through the various slums, skyscrapers, and scientific facilities of Neo-Paris, taking on enemy soldiers, robots, and Leapers. Leapers are essentially memory junkies, grotesquely deformed dregs of this futuristic society that can scarcely hold a coherent thought, and lash out at anyone not similarly deformed. The Leapers are a sad, tragic enemy that nonetheless never evolve into a more consistent threat than anyone else in the game. They, like the soldiers under the company's employ, simply lash out at Nilin every time you enter a battle arena, and proceed to die at your hand.</p><p style=\"\">Were the combat better, or at least better-paced, fighting them might have been a more engaging experience. As it stands, hand-to-hand fighting is largely Remember Me's weakest link, a hodgepodge of basic button-mashing combos made far more complex by a system that requires precision and trial-and-error to be most effective. Each move Nilin learns can be manually placed in the structure of a larger combo. There are four distinct attack varieties, each which does something a bit different, bonus-wise. Some attacks help restore health, while others reduce the cooldown time on Nilin's special moves, which can range from intense blasts of memory disrupting energy, to circuit-scrambling attacks that bring robotic enemies over to your side.</p><p style=\"\">It's a nice idea, but it falters in execution. Each hit requires a fairly precise timing to continue to the combo string, and the volume of enemies you often face simply doesn't allow for much precision in your fighting at all. Nilin's attack animations also have a tendency to run a bit long, which makes parsing out the combo timing a real pain early on. Eventually you'll get the hang of it, but it never becomes much fun to fight, no matter how tricky the enemies eventually get.</p><p style=\"\">The rest of the game is peppered with traversal puzzles and the occasional actual riddle to be solved. These suffer from a similar problem of repetition to the combat, where you simply find yourself darting from highlighted ledge to highlighted ledge, or solving the same basic door-opening puzzles over and over again. Granted, there's no reason to really explore Neo-Paris much, outside of a few collectibles and other hidden bric-a-brac. But even still, the fact that the game essentially tells you exactly where to go at all times is emblematic of Remember Me's unwillingness to let the player off the leash. All the game's levels are linear to a fault, often rather cramped, and frankly just not that interesting to explore.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2330573-rmtgsscreenshot01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2330573\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2330573-rmtgsscreenshot01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2330573\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2330573-rmtgsscreenshot01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2330573-rmtgsscreenshot01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Manually building your own combos sounds neat, but the actual fighting mechanics aren't strong enough to make it worthwhile.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's too bad, because Remember Me's art design is phenomenal.

Sadly, the plot and the game design never quite enmesh, leading to fascinating moments being broken up repeatedly by mechanics that just aren't much fun to slog through.

Who is good? Who is bad? Do such distinctions matter in a world gone crazy? The Last of Us is a bold work, especially for a developer recently known for strapping us into cinematic roller coasters. The Last of Us is not fun, at least not in the traditional sense, and that's exactly why it's so interesting.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/2483958-run.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483958\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/2483958-run.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483958\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/2483958-run.png\"></a><figcaption>Some infected can't detect light, giving you a tiny advantage.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The Last of Us is Naughty Dog's take on the <a href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">zombie</a> apocalypse. Here, the disease is fungal. Breathe in nearby spores, and you'll turn. If you're bitten or scratched by an infected? Same fate. It's not clear where the infection came from, but like <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-walking-dead/3030-34205/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34205\">The Walking Dead</a> and <a href=\"/metro-2033/3030-20964/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20964\">Metro 2033</a> before it, The Last of Us isn't concerned with exploring why the apocalypse came to be, but what happens in the days after. Humanity followed a familiar playbook when the crisis broke out. Sections of society have holed themselves up in military cities where citizens deal in ration tickets. The infection is still present, and there's no prospect of change. We're quickly introduced to <a href=\"/joel/3005-21586/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21586\">Joel</a>, who led a stressful but normal life with his daughter and brother before all hell broke loose. Twenty years later, Joel's changed. He's survived, but it's taken a toll on him. Joel's partnered with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tess/3005-26448/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-26448\">Tess</a>, a firecracker who'll just as quickly bust your lip as help you across the street. The two have similar values, so they get along. A series of events put them in charge of <a href=\"/ellie/3005-21585/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21585\">Ellie</a>, a young girl that needs to be transported to the Fireflies, a militia group trying to establish order.</p><p style=\"\"> <div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/uncharted-2-among-thieves/3030-22420/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22420\">Uncharted 2: Among Thieves </a>remains one of this generation's most celebrated games. Bombastic, sarcastic, over-the-top, <i>fun</i>. It was Naughty Dog's legacy of technological prowess with a character of matched ambition. Uncharted also popularized the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludonarrative\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">ludonarrative dissonance</a>, wherein the character portrayed in cutscenes doesn't match the one players control. <a href=\"/nathan-drake/3005-162/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-162\">Nathan Drake</a> is an aloof everyman that's easy to relate to, a man one suspects doesn't take killing a man for granted. Yet, over the course of three games, Drake leaves thousands of bodies in his wake, and never bats an eye. We <i>know</i> why this disconnect exists: in service of fun. The gunplay in Uncharted was enjoyable, and fighting off waves of enemies was, besides platforming, the core gameplay. The series was also famous for its setpieces, orchestrations of madness and destruction on an unparalleled scale. You were often in control of these moments, and if you happened to mess up a simple jump, the sequence started over. A crumbling bridge is tense and exciting the first or second time around, not not nearly as much when playing it a tenth time.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">The Last of Us rejects all of this. The Last of Us plays like Naughty Dog internalized the biggest design criticisms leveled against its last franchise and set out to make the anti-Uncharted. While The Last of Us retains Naughty Dog's signature ability to push hardware further than anyone else--a <a href=\"/playstation-3/3055-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1463\">PlayStation 3</a> game has never looked better--it gives the player far more agency during the game's biggest moments, ratchets down the overall body count by a significant degree, and tries to make each kill worth a damn.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">The developers achieve this by attaching weight and consequence to your actions. Early on, it's a brutal, difficult game. The more powerful infected have one-hit kills that aren't counterable until later, and a single pistol shot will lop off one-third of your health. Health does not regenerate in The Last of Us, and one must craft or collect new medical packs that are slowly applied in real-time before regaining any vigor. It's possible to clear sections of every threat, but that's a great way to wind up with no ammunition, little health, and not much else to show for it. In many situations, the best option is to run away. (It's possible to simply restart encounters, but I found this to quickly diminish the threat of being caught and having to improvise.) The Last of Us asks players to fight their usual compulsions when it comes to playing a video game focused on enemy confrontation, and make on-the-fly judgement calls that don't have clear risks or rewards when you initially take them. If you worry about checking every room and looking around every corner, have fun dying over and over again. Then again, some of the game's best crafting pieces, ammo, and other collectibles are hidden in those places. Is it worth the risk? Your call.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2124620-10_9_610x343.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2124620\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56229508196721\" data-width=\"610\" style=\"width: 610px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2124620-10_9_610x343.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2124620\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2124620-10_9_610x343.png\"></a><figcaption>Ellie and Joel aren't friends when The Last of Us begins, and their relationship only grows more complex.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">By holding down L2, Joel crouches to the floor and uses sound to gain a sense of what's around him, highlighted in black-and-white. It's not a supernatural ability, but a visual extension of Joel's 20 years of hardened experience. Joel's perception changes as the enemies move, and if an enemy hasn't yet made a sound, you'll have to place them in sight or prod them. Bricks and bottles are scattered around, and you'll use them often, as the infected and humans react to sound (sometimes to an exaggerated, unbelievable effect). Joel can and must use distractions to make quiet killing easier--players choose between a loud choke-out or shivving--or to sneak along. The same objects are useful on the offensive, as well. In one sequence, a building with six or seven enemies was too much for me to take on without using up most of my available pistol ammunition. One false move during a stealth kill later and everyone was alerted. Noticing the exit to my left, I ran. The exit itself was guarded by a beefy dude with a shotgun, though, and I tossed a brick at his face to stun him. This allowed me to run by, head around the corner, and avoid unnecessary combat with a whole room full of bad guys. Did I miss an opportunity to loot a safe or collect extra materials to upgrade my bat or build a bomb? Probably. But I also came out alive.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Staying alive is a balancing act that requires more than a steady aim and calculated movement. Crafting plays a huge role, one that comes with its own checks and balances. Players have a small amount of craftable items that unlock over the course of the game--molotov cocktails, health kits, smoke bombs, melee upgrades, others--but each requires multiple materials, and making one item will inevitably mean you cannot build another. Are you confident you'll make it through the next section without a scratch? Is it more important to kill the four infected blocking the way with a molotov cocktail? Like healing, crafting takes time, which is precious in The Last of Us. Once the bullets start flying or the infected start chasing, there are rarely moments to sit down, open your backpack, and wait for a bar to fill, signifying the creation of a new item. Crafting speed, healing speed, and other techniques can be upgraded by collecting medicine during the game, but nothing will make you all-powerful. Death is always around the corner.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Ellie is a key component during much of the game, as well. She's not just a character you talk to, but someone who takes part in the action. This would raise red flags in most games. Thankfully, it works fine--she's helpful. In addition to Ellie, there will be other characters following you around, shooting enemies, and hiding behind desks. They won't get in your way, and while it's a little weird when enemies don't notice these characters walking right in front of them, that's preferable to having them constantly messing up your approach. The characters are not in your control, but they're also useful and resourceful.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">At times, The Last of Us feels like a classic survival horror game, and it prompted certain personal instincts to kick in. In games like this, I'll hoard everything, use very little, and find myself at the end of the game with a glut of items, weapons, and other stuff that the game never forced me into a position of using, so I never did. If the game isn't going to back me into a wall and force the use of precious cargo, I'm going to be cautious and make sure I'm stocked up. The Last of Us deeply constrains the player in the early hours, but if you're like me, that no longer becomes an issue in the latter half of the game. Joel is capable of holding more than half-a-dozen weapons at once, and while the game does an admirable job of ammo limiting certain weapons for long stretches of the game, I eventually hit a point where I wasn't thinking about the weapon I was wielding. The game's early hours are the most harrowing, and it's why I'd recommend players interested in a rougher experience consider dialing up the difficulty before diving in.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Maybe it's the nature of a lengthy video game, but despite its restraint, the bodies start to stack up in The Last of Us. Eventually, the violence is no longer appalling, the kills no longer shocking. It's partly due to Naughty Dog indulging in Uncharted-like setpieces that transform enemies into shooting galleries. One has dozens of guys swarming a sniper spot, and you're forced to kill them in a clinical and detached fashion at odds with what's come before it. And you have unlimited ammo. It's a moment engineered to feel indulgent, as the player has been slowly sneaking through a town to eliminate a sniper that's been a total jerk, but it doesn't work. When the last enemy had hit the ground, I was rolling my eyes instead of being relieved. But players may react to these moments differently, largely fueled by the agency Naughty Dog gives them in determining the kind of survivalist Joel is.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2080122-tlou3_1_1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2080122\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2080122-tlou3_1_1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2080122\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2080122-tlou3_1_1024x576.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2080122-tlou3_1_1024x576.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Born into a chaotic world, Ellie's learned to act above her age.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The emotions are heightened by the believable acting happening in-game and out. The performance capture techniques that made Drake, <a href=\"/victor-sullivan/3005-1833/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1833\">Sully</a>, and friends come alive in Uncharted are put to terrific use in here, with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/troy-baker/3040-93651/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93651\">Troy Baker</a> and Ashley Johnson both fully committing to their roles as Joel and Ellie. Contrary to most games, Joel is not the player surrogate--Ellie is. You empathize with her, and she says what the player is thinking. When she tells Joel to fuck off, you want to give her a high-five. (At one point, you actually can press triangle and give Ellie a high-five!) Ellie can hold her own. Joel's perspective has been warped, and yet this is the guy you play as--the asshole. You don't choose how Joel acts. Naturally, there's much more to Joel that's explored as the story goes along--the man has his reasons for being bitter--and some of the best moments don't even happen in the cut-scenes. Every once and a while, Ellie (or another character) will have an icon appear above their head, suggesting an optional piece of dialogue. Often, these moments occur while Ellie is staring at a painting, poster, or another piece of scenery. Joel lived for years before the world imploded, while Ellie only knows chaos. These moments inform the larger fiction of The Last of Us, and bond Joel, Elile, and the player. If you choose to ignore these moments, Ellie comments on your decision to ignore her. It's a nice touch, and the interactions evolve as the game goes on. Early in the game, Ellie is learning how to whistle. By the end, she's gotten pretty good.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">On top of all of this, Naughty Dog has built on the surprising success of Uncharted's multiplayer with factions mode in The Last of Us. You want to know the crazy thing, especially coming from a guy who usually can't give a crap about a game's multiplayer modes? It's great. The methodical, slow-paced gameplay from the single-player translates well to multiplayer. In both game modes, players are split into small teams, and working with one another is not only essential to survival match-to-match, but it plays into the larger metagame. In Factions, you're the leader of a small set of survivors just barely getting by. In order to unlock more perks and customization options, that group needs to get bigger, and as the days and weeks roll on, random incidents will occur to test your group's ability to cope. For players, this means trying to accomplish certain subgoals within matches, such as \"x\" number of melee kills. As the group gets bigger, it demands more resources. You only find those resources during matches, and you receive more of them if you're doing more than killing--healing others, gifting items, etc. There's even an interesting, non-spammy option for Facebook that names survivors after friends and family. One thing that kept with me, though, was multiplayer's focus on rewarding gruesome execution kills. When a player is almost dead, they go into a hunched state where a teammate can rescue them--or an enemy can end their life in a terrible way. Unlike single-player, there's no terrifying us-versus-them mentality contextualizing these alarming acts. Here, it's more points and a bothersome use of extreme violence.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">The Last of Us is not simply Uncharted with zombies, but it couldn't exist without Naughty Dog having made Uncharted first, either. It's a dark adventure, one rarely filled with laughs or joy. There are bitter pills to swallow along the way, and nothing is taken for granted, not even characters. People live, people die. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. It's still a zombie game, but a sobering one.

That isn't to suggest there isn't room for nuance with the character. Though at times he's been presented as little more than a attention deficient 12-year-old boy in an adult murderer's body, there have been cases where the character has been presented as a bit more than a simple collection of crass one-liners and hit-or-miss slapstick gags.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1708/2427256-mkh4go8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427256\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1708/2427256-mkh4go8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427256\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1708/2427256-mkh4go8.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Deadpool's problem isn't that it fails to capture the character's essence.

This is the puerile Deadpool we've seen time and time again, a motor-mouthed maniac who acts like he might explode if he stopped talking for even a second. Plunked down in his very own third-person action game, Deadpool acts as a sort-of-parody of third-person action games, with its hero regularly commenting on various video game tropes, his displeasure with High Moon's script, and even you, the player, when you aren't performing to his expectations. There's nothing inherently wrong with this concept, and handled with a bit more care and craft, Deadpool could have been an enjoyably ludicrous romp. Instead, Deadpool's various technical problems, coupled with a script that can't get out of its own way, sour what little enjoyment there is to be had.</p><p style=\"\">Deadpool opens with so much fourth-wall breaking dialogue that you'll be forgiven if you're utterly exhausted with it before it even hits the 30-minute mark. Deadpool explains that he has been given his own video game, and he's pretty excited about this. He talks about this a lot, because that's what Deadpool does. <a href=\"/nolan-north/3040-80008/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\">Nolan North</a>, who has voiced the character in other Marvel games, goes for a kind of scenery-devouring mania throughout the game as he voices Deadpool, the dual voices in his head, and even Nolan North as himself. It's a performance that will delight those who adore Deadpool for his most addled dialogue and flagrant sexual jokes, and completely alienate anyone who isn't totally on board with having an ADHD-fueled psycho constantly screaming half-funny lines whether they belong there or not. It's a terrific performance of a nearly intolerable character.</p><p style=\"\">Understand, I don't hate Deadpool as a character. There have been multiple comic storylines I've quite enjoyed his presence in. But the versions of Deadpool I tend to enjoy are the ones that dial back his absurdity a notch or two from the shrieking nonsense this game so gleefully wraps itself in. Which isn't to say there aren't funny bits in Deadpool, but none of them really hit until later in the game, when the story relaxes into a bit more of a traditional progression and lets the level designs do the gag work, rather than making North beg for laughs by screaming the words \"chimichanga\" and \"fuck\" strictly for their presumed hilariousness. An early bit featuring X-Force leader <a href=\"/cable/3005-4805/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4805\">Cable</a>, and an extended sequence featuring Deadpool's on-again/off-again love interest Death are of particular note, though these moments of goofy inspiration seem almost alien compared with the rampant idiocy and braindead gameplay throughout the rest of the game.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1708/2427252-i3a15mx.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427252\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1708/2427252-i3a15mx.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427252\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1708/2427252-i3a15mx.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are moments of inspired violence in Deadpool, but most of the combat just revolves around button-mashing and dull shooting against constant waves of dumb bad guys.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I think I might have been able to stomach some of the lousier comedy moments a bit more if Deadpool played better. Unfortunately, this game is all over the place. Unsurprisingly, Deadpool's primary mechanic involves wanton murder--he is an assassin, after all. You'll start out with his trusty swords and a pair of pistols, and over time you'll be able to upgrade those weapons, as well as add more stuff (shotguns, sais, giant hammers, and so on). Yet while there is some variety to the weaponry you're given, the core fighting mechanics are hopelessly dull. Most battles are just protracted arena fights, with scads of enemies blindly running at you in place of any kind of thoughtful challenge.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">There's nothing inherently wrong with the occasional brainless kill-'em-up, but Deadpool's clunky controls do it no favors. Basic combat is fine, if a bit unwieldy when trying to fight off groups of larger, more attack-heavy enemies. The camera tends to box you in if you're anywhere other than the most open space the game is capable of giving you, meaning you'll find yourself trying to dodge and teleport around just in the hopes of staying out of a bad guy's way, usually only to find yourself getting blasted from another enemy somewhere entirely off-screen. The platforming sequences are markedly worse, marred by a woefully imprecise jump that results in a lot of missed ledges, and the occasional bout of getting stuck in the scenery.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/2451329-screen+shot+2013-03-07+at+1.50.59+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2451329\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.55213435969209\" data-width=\"1429\" style=\"width: 1429px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/2451329-screen+shot+2013-03-07+at+1.50.59+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2451329\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/2451329-screen+shot+2013-03-07+at+1.50.59+pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/2451329-screen+shot+2013-03-07+at+1.50.59+pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's probably a totally decent Deadpool game to be made eventually. But this Deadpool game? This ain't it.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That last bit happened to me a couple of times, and each time I had to reset to the last checkpoint. That's not even the most obvious technical issue the game suffers from, either. Certain boss fights refused to trigger; various enemies would often stand perfectly still, frozen in some half-animated pose while I pumped bullets into them sans resistance; at least two cutscenes simply cut off part of the way through without any button pressing on my part; and dialogue has a terrible tendency to cut itself off. That last part is especially bad during gameplay, where story dialogue and in-action one-liners will essentially overlap and obliterate whatever element of comic timing there may have been.</p><p style=\"\">Combine those problems with the game's generally chuggy, unattractive visuals, generic-as-hell soundtrack, painfully obnoxious late-game difficulty spike, and breezily short campaign (I beat most of it in a single afternoon), and you've got yourself a game that really doesn't offer much to anyone, outside of the most dedicated fans of the Merc with the Mouth. While I can usually get behind forgiving some problems in the face of quality fan service, Deadpool's fan service is highly specific to those who want the character taken to the most hyperactive extremes imaginable. Maybe that particular subset of fans will be able to look past the game's issues more easily, but anyone else will likely find Deadpool intensely grating and largely frustrating in equal measure.</p>", "deck": "The Merc with the Mouth is accurately realized in this otherwise clunky action game, though that might be more curse than blessing.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-581/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39010/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/deadpool/3030-39010/", "id": 39010, "name": "Deadpool"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2013-06-26 12:31:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127450/", "id": 127450, "name": "Deadpool"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/civilization-v-brave-new-world-review/1900-582/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Calling <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sid-meiers-civilization-v/3030-30057/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30057\">Civilization V</a>'s latest (and last) expansion <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sid-meier-s-civilization-v-brave-new-world/3030-41935/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41935\">Brave New World</a> was an interesting, if not wholly accurate choice. We're now three years removed from Civ V's initial release, and a year from the last big expansion to overhaul this world-dominating strategy game. Brave New World is a bigger expansion than the last, and a more targeted one. It aims to revamp the sometimes tepid and mundane late-game elements with reworked culture mechanics, additional monetary resources, and a whole new method of diplomacy between civilizations. These are all changes that make perfect sense, and mostly manage to achieve <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/firaxis-games/3010-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-361\">Firaxis</a>' goal of a better, less predictable late-game push, without making any major fundamental changes to the way Civ V is generally played. In this regard, Brave New World is perhaps less a brave step forward for this aging title, and more a sensible one. Then again, Sensible New World doesn't have quite the same ring to it, I suppose.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1081/2469045-2713345240-46425.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469045\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56171875\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1081/2469045-2713345240-46425.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469045\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1081/2469045-2713345240-46425.jpg\"></a><figcaption>New civs, new mechanics, and new scenarios make up the content of Civilization V's latest expansion.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The most significant change to the core game is the addition of trade routes. Maybe it's just because I'm terrible at resource management, but I often found myself running into financial trouble in previous iterations of this game, especially once I started expanding further and further, building more roads, and so on. Trade routes make for an exceptional boon to players that tend to find themselves financially strapped, without just making it overtly easy to gain gold at all times. With these trade routes, you'll build either a land caravan or cargo ship to travel to other civs, city states, or even your own cities. You won't get gold if you travel to your own cities, but you can create food or production bonuses. Outside of your own empire, you'll receive nice gold bonuses (especially after you've built a caravansary in your originating city), apply religious pressure, and even gain some small science boosts from certain empires. The risk is that trade routes are easily plundered. Going to war all but assures your trade routes will get swallowed up, and early on, when barbarians are still a frequent risk, you'll have to make sure your routes are regularly clear.</p><p style=\"\">These trade routes are extremely important for every civ in the game, but several of the nine new civs added for this expansion, which include Morocco, Portugal, and Venice, focus largely on wealth acquiring and trade bonuses. Unfortunately, few of the new Civs feel particularly creative or unique within the greater scope of the dozens of other civs already present in the game. The Zulus and Assyrians, for instance, are both traditionally warlike cultures to add to the already lengthy list of those, while the Polish do little of note except collect extra social policies at the beginning of each new era. Not all of them are this way, of course. Morocco probably makes the best use of the new trade elements, while Venice has the distinction of being the only playable city state. With Venice, you cannot create settlers nor annex cities, but you can use a Merchant of Venice unit to \"buy out\" city states and make them puppets. Unlike other puppet states in the game, you can purchase buildings and units for them, which gives you a bit more control than you'd otherwise have, while still preventing you from traditional expansion.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2516536-2516535-2455546-2691686348-pic3..jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2516536\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.57625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2516536-2516535-2455546-2691686348-pic3..jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2516536\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2516536-2516535-2455546-2691686348-pic3..jpg\"></a><figcaption>Cultural victories are much easier to achieve now, thanks to the new diversity of great artists, writers, and musicians.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Still, while not all the new civs are especially great, nearly all the mechanical changes made are to the game's benefit. Cultural victory, for instance, is no longer tied to the nebulous \"utopia project,\" but rather through cultural influence that can only be earned through copious amounts of earned culture and tourism. You earn both those by spawning great artists, writers, and musicians, who each can create great works that will display in the museums, opera houses, amphitheaters, and great wonders you build in your cities. Each great work provides a culture boost, as well as a tourism boost. Tourism is essentially just a new metric that determines how desirable your empire is to visit. Early on, you won't get much tourism at all, but as you get past the industrial era, you'll start building tourism in large chunks. You can actually win through tourism by dominating that category, at which point you'll see a menu start ticking off civs that have become influenced by your culture. You'll even get some world leaders coming to you complaining that their citizens are wearing your blue jeans and listening to your pop music all the time.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The only problem with the tourism victory is that you really don't get the bonuses needed to gain that kind of influence until the very end of the game. By that point, you'll probably have already achieved some major progress toward scientific or diplomatic victory. That diplomatic victory, by the way, comes via the new world congress, which eventually evolves into the United Nations. Long before you can win the game, all still-active civs will be able to start voting on worldwide measures and laws that can have huge impact on the late game. If you're feeling friendly, you can simply suggest civs put resources toward a world's fair, or international games, which will afford the winners policy and tourism bonuses. If you're looking for more targeted measures, you can propose measures that will increase great scientists, or great artists, depending on which victory you're working toward. And if you're feeling antagonistic, you can vote to ban certain luxury resources that are key to other civs' survival, or even vote to embargo all trade with them.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1081/2469060-9433570598-45557.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469060\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6123301985371\" data-width=\"1914\" style=\"width: 1914px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1081/2469060-9433570598-45557.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469060\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1081/2469060-9433570598-45557.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1081/2469060-9433570598-45557.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Maintaining a number of active trade routes is key to keeping your civ's financial coffers full. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All that diplomacy and cultural influence also plays into the game's new ideologies, which are expansions from the previous cultural policies. Once a civ has either entered the modern era, or built three factories, you'll be able to choose an ideology from the options of freedom, autocracy, or order. Those obviously existed in the previous versions of the game, but here they've been split out into their own, much larger branches and tiers of policies. One of the key elements to ideologies is making sure your ideology is the dominant one in the world. If you choose, say, autocracy, but multiple other civs choose freedom, you'll have to ensure that your culture is the strongest of the world, otherwise your citizens will begin to revolt and unhappiness in the empire will spread quickly. You can change your ideology later if you like, though that comes with its own set of penalties. If you opt not to change and your citizenry become too unhappy, cities may actually revolt and join another civ. It's an exceptionally careful balance to maintain, but if you play smartly, you'll dominate your opponents.</p><p style=\"\">All of these changes serve to make Civ V's late-game a much more enjoyable endeavor. The inevitability of victory is greatly lessened, and it's entirely possible to totally throw the established order of things into disarray if you happen to get some big tourism and/or culture boosts later on. For those reasons, Brave New World is easy to recommend to anyone who still has an active interest in the game. The new civs and added scenarios (which include the mostly throwaway Scramble for Africa and Civil War additions) might not bowl anyone over, but from a purely mechanical perspective, Brave New World's additions make this the ideal version of Civilization V.</p>", "deck": "\"Brave\" isn't the right word for this last Civ V expansion, but it sure does offer up a lot of smart changes and upgrades.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-582/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41935/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sid-meier-s-civilization-v-brave-new-world/3030-41935/", "id": 41935, "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization V: Brave New World"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-07-17 11:37:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127516/", "id": 127516, "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization V: Brave New World"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/shadowrun-returns-review/1900-587/", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/shadowrun-returns/3030-37894/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37894\">Shadowrun Returns</a> would not exist without <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/kickstarter-funded/3015-7378/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7378\">Kickstarter</a>, but the moment a game leaves the Kickstarter station, its crowdfunded background no longer matters.

I don’t know why this is, and Shadowrun Returns never really explains it, either, which is indicative of problems within Shadowrun Returns that run far deeper than the premise. (Wikipedia tells me the world suddenly shifted in 2011, with magic becoming part of the world, and parts of the human population randomly becoming orcs and trolls. Children became a mix of human, elves, dwarves, and other things. Who cares? It’s cool.)</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Whatever one makes of the universe’s mixtape elements, it sets the strategy game up for a wide diversity of play that makes the goofiness worthwhile. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/shadowrun/3025-795/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-795\">Shadowrun </a>games produced for <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES </a>and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis </a>took RPG elements from Shadowrun’s tabletop origins and combined it with fast-paced, real-time action gameplay. Shadowrun Returns adopts a much slower pace that will feel immediately familiar to anyone who’s played <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xcom-enemy-unknown/3030-37152/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37152\">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a> or<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/fire-emblem-awakening/3030-36394/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36394\"> Fire Emblem: Awakening</a> in the past year. Viewed from an <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric </a>perspective, players control teams of one-to-four characters, with one being your primary character and the others often hired goons. Players choose from a set of races--human, elf, dwarf, orc, troll--and assign one of several classes--street samurai, mage, decker, shaman, rigger, physical adept--that automates early stats. You can opt to not choose a class, but entry level players may feel overwhelmed by the sheer choices in stat selection.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Races define certain characteristics, and classes refine that even further. Unfortunately, pick carefully and do some research ahead of time, as Shadowrun Returns does precious little to prepare players for the consequences of their decisions. I went with an elf mage specializing in rifles, given that my spells would already be slung from a long distance. Why? Because it was easy to understand what it meant to play that class. Little did I know there’s a difference between traditional magic and conjuring, another form of magic meant for shamans. Woops, that's a wasted a set of karma (upgrade) points! Did you know deckers (hackers) can access terminals throughout the world, playing in a separate reality that can manipulate turrets and security cameras? Until the game forced a decker upon me during a mission much later in the game, I sure didn’t.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">About halfway through the game, I finally came to grasp the breadth of what Shadowrun Returns had to offer, and found myself profoundly disappointed at some of my decisions, choices made in ignorance. Shadowrun Returns primes players to play the way they actually want to during a second playthrough, but only because it spends so little time explaining its nuances. I understand not wanting to include a two-hour tutorial to walk players through every detail, but giving players the option to learn that for themselves would have been useful.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-7730\" data-src=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/quick-look-shadowrun-returns/2300-7730/\" data-width=\"854\" data-height=\"480\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/7730/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">But when the game finally clicks, it <em>clicks</em>, and there’s so much to play with. The battlefield is a toy box. Every class approaches combat so differently, and this makes encounters ripe for discovery (which, sadly, it actively discourages, but let’s talk about the ideal scenario). My favorite lineup was a mage, rigger, street samurai, and whatever class I hadn’t touched yet. Riggers are robotics experiments, capable of sacrificing their turns to different types of controllable drones. Some drones are mobile medics, others are gun-toting mercenaries. Their tiny stature means they’re able to sneak through vents, setting up all sorts of wrinkles in your tactics. I’d use my drones to suck up aggro from enemies, buff up my street samurai through my mage, and send that sword wieldin' maniac into the thick of battle, slicing down fools left and right. My street samurai would often be hiding in plain sight, while everyone else took cover around the world. Cover and movement works similarly to XCOM, with the mouse hovering over environment tiles and communicating movement cost and whether a spot will provide zero, half or full cover. Your view is fixed, though, and this lead to some costly mistakes when it’s not entirely clear where a movement choice will leave your character. For the most part, it works just fine.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Other than movement and cover, Shadowrun Returns is defined by randomness, a fickle mistress that will both reward and punish those arrogant enough to test her wrath. There are few experiences more painful than watching a carefully calculated set of maneuvers to flank a set of enemies unravel, as the text bubble “missed” show up over and over and over. While it's easy to focus on the times fate works against you, it grants unbridled power just as often. The dice rolls happening behind-the-scenes in Shadowrun Returns feel fair, pulling off the troublesome balancing act of making the player feel equally parts frustrated and elated each turn.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">What’s less random is Shadowrun Returns’ much-maligned save system, which compounds the game backing players into a creative corner. There is no way to manually save, which usually means missions must be finished before you can safely turn the game off. The autosave system kicks in during loading screens, which means some multi-level missions get you off the hook. It makes sense for Shadowrun Returns to ditch players’ ability to save and load freely, as it could eliminate any sense of consequence during combat. It’s sound logic, as I’m the kind of person who freely exploited loading to avoid permanence in XCOM. This leads to some unintended consequences during unexpected difficulty spikes, bad rolls that turns an ordinary combat sequence into a shit show, or life forcing you off the computer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Here’s a good example. Money (nuyen) is tight in Shadowrun Returns, and every purchase is important. Hiring a squad is expensive, and for just about every mission requiring one, someone gives you money upfront to make it possible. One of the game’s previous few side missions skips that step, leading me to believe I could get along with only me and another shadowrunner. That was mostly true, but the final encounter, which kicks off after 30 minutes of otherwise ordinary firefights, is much, much harder. I was pummeled after a few dice rolls went in the enemy’s favor, and it was back to the start of the level. With some creative thinking (read: running away and regrouping), I was able to complete the mission, but having to crawl through 30 minutes of battles several times over was enough to make me consider giving up on the game entirely. A save system with strict restrictions in place would have encouraged players to take risks with the gameplay systems. As it stands, saving is an wholly unnecessary hurdle to immersion.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2525720-srr_screen03_crimescene.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2525720\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2525720-srr_screen03_crimescene.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2525720\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2525720-srr_screen03_crimescene.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Though technically simple, Shadowrun Returns is a looker, with a subdued atmosphere driven by terrific artwork.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Once you learn to begrudgingly live with the save system and get up to speed with the various classes, you begin to sigh, realizing the campaign is beginning to near its climax. When it all comes together in Shadowrun Returns, it's satisfying to watch the narrative sync up right alongside your understanding of how the game works.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There are, if you click around enough, a few ways to extend the journey. Some side missions exist in Shadowrun Returns, but the game is a largely linear affair.

Unlike those grimly onerous games, Brothers operates with a beautifully spare efficiency in every aspect of its narrative and design, propelling you through a striking storybook landscape in which gameplay mechanics and thematic storytelling thread together more tightly than most games can manage. The resulting journey is so singularly devoted to creating a specific tone and atmosphere that you won't likely be able to stop thinking about it until long after you've seen it through to the end.</p><p style=\"\">The simple premise has two brothers traipsing across a brilliant fantasy world seeking a mystical cure for their ailing father. The characters speak in a made-up language, allowing the game to paint its emotional hues with a broad brush. That makes it easy to get caught up in the nuances of the individual personalities; the younger brother was present for the drowning of his mother, for instance, so naturally he's afraid of swimming himself and relies on his older brother for help. But his size comes in handy in places only he is small enough to fit. The moment-to-moment journey revolves around the ways these two use their relative strengths to support the other through each of the obstacles their quest subjects them to.</p><p style=\"\">It's the game's uniquely simple control scheme that makes you fully appreciate how much the two characters rely on each other while navigating the harsh landscape in front of them. You move each brother with one of the analog sticks, and perform a single context-sensitive action with the respective trigger. Brothers is a puzzle-driven adventure game, if you want to pigeonhole it, but this isn't a game about brainteasers. The solutions to any given scenario are usually pretty obvious; the challenge comes in managing two distinct characters at the same time. You might find your hands refusing to obey your brain on occasion, but even then, this isn't a difficult game to make your way through. Rather than challenge your manual dexterity or puzzle-solving abilities, it's a game that asks you to focus on the emotional context of the actions you're performing, and you won't be able to play for long without doing exactly that.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80590/2446916-brothers01_05_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2446916\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.58823529411765\" data-width=\"850\" style=\"width: 850px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80590/2446916-brothers01_05_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2446916\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/80590/2446916-brothers01_05_big.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\"> <div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Though the core of Brothers is its character-driven story, the game would have lingered in my mind for no other reason than the incredible design of its world. You start your journey in a sleepy seaside village, but before you end your quest you'll have encountered numerous, fantastically imagined landscapes and characters plucked from all sorts of classic mythology. And you never linger in one place too long; the game moves you so expeditiously from one location to the next, showing you so many marvelous sights, that it assumes a dreamy, fairytale quality. There's an incredible mastery of distance, scale, and perspective in the way the environments are built and framed; though it naturally looks better on a PC, it's also one of the best-looking games I can remember on consoles as well and performs perfectly fine on those machines too. For a \"small\" downloadable game, it's stunningly impressive.</p><p style=\"\">(It's tempting to rattle off a dozen specific examples of memorable moments in this game, but this feels like one of those rare games where the less you know about it, the better a time you'll have. Discovering each new environment, and all the imagination and detail contained within, is one of chief joys of playing it.)</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80590/2446897-3427236114-broth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2446897\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.58823529411765\" data-width=\"850\" style=\"width: 850px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80590/2446897-3427236114-broth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2446897\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80590/2446897-3427236114-broth.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80590/2446897-3427236114-broth.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The world is so rich, it's tempting to sit down and just gaze at it from time to time.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Given the economy of its pacing and storytelling, Brothers is another of what I've come to think of as single-sitting games. Similar to short, emotionally charged experiences like <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/journey/3030-31772/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31772\">Journey</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gone-home/3030-38327/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38327\">Gone Home</a>, Brothers isn't especially long but packs such meaning and quality into each scene that it never feels like it's wasting or padding out a single minute. Like those other games, it's designed to follow a specific narrative trajectory, and build up a certain emotional pitch, such that you'd get the most out of it by absorbing it holistically from start to finish. And this is coming from someone who never, ever marathons their way through video games.</p><p style=\"\">Brothers isn't necessarily an uplifting game; to compare it to a fairytale is to evoke the original meaning of that term, the one designed to scare small children. Some grim things occur in the course of the brothers' quest. But the brothers' commitment to their goal and to each other is so strong, the various parts of this game so superbly crafted and woven together, that it's hard not to feel deeply touched when you finally reach the end of the road and see how deftly this game marries its gameplay to its themes in a way few have before. If you're the sort of person who thinks video games are capable of not just entertaining us but also making us think and feel, you owe it to yourself to play Brothers.</p>", "deck": "Starbreeze's fairytale adventure is so finely crafted, you'd be hard pressed to find many better games this year.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-589/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store, PlayStation Network (PS3), PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39854/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons/3030-39854/", "id": 39854, "name": "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2013-09-19 16:15:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-128595/", "id": 128595, "name": "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/gone-home-review/1900-591/", "description": "<p style=\"\"> </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Have you ever walked by an empty house, and thought about going inside?

Do know that Gone Home has lived up to sky-high expectations for the next project from the creative team that delivered the exceptional <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/minervas-den/3035-3357/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3357\">Minerva's Den</a> add-on for<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/bioshock-2/3030-20827/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20827\"> BioShock 2</a>. For anyone that’s curious to know more about what makes Gone Home work so darn well, keep on reading.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Gone Home is set in 1995, and opens with the arrival of Kaitlin Greenbriar. That’s you. Returning from a whirlwind trip through Europe in the dead of night, Kaitlin approaches the front steps of her house during the height of a crackling thunderstorm, greeted by a hastily hand-written note from her younger sister, Sam. The note instructs Kaitlin that she’s gone and not to worry, which, of course, is every reason to worry. What happened here? Gone Home is played from a first-person-perspective, and there is no combat. This is a game about exploration, though one not without its share of tension. But you will never pick up a gun, and your primary means of interacting with the world is opening doors, shuffling papers, and closely examining nooks and crannies of your family's house. If you think you can touch it and interact with it, chances are The Fullbright Company will give you the option to.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Though Kaitlin’s family lives in this house, everything is unfamiliar. There’s a map that fills in as you progress through the house, appropriately labeled as it becomes clear what each room’s function is. The Fullbright Company has meticulous hidden letters, books, notes, magazines, manuscripts, inscriptions, cassette tapes, labeled recordings of <em>X-Files</em> episodes, and countless other objects throughout the house. Hidden is the wrong word, though. If someone was tasked with combing through your home and building a narrative from what was inside, it might feel like some of your stuff was hidden, too. Instead, this place feels incredibly natural. It looks...like a home. It’s messy, there are boxes everywhere, and Kaitlin’s mom was probably upset about the lack of help. There are no objects fluttering with gold dazzles to signify their importance. It is absolutely possible to miss key bits of information, but if you never knew they existed, how important were they? The story you tell in your head is only as real as the the information in front of you. Do missing pieces matter, then?</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">By god, though, is it fun to look at the pieces. They are <em>everywhere</em>, and each colored with immaculate detail. Fans of the high-resolution image genre will fall over themselves looking through the meticulously detailed pieces of history The Fullbright Company has constructed. The few times where images aren't detailed enough to read the tiniest bits of text are disappointing, but only because nearly every other spot in the house has been given such close attention. Heck, there are even physics associated with some of the objects. Cassette tape holders open, flip around, and reveal secret messages to those clever enough to manipulate them in the right way. And for those who are worried about causing a mess, the game even includes the ability to place things exactly as they were. It's the kind of touch that speaks volumes about the game's design values.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There is a path through the game, but how long you spend on that path is mostly up to you. There is very little preventing the player from barreling through the main storyline, though you’ll have to slow down to discover triggers that signal how to access locked parts of the house. These bits are deliberately easy to find, and are often closely connected to a series of voice overs by Sam, talking as though she is right next to you. (Sam is voiced by Portland voice actor Sarah Grayson, and she does excellent work here.) If anything, what’s difficult is convincing yourself to move to the next room. Patience is rewarded in Gone Home, as patience will help you discover the answers to all of your questions. Everything you want to know can be found within the house, though the game will not connect the dots for you. There is no plot summary, and material is sometimes presented out of order. This makes exploring the house, even after the story ends, continually satisfying.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Without spoiling, this all makes Gone Home sounds much more mysterious than it actually is. Still, it’s impossible to explore the house without cringing as a door creaks opens, or you start walking into the basement. Thunder and lightning strike without notice, making their appearance all the more startling, but it’s not timed to the flickering of lights or an eerie noise down the hall. There are no jump scares in Gone Home, and there are no ghosts hiding in a closet. But all the same, Gone Home feels exceedingly creepy, and the game thoughtfully plays with the differences between its dramatic presentation and the actions actually playing out on the screen. I mean, when you’re alone at home and it’s time to turn off the lights, it’s easy to tell yourself there’s nothing following you around the house, but once that idea pops into your head, it’s hard to let go.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2525698-gonehome_gigflyer.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2525698\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2525698-gonehome_gigflyer.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2525698\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2525698-gonehome_gigflyer.png\"></a><figcaption>Not everything in Gone Home is there for a reason. Much of it is there to color the world, and provide a sense of time and place.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The experience of playing Gone Home becomes more impressive upon reflection. We’re used to games hitting us over the head with big plot twists and character moments. Games are often the opposite of subtle out of fear the audience will not understand the magnitude of the moment. “We wrote this story, and this big thing happened, you see, and you better get it!.” As the layers are removed from Gone Home’s story, there is no suite of violins to underscore the revelations, and no characters to remind us what we just read or heard. (<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/chris-remo/3040-98002/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-98002\">Chris Remo</a>'s soundtrack is, however, hauntingly beautiful.) Gone Home places an impressive amount of faith into the player to discover what The Fullbright Company has laid out before them, and seems willing to lose players who aren’t going to put in the effort to come along. There is, for lack of a better phrase, a “holy shit” moment early on in the game, and it acts as though nothing's happened. The house is still there, you’re still alone, and it's time to move on.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Prepare for a nostalgia hit, too, and not just '90s references. Gone Home will remind you what it’s like to be young, naive, and full of passion. Everything mattered and nothing mattered. No one understands you and no one ever will. The world is both infinite and unfathomably small. As the story unfolds, what’s remarkable is just how unremarkable it really is. Gone Home is an epic story, but its definition of epic is far removed from how we usually talk about scope and drama in games. It’s epic, personal and revelatory to the people involved, and that’s why it’s so special. The moments in my life that I cherish the most--my first love, realizing my brother was my best friend, moving to San Francisco, getting married--would not register against saving the universe from an alien threat, but these are the epic moments in <em>my</em> life. Gone Home grounds itself by reveling in life’s quiet, defining moments, the ones you might write down in a diary, underneath a set of books, only to find years later.</p><p style=\"\">What a crazy kid you were.</p>", "deck": "This house has a story to tell, and players patient enough to listen will be rewarded with a touching story that won't soon leave you.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-591/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38327/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/gone-home/3030-38327/", "id": 38327, "name": "Gone Home"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2013-08-15 11:05:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-128973/", "id": 128973, "name": "Gone Home (Steam)"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/saints-row-iv-pc-review/1900-592/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/saints-row-iv/3030-36884/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36884\">Saints Row IV</a> builds off of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/saints-row-the-third/3030-25725/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25725\">Saints Row: The Third</a>'s successful break from the open-world crime game norm in plenty of successful ways by giving you new abilities and options set in an increasingly ridiculous world that gets wrapped around some solid, funny writing.

On the small side, a more-focused track through the game's side missions makes it more enjoyable to see and do everything the game has to offer. On the large side, the developers at Volition effectively created \"Lewd <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/crackdown/3030-4065/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4065\">Crackdown</a>\" by imbuing your cyber-President with the ability to leap over buildings, glide around the city, and collect hundreds and hundreds of orbs.

Oh, and then there's an alien invasion courtesy of the Zin, your main enemy for the bulk of the game. The alien leader, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/zinyak/3005-27202/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-27202\">Zinyak</a>, tosses you and your crew in a <em>Matrix</em>-like computer simulation of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/steelport/3035-3602/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3602\">Steelport</a>, the same city from the previous game. Since real-world rules don't apply in this oppressive simulation, things quickly spiral out until you can run faster than cars, jump higher than buildings, and shoot freeze blasts out of your fists. This, as you might expect, changes everything.</p><p style=\"\">The developers' willingness to utterly deprecate major parts of the previous game is really interesting. Why would you ever drive or upgrade a car once you can run faster than the game's fastest vehicles? Grenades and other thrown weapons are completely replaced by a trio of super abilities and the weapon tree gets blown out with guns that shoot black holes, alien rockets, or the healing--sorry, <i>destructive</i>--power of dubstep. It makes a game that was already pretty goofy even goofier. And throwing the vast majority of the game into a \"dark\" simulated version of the city of Saints Row: The Third makes the whole thing feel like some elaborate expansion or mod, rather than a full-fledged sequel. Obviously, that has good and bad baggage associated with it. Returning to the city makes for interesting story setups and remembrances of the previous game, but even if you're gliding over all of it and ignoring most of its structure, it occasionally doesn't feel like something that stands on its own.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2529049-screen+shot+2013-08-13+at+5.40.19+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2529049\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56293979671618\" data-width=\"1279\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2529049-screen+shot+2013-08-13+at+5.40.19+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2529049\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2529049-screen+shot+2013-08-13+at+5.40.19+pm.png\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Actually, the story leans pretty heavily on your knowledge of Saints Row: The Third, to the point where I'd probably recommend playing that game first if you haven't already. Crazily enough, it also throws back to the first two games in some key ways, but missing these references won't leave you struggling too much--also those games are a lot harder to go back to at this point. The story goes in some interesting directions by occasionally focusing more on the characters around you and giving you some insight into their past and present motivations. These missions are the best part about Saints Row IV, and in many cases, they give the characters more depth than you'd expect from what might otherwise look like one 17-hour <i>Matrix</i>-meets-<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mass-effect/3025-560/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-560\">Mass-Effect</a> gag. Unfortunately, a few opportunities for character building are really squandered, leaving all the interactions with one highly anticipated return character feeling completely flat.</p><p style=\"\">That 17-hour number isn't something I just pulled out of the air, by the way. That's about how long it took me to complete Saints Row IV, including all of the side missions (most of which with silver or gold medals) and with copious amounts of time devoted to collecting well over a thousand of the clusters. The game is shorter, but in a way that comes off as more focused. The side missions are offered up to you in batches, so if you like, you can let the game guide you from one task to the next, with a bonus item or buff waiting for each group you complete. Or you can run around as before and just complete the tasks as you find them, and the game will adjust accordingly and not force you to complete the missions twice. It's a smart adjustment that makes the tasks far more manageable while giving you meaningful rewards for your efforts.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Visually, Saints Row IV has the capacity to look better than the previous game. The moodier lighting of the simulation and the way the walls occasionally swim as the simulation's textures animate across the sides of buildings is a nice effect, and things even look nice when you're flying high above the city. But from a tech perspective, it's mostly on-par with Saints Row 3. The characters models are roughly identical, the weapon effects are often similar, and so on. It's not a huge leap forward, even if the game's engine is better at serving up its polygons and textures at high speeds. Also, I can only say this about the PC version of the game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2529050-screen+shot+2013-08-13+at+5.45.24+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2529050\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2529050-screen+shot+2013-08-13+at+5.45.24+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2529050\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2529050-screen+shot+2013-08-13+at+5.45.24+pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2529050-screen+shot+2013-08-13+at+5.45.24+pm.png\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Not to sound elitist, but going from the PC version of Saints Row IV to the Xbox 360 version of the game was enough to make me think that they maybe shouldn't have released this game on consoles. The frame rate of Saints Row: The Third wasn't pretty on consoles, and the bigger ask related to your character's speed and mobility make this game run even worse. The frame rate is rarely acceptable and on top of that, the game likes to hitch up completely for a bit when it autosaves. Making precision landings and lining up headshots is more difficult with its rotten frame rate, and the game is, overall, less fun on the Xbox 360 than it is on a proper PC as a result.</p><p style=\"\">That said, I enjoyed it a great deal, and parts of this game almost feel like they've been specifically tailored to my interests. I mean, Riff Raff hosts one of the radio stations. That's a great choice. The game is packed with some great moments that subvert the open-world crime genre even further than SR3 did, it's funny, and its references aren't just lazily tossed off, they're earned.

Those years of nonexistence haven't led to some radical shift in style, mechanics, or even progression, mind you. Instead, the time spent crafting Pikmin 3 for <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>'s <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> console has resulted in a game that feels almost exactly like what a modern <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pikmin/3025-439/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-439\">Pikmin</a> game ought to feel like. It takes elements from both its predecessors, tweaks some concepts and ideas, adds a few new flavors of Pikmin, and boosts the visual fidelity to expected degrees of quality.

Pikmin 3 takes place some time after the previous games, and instead tells the tales of three new explorers named Alph, Brittany, and Charlie, who have come to the Pikmin homeworld in search of a new food source for their ailing planet. Expectedly, they crash land and end up separated, but as the game rolls along, you'll eventually reunite them and end up controlling each of the crew members in concert.</p><p style=\"\">And you'll control those adorably, vacantly helpful Pikmin too. Initially, you'll have just a few at your disposal, but it won't be long before you're commanding large swarms to break down walls, attack killer creatures, and haul both their carcasses and other found objects back to your ship for absorption/study. The main objects you'll be looking for are various fruits, the object of your mission and also your key to survival. Pikmin 3 is broken out into different days, and at the end of each day, you and your Pikmin must retreat back to your landing site to avoid any nocturnal predators. Any Pikmin left straggling behind are mercilessly devoured by the aforementioned predators, and if you fail to grab fruit, you'll start draining your ship's stores of sustenance. A jar's worth of juice is used each day, so collecting fruit to distill into drinkable stores is vital to your survival.</p><p style=\"\">This is one of the better ways that Pikmin 3 strikes a balance between the designs of the previous games. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pikmin/3030-2405/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2405\">Pikmin</a> had that hard-stop limit of 30 days to gather all your ship parts and escape the planet, while <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pikmin-2/3030-2480/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2480\">Pikmin 2</a> went fully in the other direction, creating a somewhat breezy, if occasionally listless experience. Here you have as many days as you need to complete your journey, but each day blows by at an occasionally startling clip, and running out of juice is a concern you must be mindful of.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Odds are you won't run out of Pikmin, so long as you don't simply toss them to the slaughter on a regular basis. Plus, there are myriad types of Pikmin to \"collect,\" if that's the right word. Previous subspecies, like the red, yellow, and blue varieties, are joined by rock Pikmin (whose hard outer shells make them ideal for cracking particularly tough surfaces), and pink flying Pikmin, which don't enter until far later in the game, but have the delightful distinction of being able to simply fly past most major obstacles (though definitely not all). There are white and purple varieties, too, though they're relegated to the game's offline only multiplayer mode.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2496909-ss15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2496909\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56234718826406\" data-width=\"818\" style=\"width: 818px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2496909-ss15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2496909\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2496909-ss15.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Going into Pikmin 3, I had no particular desire for multiplayer. But that bingo battle mode won me over pretty quick.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That multiplayer mode, incidentally, is also a pretty solid addition. The mission mode (which features short maps with specific objectives, and can also be played solo) is decent enough, but really the bingo battle mode is what sells it. Here, each player is given a specific \"bingo card\" that includes particular enemies and fruit types that have to be brought back to each player's home base. Though the fact that it's only a splitscreen mode limits its appeal a bit, this is one of those modes that's exciting enough to make it absolutely worth dragging a friend over for.</p><p style=\"\">If Pikmin 3 has any particularly noteworthy flaw, it's that it doesn't offer up a single control scheme that comes without caveat. Presumably, most players are expected to use the GamePad to control things, which certainly has its advantages. The GamePad screen acts as a map, for instance, which is incredibly useful as you go back to explore environments and look for any areas you might have missed. It also features camera control via the right stick, which allows you to keep from getting boxed in by large enemies (except in the rare instances where the game just decides you don't get to have camera control). The one thing it doesn't do very well is allow you to round up Pikmin quickly and efficiently. That's something the Wii Remote control scheme does much better, though that obviously lacks both the advantages of the GamePad.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2484307-screenshot_55584.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2484307\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2484307-screenshot_55584.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2484307\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2484307-screenshot_55584.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2484307-screenshot_55584.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The world of Pikmin 3 is lush, vibrantly colored, and adorably designed.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In either situation, Pikmin 3 mostly handles admirably. I found myself running into some issues with boss fights early on, mostly as I tried to keep my Pikmin together and maintain target locks on the enemy, which can be more of a chore than it ought to be. To be fair, boss battles have never been my favorite part of Pikmin, and while the ones offered up in Pikmin 3 are generally well-designed, they didn't change my mind on the subject, either. I prefer the more leisurely parts of the game. I like taking in the colorful, sumptuously realized visuals, tackling the Pikmin-oriented world puzzles, and collecting thing after thing. All of these aspects of Pikmin 3 are well done, to the point where I found myself easily getting lost in the campaign, while not actually getting<em> lost</em> trying to navigate the campaign, if you know what I mean.</p><p style=\"\">For these reasons, Pikmin 3 is an easy recommendation for any Wii U owner, and not just for lack of available games as of this writing. Even with a stronger library of competing titles, Pikmin 3 would stand out due to the sheer craft and attention to detail paid to each aspect of its design. Yes, it's most certainly \"just\" more of the Pikmin we came to know during the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a> era, but after nine years on the shelf, coming back to a Pikmin game this solidly designed quickly reminded me why I had such affection for this series in the first place.</p>", "deck": "Pikmin 3 might just be the most pleasingly balanced entry in the franchise yet.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-593/", "platforms": "Wii U", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27930/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pikmin-3/3030-27930/", "id": 27930, "name": "Pikmin 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-08-14 12:30:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-126924/", "id": 126924, "name": "Pikmin 3"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-bureau-xcom-declassified-review/1900-594/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/3030-30813/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30813\">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</a> never quite presents a clear vision of what it wants to be. That might seem like an easy criticism to lob at a game that's spent numerous years in development under different directions and genres, but the final product's issues seem less the result of a team harried by constant delays, and more the result of an underlying concept too outsized for its own good.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2483649-2kg_thebureauxd_cartersquad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483649\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56197916666667\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2483649-2kg_thebureauxd_cartersquad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483649\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2483649-2kg_thebureauxd_cartersquad.jpg\"></a><figcaption>As William Carter, you are our last line of defense against the alien threat. Well, you and the two guys you constantly order around.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The simple logline for The Bureau is that it wants to tell the story of the earliest days of XCOM, the world's united force against alien invaders most recently resurrected in <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/firaxis-games/3010-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-361\">Firaxis</a>' excellent strategy game <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xcom-enemy-unknown/3030-37152/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37152\">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a>. Whereas that game took place in a sort of near future vision of Earth, The Bureau goes back to the 1960s, when the alien visitors first came looking for trouble. Throughout the game, you play as Agent William Carter, a gruff, no-nonsense ex-CIA operative who finds himself in the middle of a burgeoning war between our planet and extraterrestrial forces almost entirely by accident. After surviving an initial assault, you're recruited into XCOM and given a team of agents to command.</p><p style=\"\">This is the aspect of The Bureau that most closely resembles the strategy games of old. Eschewing the turn-based methodology of the other games, here you'll be in real-time combat as you command your duo of agents around the battlefields of America. Simple commands like moving agents into cover or picking specific targets for them to focus on eventually give way to more intriguing abilities. Your agents, depending on what class they work under, can launch gun and missile turrets, lay down mines, knock back enemies with pulse weapons, develop one-shot kill abilities, and even call down airstrikes. Meanwhile, you have your own set of alien technology-culled abilities, which range from simple lifts of enemies out of cover, to straight up mind-controlling enemy combatants.</p><p style=\"\">This is also the part of The Bureau that works the best. The sheer variety of abilities at your disposal ensures that combat sequences are hectic, but almost never overly confusing. Only a game-ending battle between an overabundance of enemies really tests the nerves. The rest of the time, you'll be out on various missions, either story-focused or side ventures. Most of these are pretty breezy, though cranking the difficulty up will certainly enrich the challenge. You'll need to be on the higher settings if you really want the game's version of the XCOM permadeath system to mean anything anyway. On all settings but the highest, I rarely had any issue keeping my agents alive and well-stocked between missions, which made me wonder why the system was even there in the first place.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2483648-2kg_thebureauxd_battlefocus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483648\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56256572029443\" data-width=\"1902\" style=\"width: 1902px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2483648-2kg_thebureauxd_battlefocus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483648\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2483648-2kg_thebureauxd_battlefocus.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Issuing commands to your squad is quick and easy, and the variety of abilities you have at your disposal keeps the combat relatively fresh from encounter to encounter.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The only real issue with the combat is that the game's level designs rarely allow for much surprise. If you find yourself in a big open area with lots of cover points, odds are you're about to find yourself in a fight. If you're just about anywhere else, you might find one or two scattered enemies floating about, but nothing you really need any tactics for. One of the tenets of the XCOM series is its pervasive sense of dread, the notion that a team-destroying threat could be awaiting you at just about any turn. The Bureau has almost none of that, focusing instead on its deeply silly sci-fi storyline to keep you engaged between bouts of shooting whatever happens to be alive and in your field of vision.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">About that storyline: While the idea of exploring the roots of the XCOM division is a nifty one, The Bureau handles this exceptionally poorly almost right from the beginning. One problem is the game's sense of scope. It goes straight for the apocalyptic jugular right from the start, meaning there's no real room to explore, get to know the characters you're working with, or really understand what the hell is going on until the game gets around to info dumping a bunch of exceedingly dumb junk on you toward the end. It's hard to explain the endgame of The Bureau without just spoiling it, but suffice it to say it pulls from a gaggle of well-worn sci-fi cliches, and uses them all rather poorly.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame, because The Bureau captures the atmosphere of its setting rather well. The game crafts a nice balance between its early '60s time period and the invasive alien technology surrounding it, and a solid cast of voice actors do a decent job of keeping you interested, even as the script devolves into absolute nonsense. There's a great soundtrack too, mixing a period-appropriate score with a few pop hits from the era.</p><p style=\"\">But that atmosphere is all but wasted by the jumps in logic, bizarre character decisions, and plot holes the size of an alien mothership. The script constantly tries to talk its way out of ludicrous situations, but never does so in a way that feels satisfactory or even halfway sensible. Even when you think the game is finally wrapping itself up, it keeps finding ways to keep the adventure going, falling deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole of inexplicable nonsense that it doesn't really even bother to try and climb its way out of.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2483653-2kg_thebureauxd_squadrevive.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483653\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56197916666667\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2483653-2kg_thebureauxd_squadrevive.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483653\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2483653-2kg_thebureauxd_squadrevive.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2483653-2kg_thebureauxd_squadrevive.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>In theory, keeping your agents alive is crucial, though on most difficulty settings, I didn't have much trouble keeping them around.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game's various tech issues don't help much either.

Animation glitches (especially from downed enemies, who have some real issues due to the ragdoll physics employed), audio hiccups, and even the occasional seemingly missing cutscene reared their head as well. If I had to pick a favored version, I suppose it would be the 360 one. The PC version generally had a very hard time running on a PC I usually have no problems with.</p><p style=\"\">Somewhere, buried underneath years of reworked development, scrapped and revamped ideas, and a whole host of problems, is a version of The Bureau worth getting excited about. Maybe if it had scaled back the scope of its <em>X-Files-</em>meets-the era of <em>Mad Men</em> concept, focusing on the earliest incursions of the massive conflict brought to bear in Enemy Unknown, it might have helped rein in some of the crazier, stupider, and more aggressively junky portions of the game. As is, The Bureau makes for a decent enough 10 hours of alien-obliterating combat, but all the way through you'll find yourself lamenting the many aspects that feel like they could have, and should have, been better.</p>", "deck": "An entertaining combat system props up this otherwise clunky, harebrained sci-fi action game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-594/", "platforms": "PC, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30813/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/3030-30813/", "id": 30813, "name": "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-08-23 12:41:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-98826/", "id": 98826, "name": "The Bureau: XCOM Declassified"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review/1900-595/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/madden-nfl/3025-491/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-491\">Madden NFL</a> is now a 25-year-old franchise.

This likely being the last meaningful installment of the franchise on this generation of hardware, it's not altogether surprising that the developers at <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ea-sports/3010-6255/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6255\">EA Sports</a> wouldn't completely revamp the game yet again as resources begin drifting toward new consoles. But for a game that aims to celebrate Madden's storied history and its various innovations over the years, 25 feels oddly sterile, slapdash, and generally unremarkable.</p><p style=\"\">The noteworthy changes to the gameplay this year are few and far between. When running the ball, an additional modifier has been added that lets you do more powerful versions of the jukes, trucks, and spin moves inherent to the ball carrier. They aren't exactly different moves so much as just more effective versions of the same moves you already have. All you have to do is hold down a trigger button and use the same stick movements/button presses you normally would, and now that stiff arm is stiffer, that juke jukier, and so on.</p><p style=\"\">Maybe this is a meaningful addition to players who aren't good at pulling off the existing ball carrier maneuvers, but if you've been playing Madden at all in the last few years, the trigger pull is just one more step to add to the typical array of moves you're already accustomed to. The running game as it is already skews heavily in favor of the offense. Even with middling backs from pass-crazy teams, I was pretty regularly able to rip off large chunks of yardage in any situation outside of an obvious stacking of the line by the defense. The passing game is pretty breezy as well, with receivers regularly creating crazy amounts of separation and blowing past corners on deep routes in ways I don't recall being quite as prevalent last year. Granted, interceptions tended to pop up a lot more than they do this year, so that might be part of it.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495640-madden25-screen-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495640\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495640-madden25-screen-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495640\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495640-madden25-screen-12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Infinity Engine, introduced last year for physics-based tackles and hits, has seen some improvement this year. Still, you'll find more than your share of odd-looking animations.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Madden's defensive AI has had its share of problems over the years, certainly, and I'm not saying Madden NFL 25 is that much worse than any of the last few entries. Still, in this year's game, it often feels like defensive plays are more often the result of shoddy blocking than any actual useful defensive strategy. Receivers and tight ends have gotten arguably lousier about taking down linebackers and DBs on run plays, and the offensive line has a real bad tendency to bunch up in idiotic ways that leave delayed blitzers wide open to obliterate the QB if you're not insanely quick on your feet. A little of this stuff certainly makes sense in the context of the real life game, but here I kept running into these mistakes and miscues with almost absurd regularity.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">As with all major simulation sports games, there are numerous settings and sliders one can adjust to fix some of these problems. And in the one single, solitary great new addition to Madden NFL 25, now you can download other people's settings too. Community creations, including slider settings, playbooks, and roster updates, can be easily downloaded from a menu within the game. Though the day-of-release group of content isn't necessarily easy to sift through, a ratings system included should help the best stuff float to the top eventually.</p><p style=\"\">There's not much difference in how the game is presented on the field, compared with last year. Player models are as bulbous and stiffly animated as ever, though at least the physics-based tackling animations--introduced last year with the addition of the Infinity Engine--result in a few less insane looking non-injuries on the field, and a lot less random pratfalls by players who, last year, couldn't help tripping over any nearby downed player on the field. Commentary from Jim Nantz and Phil Simms returns, though repeated lines, inconsistent dialogue (Simms chiding a team for throwing a short pass that yielded a first down, then complimenting another short pass that only gained two yards a play later, for example), and occasional straight-up miscalls are frequent and annoying.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2535877-madden-25-owner-mode-9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2535877\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56181818181818\" data-width=\"550\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2535877-madden-25-owner-mode-9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2535877\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2535877-madden-25-owner-mode-9.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2535877-madden-25-owner-mode-9.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The return of owner mode would be a lot more exciting if the process of managing your team didn't feel like such a slog.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While all these issues don't necessarily conspire to ruin the game of digital football, they're disappointing, and emblematic of the larger problem this game suffers from. Namely, a total lack of a single, standout feature to point to in order to say, \"Yes, this game deserves to be purchased if you already own last year's game.\"</p><p style=\"\">Not even the new version of the connected careers mode, Madden 13's big revamp of franchise and superstar mode into one glob of simulated NFL management, makes such a case. Yes, a few things have been improved or added here and there. For one thing, owner mode returns, allowing you to create your own megalomaniacal billionaire to head up any of the league's 32 teams. The usual owner junk, like setting merchandise and ticket prices, is joined by the ability to move your team to one of several different cities, and rebrand them using preset logos and names. Elsewhere, players taking control of coaches and superstars can run through the usual paces, albeit with the returned inclusion of fantasy draft, for those who bemoaned its exclusion last year (myself included).</p><p style=\"\">The problem is, the bigger issues with the mode--namely, its ungainly user interface and sometimes busted logic when it comes to things like signing and drafting players--remain just as problematic this time around. The free agent menu is a bit better now, but players are still highly capricious when deciding whether to go with your team or pick another offer, and usable information on your team needs isn't as immediately available as it should be when you're in the signing period. This is one of those cases where a total overhaul of the mode's menu systems is likely needed, as the navigation systems are just too unwieldy for the number of things you're theoretically supposed to keep track of, and constantly delegating tasks to the CPU just because trying to get around the menus is a pain in the ass is no fun at all.</p><p style=\"\">On a side note, it's worth mentioning that this is the first <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PS3</a> version I've played of the game in a while. Typically EA sends us <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> code for review, and in playing the PS3 version, I found the in-game menus to be extremely laggy, even when compared with last year's game on the 360. Is this something PS3 owners have been enduring for a while? Or a recent issue? Either way, the sheer sluggishness of the menu navigation in this PS3 version is pretty brutal. I also ran into my share of crashes and minor bugs, though I don't know if those are platform specific or not.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2535879-madden-share-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2535879\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56307692307692\" data-width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2535879-madden-share-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2535879\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2535879-madden-share-5.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2535879-madden-share-5.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>So it's definitely telling that the most exciting feature of Madden 25 is the ability to download community created files that aim to fix the game, right? </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Other modes, like Ultimate Team and the skills challenges, are generally better served. Ultimate Team still runs on the card-trading system EA's been using for years, but now there's a more useful structure to the mode that lets you compete against both AI and online teams to both unlock new cards and improve your team's chemistry. Completing skills challenges also provides unlocks, while serving as a decent tutorial for some of the game's new control systems. Online play isn't really any different than what you'd expect. You can still do the online version of the connected careers mode with multiple friends, and online matches still vary pretty wildly in terms of lag and playability. For what it's worth, when I did get into a match against a nearby opponent, the game seemed to be perfectly responsive, outside of a few weird physics glitches now and again.</p><p style=\"\">Presenting Madden NFL 25 as a big, celebratory anniversary makes a degree of sense, given the rarity of such significant anniversaries in video game franchises. But having this game serve as that celebration maybe wasn't the best move. It's clear that EA is already prepping itself to go full bore into the next generation of systems, and that Madden NFL 25 is little more than a stopgap solution to plop into that August spot where Madden games are predestined to go. This is most certainly a functional, fully-featured game of football. But if you already own <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/madden-nfl-13/3030-37754/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37754\">Madden NFL 13</a>, think long and hard about how badly you really want to set concession prices, and download user-made rosters and settings, because there's little else of note here to suggest that Madden NFL 25 warrants yet another $60 of your money.</p>", "deck": "Madden's silver anniversary offers little notable forward progress for the series.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-595/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41459/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/madden-nfl-25/3030-41459/", "id": 41459, "name": "Madden NFL 25"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-08-27 13:15:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127917/", "id": 127917, "name": "Madden NFL 25"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rayman-legends-review/1900-596/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Not enough people played <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rayman-origins/3030-31721/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31721\">Rayman Origins</a>. I mean, yeah, lots of people played it, but it's honestly one of those games that I think just about <em>everyone</em> should play. Its deft mixture of challenging platforming gameplay, gorgeous artwork, and a silly sensibility combined to form one of the most genuinely pleasing games of the last several years. Maybe more people will play its newly released sequel, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rayman-legends/3030-38141/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38141\">Rayman Legends</a>.

Teensies (little blue people with humongous noses) are being kidnapped, and it's up to you to rescue them as you jump, fly, swim, and dash through dozens of different levels, split across several worlds. Each world is unlocked as you collect more and more teensies in each level, which are often stashed behind secret doors or other level sections off the beaten path.</p><p style=\"\">Not that there's a great deal of room for exploration in Rayman Legends, but there doesn't really need to be, either. This is a quick-paced 2D platformer, geared toward fast, but precise traversal of all sorts of pitfalls, traps, and enemies of varying difficulty. Like Origins, Legends is a game best described as \"challenging,\" rather than \"hard.\" Early on, the game's absolutely breezy, but by the second or third world, tougher and tougher challenges await, including some tricky boss fights, and a number of specialized levels geared toward touch-screen mechanics as well as rhythmic inclination.</p><p style=\"\">First, those touch-screen levels. In these sections, control of the character on-screen is wrested away from the single player, and you instead find yourself tapping, swiping, and jabbing at the screen on either your <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> or <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">Vita</a>. You do these motions to remove traps, adjust platforms, and even distract enemies as the AI character on screen presses forward, attacking and jumping where needed. Most of the time, this works pretty well. The AI can occasionally bug out and make an idiotic jump to their death, and there are moments on both platforms where the touch-screen doesn't immediately do what you want it to. It's also worth noting that the non-touch-screen-oriented platforms (like the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3055-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1463\">PS3</a>) replace these mechanics with simple button presses on the controller.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">You can mitigate that AI issue by playing with friends (the Wii U version supports up to five players, while the other console and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> versions support four), though co-op comes with its own set of challenges--namely, the chaos of many characters occupying the tight, periodically confusing spaces of the game's levels. Still, even with that occasional chaos, Legends is a ton of fun with other players, and its easy drop-in/drop-out setup makes it a breeze for people to join.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495872-rayman-legends_2013_06-10-13_009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495872\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495872-rayman-legends_2013_06-10-13_009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495872\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495872-rayman-legends_2013_06-10-13_009.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Origins was a spectacular looking game, and Legends manages to be even more visually resplendent.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Even with occasional AI quirks, I often found the touch-screen sections quite creative and nearly as much fun as the traditional platforming levels. The pace doesn't slow down much when you're swiping and tapping versus running and jumping, and the game's solid enough with checkpoints to ensure you aren't repeating too many sections over and over. That becomes key late in the game, when the challenge really ramps up. Yes, there will be sections you play again and again that will most certainly frustrate you, but I actually found there to be less of those moments than in Origins, which redlined toward the end and didn't really let up once it got there.</p><p style=\"\">There's ample variety throughout the game, as well. In addition to those touch-screen levels, there are also musical levels, which are essentially chases set to goofy music that require the player to time all their movements to the rhythms of the song. It sounds a lot harder than it actually is. If you've got a decent ear for music, you'll probably blow through them pretty easily, even toward the end. Elsewhere, there are levels from Rayman Origins that have been remixed for the purposes of this game, a variety of unlockable challenge levels, and \"invasion\" levels, which are timed runs of remixed, completed Legends levels.</p><p style=\"\">Apparently, those invasion levels are missing from the Vita game, which is unfortunate, but not exactly a version killer. As it happens, those invasion levels are fun, but not exactly the major highlight of the game, and the Vita release is otherwise a fantastic version. Yes, Legends certainly looks best when its gorgeous 2D art is blown up on an HDTV screen, but the Vita version displays the game's art design extremely well, and has that added benefit of being entirely portable.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227899-rle3gyrospike.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227899\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2227899-rle3gyrospike.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2227899\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227899-rle3gyrospike.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2227899-rle3gyrospike.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Normally, wresting traditional control from the player in favor of touch-screen swiping is less-than-ideal, but Legends makes good use of touch-screens on the platforms that support them.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Above all else, Rayman Legends is just charming as hell. Origins was too, but Legends takes many of the best elements of Origins--its beautiful visuals, accessible controls, clever level designs, and goofily catchy music--and improves upon just about every one of them. Origins had the distinction of being one of the best-looking, best-playing 2D platformers of this generation, and Legends somehow manages to be even more masterful in its execution. This is one of those games that's so terrifically crafted, so effervescently energetic, so beautifully, colorfully drawn, that it's genuinely difficult to come up with legitimate caveats to possibly dissuade anyone from it.</p><p style=\"\">So I won't even try.

That game came out 20 years ago, mind you, and was also only EA's third attempt at even making a hockey game. In that time, the NHL franchise has seen numerous massive leaps in technology, mechanics, and overall depth, and yet people still cling to NHL '94 the way football fans pine for the days of NFL 2K, and wrestling fans continue to chase the dragon of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wwf-no-mercy/3030-11394/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11394\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wwf-no-mercy/3030-11394/\">WWF No Mercy</a>.

This year's NHL game builds upon the physics upgrades introduced last year to turn the game into a much more hard-hitting affair, one where following through with checks will often lay players flat on the ice, and where a fight always appears moments from erupting. These changes serve to turn NHL 14 into something a bit less realistically paced than last year's game, not to mention something far more aggressively violent than we've seen in a licensed hockey game since <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nhl-hitz/3025-670/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-670\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nhl-hitz/3025-670/\">NHL Hitz</a> was still something that existed. Whether or not that's up your alley will of course depend on how true-to-life you like your sports simulations.</p><p style=\"\">First, let's talk about all that checking. I quite dug <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nhl-13/3030-37807/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37807\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nhl-13/3030-37807/\">NHL 13</a>'s introduction of new player physics, and the changes made to collision detection and checking here are mostly good ones. Instead of only using a dedicated checking button/stick, players can now check opponents simply by running into them. Line up a player, charge straight into him, and chances are that you'll knock them to their knees or flat on their backs if you build up enough of a head of steam. Of course, momentum is key in this. You can't just rub up against opponents and expect them to fall down, and if you don't line up your hits just right, you'll whiff hard and probably go crashing into the boards yourself.</p><p style=\"\">Mostly, this works out just fine. Sure, checks are more frequent than in real life (playing on the \"hardcore sim\" mode with a higher difficulty level balances more in favor of reality, if that's what you want), but the hitting has a good feel to it, especially in a quickly paced game against non-AI players. If there's any problem with the system, it's that it now tends to result in a few too many unintended penalties. AI opponents have a tendency to turn into the boards any time you try to hit them while near the sides of the rink. This results in a lot of boarding penalties and other such accidents when you're just trying to check a guy from the side.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Whenever this happens, it's a good bet that the game's new fighting system will engage as a result. Fighting is one of those weird quirks of hockey games that hardly anyone has ever done well. NHL 14 doesn't buck that trend exactly, but it does offer a minor improvement. Now, when players drop the gloves, the camera remains zoomed out in the third-person view, and the two players brawling mostly spend their time grappling with one another, awkwardly throwing fists and attempting to dodge uppercuts more closely to the way enforcers in the NHL do. That's not to say that the fighting system is a great deal of fun--it definitely isn't--but at least visually speaking, it looks more like a hockey fight than most of the other things EA has tried this generation.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, one of the results of the game's new-found interest in fighting is an overabundance of defenders angling to start shit with you. Any time a player skates too close to the goalie on a frozen puck, bumps too closely to an agitated opponent, or really does anything other than skate in the opposite direction of the offensive zone after a play, you'll end up in an entanglement with an opposing player. Granted, most of these just involve guys grappling and jawing at one another, and it's rare that you see more than one or two fights in a game on the default settings. Still, there's a weird hypersensitivity here that's far more prevalent than in the real game. Sure, you'll sometimes see real life defenders get annoyed that an offensive player is jabbing at the puck after the whistle, and move in to engage. But here it happens constantly, with frequent overreaction to perceived slights that amount to basically nothing.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2544625-711378_20130715_screen003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2544625\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2544625-711378_20130715_screen003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2544625\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2544625-711378_20130715_screen003.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Celebrating NHL '94's 20th anniversary is a novel idea, but the mode included in NHL 14 doesn't quite hit the same level of excitement.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Beyond these changes, little else has shifted on the ice from last year's game, though that's mostly a good thing. Offense largely feels balanced, though your AI teammates still tend to have a real hard time figuring out how to set up plays in the offensive zone. Defense is better, in that the poke-check isn't quite as overpowered as it's been in previous years (though is still highly effective). And goalies generally seem capable of stopping most types of shots, with perhaps the sole exception of high-angle wristshots, which tended in my experience to go in far more often than any other shot type.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, gameplay wasn't really NHL 13's problem anyway. It was the feature set, the slate of modes surrounding the gameplay that failed to impress. NHL 14 fixes some of the issues from last year, but also leaves more than a few of them dangling.</p><p style=\"\">The most significant change to any one mode this year is in the Be-a-Player area. Previously a fun, but mostly dry representation of what it's like to be a player in the NHL, the mode has been rebranded as \"Live the Life,\" while skewing closer to the types of scenarios and concepts used in <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k/3025-498/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-498\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k/3025-498/\">NBA 2K</a>'s own career mode. Now when you create a superstar, you'll have to participate in interviews with prospective teams and the media, handle endorsement deals, and try to fabricate some manner of personality to go along with your on-ice avatar. It's a nice idea, but it doesn't work particularly well, due in no small part to the mode's utter lack of any uniqueness. It's like EA plucked the skeletal structure of NBA 2K's player mode, grafted it onto its existing feature set, and just hoped everyone would be excited by it. Unfortunately, it's all so blandly presented that none of it really registers, and holdover problems--like the mode's constant punishment of you simming games instead of playing them--remain prevalent. It's still fun to create your own player and take them through a career, but the changes made do little to add anything of substance to the equation.</p><p style=\"\">Other problems from last year's game are at least marginally addressed, if not entirely improved. Offline, the Be-a-GM mode is definitely better, thanks to improved trade logic and more useful indicators of what trading teams are looking for in return. Online, the GM mode is a bit easier to use this time around, but still has more than its share of arcane menus that seemingly lead you around in circles. Load times are still kind of a pain as well, though they aren't as overbearing as last year's mode, and online lag is still occasionally an issue, regardless of what mode you're playing in. Hockey Ultimate Team remains as enjoyable as ever, once again offering up numerous single-player and online play modes as you build up a squad through card collecting and trading.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2544616-711377_20130605_640screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2544616\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2544616-711377_20130605_640screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2544616\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2544616-711377_20130605_640screen005.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2544616-711377_20130605_640screen005.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Players in NHL 14 aren't afraid to drop the gloves for a brawl. If anything, they're perhaps a bit too eager by default.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Lastly, there is the NHL '94 mode. Given the 20-year anniversary, perhaps it's not surprising that EA would want to celebrate. Unfortunately, the way it chooses to celebrate is by crafting a marginally entertaining retread of NHL '94 using the current game engine and rosters. I'm not saying this mode isn't any fun at all--in fact, the simplifying of the controls back to '94 standards, and the quickened pace of the game combine into something that can periodically be quite entertaining. The issue is that it doesn't really feel all that much like NHL '94, so much as a sped-up, greatly simplified of the game you would be playing otherwise. More baffling is that the mode can only be played offline. No one will argue that NHL '94 wasn't a terrific multiplayer game back before things like online play existed, but not even having that option here is just weird, since it's not really that fun of a mode when played by one's self.</p><p style=\"\">All of this considered, NHL 14 is most certainly a better game than last year's, but whether it's enough to convince you to go for another purchase will likely depend on how badly you want improvements to the series' more physical game elements. In terms of visuals, commentary, and feature set, little of NHL 14 changes notably from what was on offer last year, leaving only the hitting and fighting systems as the marquee upgrades. NHL 13 had a pretty massive chasm between the quality of its gameplay and its feature set, and that chasm hasn't really been filled in much at all this year. If you missed out on NHL 13, NHL 14 comes recommended largely without caveat. If you did pick up 13, consider how badly you want to see improved hitting and an abundance of fighting before deciding if you need to drop another $60.</p>", "deck": "The specter of NHL '94 looms large over EA's latest hockey game, which ultimately works both to its benefit and detriment.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-597/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42387/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nhl-14/3030-42387/", "id": 42387, "name": "NHL 14"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-09-11 11:49:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127231/", "id": 127231, "name": "NHL 14"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-598/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2543893-8395671420.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543893\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2543893-8395671420.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543893\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2543893-8395671420.png\"></a><figcaption>Michael's therapist will probably have something to say about all this.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\">Grand Theft Auto</a> took a turn for the serious when it moved to the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> in 2008. In the pursuit of a world that felt more fully realized, the developers at <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rockstar-games/3010-1194/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1194\">Rockstar</a> left the free-wheeling weirdness of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\">San Andreas</a> behind. Suddenly all the random mayhem and madness of the previous entries felt somehow out of place and, though you could get into a firefight at the drop of a hat, the chaos felt less fun than it did during the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">GTA III</a> trilogy. With <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-v/3030-36765/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36765\">Grand Theft Auto V</a>, the franchise attempts to get it both ways, with another cluster of serious narrative that's told in an exciting way, but also in an occasionally more lighthearted one, as well. Sprinkle in a little bit of genuine weirdness and you've got a recipe for disaster that works in spite of itself, a well-told tale of criminals in mid-life crisis that doesn't always mesh properly with the trappings of your typical open-world crime simulator, but the individual parts are usually so good that it barely matters.</p><p style=\"\">Rather than settling on one criminal, GTAV asks you to play as three. You're introduced to these characters over the course of the game's first few hours, and each settles into his own niche. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/michael-de-santa/3005-24896/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24896\">Michael</a> is the career criminal that left the life and settled down with his wife and two kids in <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/los-santos/3035-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-19\">Los Santos</a>--the game's version of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/los-angeles/3035-490/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-490\">Los Angeles</a>--only to be bored out of his skull, resulting in a lot of sitting around, drinking, and watching old movies. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/franklin/3005-24897/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24897\">Franklin</a> is a low-level gangster that has seemingly remained unaffiliated with the city's larger gangs, but he and his lifelong friend, Lamar, seem to want to get out of the hood by stepping up into the larger-sized crimes. But for the meantime, they're working as repo men for a crooked car dealership.</p><p style=\"\">A memorable chance meeting between Michael and Franklin sets the story in motion, reconnecting Michael to the life of crime he left behind while giving him a young apprentice to school in the ways of doing dirt. It doesn't take long for the duo to raise their profile just enough to catch the attention of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/trevor-phillips/3005-24898/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24898\">Trevor</a>, Michael's old partner-in-literal-crime. Trevor is the classic \"loose cannon\" of the game, meaning he swears a lot and threatens to kill people all the time for no good reason. He also happens to be running a meth and guns operation just north of Los Santos, making it convenient for him to come into town to track down his old friend who, by the way, has been thought to be dead for the past ten years. This makes for a series of uneasy relationships, not only between the three core protagonists but also the people in their lives, be they feds of questionable integrity, methed-out desert dwellers, or Franklin's crazy aunt.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2542561-873-1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2542561\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2542561-873-1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2542561\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2542561-873-1280.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Trevor, in one of the game's more uncomfortable sequences.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Unless you're in a mission, you can typically switch to any of the three characters at will. That doesn't mean you can drop any of the three characters into any point in the game, though. Each character has his own missions and switching between them moves you to wherever that character is as you join his life, which is already in progress. This means you might catch Trevor waking up in the middle of the desert, wearing a dress. Or you might catch Michael waking up screaming. It's a good little trick that gives the illusion that these characters are off living their lives, even when you aren't directly controlling them. It also helps make each character's personal story make sense. Since Trevor is the one wrapped up in meth dealings with the Chinese, he's the one starting those missions. Franklin is the one occasionally getting wrapped up in some gangster shit. And so on. The multiple characters concept works out beautifully, giving you the feeling of \"taking a break\" from one character's drama to peek in on another's.</p><p style=\"\">The mission design is your basic Grand Theft Auto sort of stuff, for the most part. You'll drive to the start of a mission, get a cutscene, and then usually have to drive somewhere else to get things going. But some of the missions start to mix up multiple characters, like one where Trevor just happens to show up at Franklin's as he's about to go help a friend cop a brick of coke. As video game drug deals tend to go, this one goes bad, and the crew is forced to shoot their way out of a bad situation. With two of the game's three playable characters along for the ride, the game lets you swap between them on the fly. This lets you get a little tactical, but it also plays into the game's stat system and special abilities. At the outset, Trevor is a better shooter than Franklin. This only makes a big difference when you're free-aiming a <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle</a>, since the game's lock-on targeting system trivializes the game's combat to the point where you're just blazing helicopter pilots through the windows of their choppers without giving it a second thought, regardless of the shooting statistic. The meaningful difference comes from a character-specific ability. Franklin uses his while driving, getting a slow-motion moment or two while significantly increasing a car's steering, which keeps you from getting too turned around during races and other pursuit-like activities. Michael has a standard on-foot bullet time that makes the shooting even easier than it already is. And Trevor goes into a rampage-like state where he takes less damage. They all have their uses, but as long as you're patiently using the game's competent cover system and letting your health regenerate (it only pops back up to 50 percent, though) between shots, you'll make it out of most fights alive and well, no <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/body-armor/3015-285/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-285\">body armor</a> required.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The game is at its best when it deviates from the typical GTA mission structure, and you'll do this several times over the course of the story in the form of heists. These big scores are typically placed at pivotal points in the story and require some additional planning. Typically you'll start a heist situation by choosing one of two approaches to taking a score. One may require more setup but it might also have a lot less risk than, say, walking in the front of a jewelry store and gunning down everyone in sight. Once you've decided how you'll take the score, you'll have to choose a crew. In addition to the other protagonists (who are usually all together on every job) you may have to choose a getaway driver or find someone that's handy with an <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\">assault rifle</a>. You'll choose these crew members based on their stats and the cut of the overall take that they'll get at the end. Choose an inexperienced shooter and he may die on the job--and if he happened to be carrying a significant portion of the score, well, that's money you won't be getting at the end. If a member of the crew lives through the job, his or her skills will increase, but the percentage won't, giving you some incentive to rank up your low-level, low-paid criminals on the earlier jobs. As you play the game, you may find additional people who will want to take down scores with you, giving you a wider pool to pick from.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2542557-877-1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2542557\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2542557-877-1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2542557\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2542557-877-1280.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2542557-877-1280.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Franklin wants to be an upwardly mobile criminal, not just some two-bit gangbanger.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The heists often require some additional setup, too. If your heist needs masks, well, you're going to go buy some masks. Need a getaway car? Go find a four-door vehicle and you'll be able to choose your own stash spot to hide it in--just remember that you'll need to actually drive there in the middle of the heist. Specific cars, like firetrucks and maintenance vans, must also be sourced in some instances, so you'll have to go and steal those at your leisure. Having these more-freeform tasks appear right before the heist is an exciting change from how Grand Theft Auto typically unfolds, and my only complaint is that I wish there was a lot more of it. Once you've completed all the setup, you can head out and take down some scores.</p><p style=\"\">When out on the heist, you can usually swap between the three core protagonists. So if you don't feel like flying a helicopter, you often don't have to--just don't swap to Trevor. The game does force swaps in specific occasions, though, and it typically does this to ensure that you're not missing the action. Annoyingly, the characters you aren't using aren't always on top of their game. I had a couple of missions end randomly because one character or another would die on the job, without any sort of warning that they're even in trouble. It felt like the typical sloppiness that comes with the average open-world game, right alongside trying to drive into a respray shop to lose the cops only to have the game tell me that I failed the mission I was on by \"abandoning\" it. Failing missions isn't much of a problem; the game has pretty good mid-mission checkpoints. But if you're attempting to earn gold medals by completing all of a mission's tasks, you can't restart at any checkpoints along the way.</p><p style=\"\">The heists are the greatest part of GTAV's gameplay. The only real problem with them is that there aren't more of them. But what do you do when you're off-mission? Well, aside from the main missions and heists, the game has random events and \"Strangers and Freaks\" missions. The random events are things like armored cars that drive around the city, begging to be taken. Or you'll find plenty of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/automated-teller-machine/3055-2864/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2864\">ATM</a> robberies that you can foil, if you like. The Strangers and Freaks missions are more structured, and some of them spin out into the typical sort of side missions you might expect from an open-world game. Some are basic--Michael runs into a woman jogger who riles him up to the point where he demands a foot race with her. Franklin gets mixed up with some marijuana legalization weirdo who wants him to recover a couple of coolers full of weed from around the city. Trevor gets involved in a bail bonds operation that has him tracking down bail jumpers. He also falls in with a couple of guys who think they're running some kind of border patrol operation, and the three of them go off and use stun guns on men with vaguely Mexican-sounding accents. Some of them are funny, and some of them bring a lot more weirdness into what would otherwise be a pretty by-the-numbers crime saga. So they make for a nice break from the action.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2540004-2-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2540004\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2540004-2-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2540004\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2540004-2-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2540004-2-1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some heists go smoother than others.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game also has a lot of other activities. There are movie theaters to visit with short, pre-rendered, overly-compressed and badly artifacted \"films\" you can watch. There's a golf course, complete with a passable little golf game. You can get into tennis. Or take up skydiving. You can take bong rips and watch TV at your house. One side mission has you driving a tow truck and towing specific vehicles back to an impound yard. You can use your phone's built-in web browser to invest in the stock market, complete with a series of assassination missions that allow you to influence said market a little more directly. And so on and so forth. I tried a little bit of everything and found a lot of it to be distracting and largely unnecessary, given the quality of the main story, but if you're going to make an open world game, you might as well fill it up with a bunch of different optional events. But personally, I'm done with checkpoint races in open-world games. This game already has plenty of driving in it without tacking on a ton of additional driving-only missions.</p><p style=\"\">The writing associated with those main characters and their stories is the best part of Grand Theft Auto V. It strikes a weird tone that occasionally veers into comedy, particularly the subplot involving Michael's estranged family, all of whom think he's sort of a washed-up joke that's suddenly become an old psychopath. But at other times it's deathly serious. It manages to work more often than it doesn't, even if Franklin and his motivations for sticking around these two aging bank robbers feel a little thin. Tonally, however, the game is all over the map once you take the radio and everything else into account. The radio, its talk shows, and its news clips are straight-up classic Grand Theft Auto, poking fun at the \"American Dream\" and everything that comes along with it. A lot of the radio chatter, funny as it can be, ends up giving the game an almost nostalgic feel. It's the thing that comes on and reminds you of all those other times you spent with a Grand Theft Auto game, listening to the writers' satirical take on America. But this time you can slot in financial bailouts, fracking, and reality TV as the topics that pop up around the world and remind you that it was written for 2013, not 2004. It would have been great to see this aspect of the game evolve a bit more, from a writing perspective, anyway. As it stands, it all feels expected and unadventurous, hardly the biting satire that it felt like in past outings. Presentationally, though, it is great, with news reports that tie into the main missions and a sharp, varied selection of music... even if the mere concept of turning on a terrestrial radio in this day and age comes off as a little quaint. Sometimes, the tone of the radio and the dopey lines coming out of pedestrians as you work your way around the city feel sharply at odds with the tone of the actual missions.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2543891-gta5_gtainside_exclusive.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543891\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2543891-gta5_gtainside_exclusive.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2543891\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2543891-gta5_gtainside_exclusive.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2543891-gta5_gtainside_exclusive.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The playable area includes plenty of unincorporated space north of Los Santos, with trailer parks and meth labs.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That said, the individual pieces of Grand Theft Auto V are nicely done. The driving is a lot looser and more exciting than it was in <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20457\">GTAIV</a>, and the lock-on targeting and cover system means that you're never fighting the controls in the middle of combat. It also looks great on current consoles, with a solid draw distance and a frame rate that takes few major hits along the way. Furthermore, the characters themselves emote well in cutscenes, which really helps make the story feel more meaningful. The city itself is nicely evocative of Los Angeles, as well, giving you GTA-ified equivalents of studio lots, the TCL Chinese Theatre, the Santa Monica Pier, and more. Little touches like lighting as the sun rises and sets go a long way, too. That all meets well with the game's on-foot and on-mission soundtrack, which delivers tense backing tracks that heighten the heists whether you're opening fire on the obstacles in your way or watching Michael slyly convince a guard that he is, in fact, supposed to be there. And all of it comes together to bring you a fantastic approximation of LA's sleazy-yet-sunny West Coast vibe.</p><p style=\"\">In a lot of ways, that sort of vibe--or the skill with which it is achieved--is the real star of any Grand Theft Auto. Overall, this game is less surprising than you might like, because so much of it is precisely what you'd expect from a GTA game. As other open-world games push forward in ways that make things like traversal more convenient, GTA forces you to look at the minimap for your turn-by-turn directions. At times, it feels like it was made in a vacuum, away from the influence of other games. But while you could certainly pick out a handful of individual systems or design choices that feel like they've been handled more intelligently elsewhere, none of those other games bring together so many interesting and disparate systems with the same level of aplomb on display here. That, combined with the game's unique multi-character approach to storytelling, makes Grand Theft Auto V an exciting successor in the long-running franchise.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>", "deck": "Grand Theft Auto V's unique storytelling meshes well with standard GTA-style action, giving you multiple perspectives on some fantastic criminal activities.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-598/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36765/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-v/3030-36765/", "id": 36765, "name": "Grand Theft Auto V"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2013-09-16 07:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-121148/", "id": 121148, "name": "Grand Theft Auto V"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/nba-2k14-review/1900-599/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Cover athletes are typically treated as little more than marketing tools in modern sports video games.

This year's title, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k14/3030-42632/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42632\">NBA 2K14</a>, once again tries to transcribe the story of its cover star into gameplay, albeit with less interesting results than usual.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2520066-019779.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2520066\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2520066-019779.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2520066\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/2520066-019779.jpg\"></a><figcaption>I hope you like LeBron James, because his presence in NBA 2K14, from the new \"Path to Greatness\" story mode on down to the soundtrack, is inescapable.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This year's cover man is <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/lebron-james/3005-6521/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6521\">LeBron James</a>. James is unmistakably the biggest name in basketball, and his presence looms large in this game, especially in the new \"Path to Greatness\" mode. Here, you are tasked with deciding where James will go when his contract is up at the end of this season. This immediately sounds alarm bells related to that disastrous \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_(TV_special)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">The Decision</a>\" moment from a few years back, where James went so far out of his way to make a big deal about his impending move to Miami from Cleveland that he all but alienated a huge swath of the league's fans (before most non-Cleveland folk promptly forgot about it and started loving him again). Fortunately, this isn't nearly as bad as all of that.</p><p style=\"\">You're given two potential paths to choose from. The first simply has James deciding to stay in Miami, where he is presented with a series of game scenarios related to turning the Heat into a lasting dynasty. The other seems potentially more interesting up-front, in that it has James bolt following the end of the 13-14 season to see where else he might prosper. Unfortunately, there's no real element of choice here. All the scenarios and situations presented in this mode are scripted, so when you leave the Heat, you have no choice but to go try some time in New York with the Knicks, before eventually bouncing to more familiar territories.</p><p style=\"\">The progression of the mode itself is fine. You play a series of key games, each set up by a bit of lackadaisical narration from James himself, which progresses the story as James works toward besting Michael Jordan's six championships. The best thing I can say about this entire mode is that the story does go to some entertainingly strange places (which I'd rather not spoil for those who may partake). Stuff like this is typically why I like the 2K basketball games so much. The developers' treatments of things like the Jordan Challenge in 2K11, and the classic rivalries in 2K12, are some of the most detailed and pleasingly crafted modes anywhere in the sports genre--never mind that those previous modes focused on the existing legacies of ex-players and teams, as opposed to making up imagined storylines for current superstars.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">By comparison, the emphasis on James' forthcoming decision just feels like a mildly amusing oddity. The fan-fiction quality of the storylines is cute, but not terribly endearing once you realize you have no real choice in how the story progresses. And there's just something a bit grating about James actively endorsing more speculative frenzy over the next destination in his career, even if the scenarios presented here generally come off as more playful than intentionally prophetic.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2551614-nba-xenon-0065.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2551614\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2551614-nba-xenon-0065.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2551614\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2551614-nba-xenon-0065.png\"></a><figcaption>The mapping of ball moves to the right stick in 2K14 is probably the deepest, albeit most initially unwieldy, execution of the mechanic to date. Take the time to learn it.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill here, but it just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially when you consider how little else has changed in NBA 2K14's feature set. Key modes like The Association, MyPlayer, and MyTeam are functionally the same as last year's game. Granted, MyPlayer is probably the best single-player career mode in sports gaming right now, and The Association remains as enjoyable as any franchise mode out there, but so many of the key elements of these modes have been recycled, leaving those who have already spent countless hours with them in previous sequels without much to discover this time around. MyTeam does at least get some additional modes and tournaments, but it still feels like a second-rate knockoff of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ea-sports/3010-6255/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6255\">EA</a>'s Ultimate Team modes. Online, the Crews mode has returned for those who want to compete with their created players against other online groupings. Otherwise, the online feature set is pretty much identical to last year.</p><p style=\"\">That probably won't matter much for those who just want to play competitively. The good news and bad news of this year's game on that front is that the tweaks and changes made to the controls this year make NBA 2K14 one of the tightest-playing basketball games ever, though at the expense of much of what you may have learned last year.</p><p style=\"\">2K14 goes buck-wild with the right stick. Last year's game certainly had its share of stick-based mechanics, but this year's goes well beyond any of that. Fiddling the stick back and forth in specific circles and motions will result in some crazy, if chaotic dribble moves around defenders, while pulling it back and holding will set you up to shoot. The nuances of these stick movements, not to mention the sheer volume of them available, will likely require a lot of relearning for those who got used to last year's control scheme. The good news is that learning them is totally worth it, as it gives you an insane amount of control over how you play. You can, of course, just use buttons for many of the simpler moves, but you're still going to need to learn the stick if you want to effectively navigate opposing defenses.</p><p style=\"\">Those controls will take some getting used to, especially given how unforgiving the defense is this year. Last year saw some improvements to passing that made it a hell of a lot easier to move the ball around. This year's defensive A.I. catches up to those changes. Hang around in the paint and the defense will swarm, swiping and grabbing for the ball any chance it gets. Pass even a bit wildly, and the odds of the defense picking it off climb exponentially.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/102330/2524661-679874_20130702_001_73641_640screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2524661\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/102330/2524661-679874_20130702_001_73641_640screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2524661\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/102330/2524661-679874_20130702_001_73641_640screen.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/102330/2524661-679874_20130702_001_73641_640screen.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Since this is one of the only screenshots we have of 2K14 not featuring LeBron James, I'll use this opportunity to mention that Euroleague teams are included this year.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Keep in mind that none of this feels cheap or unearned. You'll see occasional shoddy behavior from computer players (not jumping for loose balls quickly enough, too many goaltending penalties, etc.), but by and large NBA 2K14 plays how basketball should. Contact between players feels largely how it should, with size and momentum determining how effective picks and contested shots play out--hell, there's even the correct amount of flopping from certain marquee players. This is also a hard game, even on the lower difficulty settings, purely by virtue of how smartly opposing teams play. Areas like play-calling and passing have again been tweaked to try and simplify the process for dummies like me, and those changes are certainly appreciated. But even still, NBA 2K14's learning curve is no joke.</p><p style=\"\">For those reasons, along with the series' continued best-in-class visual presentation and broadcast commentary, I have no issue recommending NBA 2K14 to those looking for another tightly-tuned, exquisitely deep game of basketball for their current generation consoles. It'll certainly help if you have a particular interest in King James and his future endeavors, but NBA 2K14 has more than enough quality content to keep LeBron haters happy too.</p>", "deck": "2K continues its tradition of eminently deep and thoroughly entertaining basketball simulations, albeit without many changes to its feature set.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-599/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42632/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k14/3030-42632/", "id": 42632, "name": "NBA 2K14"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-09-26 14:08:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127832/", "id": 127832, "name": "NBA 2K14"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/beyond-two-souls-review/1900-600/", "description": "<p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/david-cage/3040-20744/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-20744\">David Cage</a> has gone and made his game again.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2226821-beyond_screen_107z7y7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226821\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2226821-beyond_screen_107z7y7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226821\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33880/2226821-beyond_screen_107z7y7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Meet Jodie Holmes.

Cage and his team at <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/quantic-dream/3010-2005/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2005\">Quantic Dream</a> have dedicated themselves to a laserlike focus on melding cinematic storytelling with the interactivity of video games, and Beyond is perhaps the best realized version of those ideals and mechanics. In Beyond, Cage has developed a game that shows far greater production value, offers significantly better acting talent, and tells a far more coherent story than anything his studio has tried previously. And yet your enjoyment of Beyond will once again depend entirely on how willing you are to get behind what a David Cage game unwaveringly is, not to mention how willing you are to forgive some frequently hokey, and downright maddening plot nonsense.</p><p style=\"\">The Two Souls part of Beyond's title refers to the dual entities you control throughout the game. Primarily, you're in control of Jodie (<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ellen-page/3040-102137/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-102137\">Ellen Page</a>), a woman born with an equally exceptional and unfortunate gift. She possesses an attachment to an unknown spirit she refers to as Aiden. Aiden's existence is, for many years, inexplicable to her. She was born with this spirit tethered to her, and in limited capacities, she can make Aiden perform specific tasks. By and large though, Aiden is an enigma to her and everyone around her, which makes her existence both enticing and worrisome to the various forces that take an interest.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Beyond takes place over the course of 15 years of Jodie's life. The events unfold in nonlinear fashion, darting wildly between the trials of her early childhood, to the many years she spent in relative confinement in a government lab, as well as the years she spent both working as an operative for the CIA, and running from the agency as a fugitive. Jumping from time period to time period isn't quite as confusing as it might sound. Cage's script is mindful about how it metes information out over time, establishing characters and situations with a (mostly) light touch. Cage actually does a pretty good job of making Jodie's character development feel at least somewhat organic, considering the bizarre situations she's thrust into over the course of the game.</p><p style=\"\">And let me tell you, some of that stuff is completely, utterly insane. It's hard to know where to start when trying to pinpoint where the line between the acceptably ridiculous and the nonsensically ridiculous exists for Beyond: Two Souls. This is, after all, a game about a girl and her ghost who spend years under the care of a division of the government expressly designed for paranormal investigation, find themselves recruited into the CIA for black ops missions (that require ghost powers to execute, of course), and then go on the run all David Banner-style, hunted by both the government and various other entities that come from \"the other side\" (which the game refers to as the \"Infraworld\"). In between all of that, Jodie scares off her adoptive parents, befriends the obsessive scientist assigned to her case (<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/willem-dafoe/3040-74340/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-74340\">Willem Dafoe</a>) and his assistant (Kadeem Hardison), ruins a birthday party, fights off would-be rapists, learns close-quarters combat, assassinates foreign targets, kills a lot of cops, lives with homeless people, falls into a coma, gets mixed up in the supernatural happenings around a Navajo family's ranch, goes to fake China for a while, sort-of falls in love a couple of times, and eventually discovers the truth about herself and Aiden while saving us from our own self-created destruction.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2496286-beyond-two-souls_2013_06-11-13_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2496286\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2496286-beyond-two-souls_2013_06-11-13_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2496286\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2496286-beyond-two-souls_2013_06-11-13_018.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Cage's script takes Jodie to some pretty bizarre places, and not always to the story's benefit.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All that over the course of maybe 10-to-12 hours. Suffice it to say, Beyond tries to cover a lot of ground, and sometimes falls into deeply silly territory while trying to maintain some semblance of storytelling balance. Cage's writing has been the subject of much derision in the past, and Beyond has more than its share of laughable dialogue and painfully underdeveloped story situations. Every chapter has its own unique story element, but some feel more out of place than simply unique. And though the ending is less risible than the sort of nonsense that concluded previous Quantic Dream games, the last few chapters try to wring a lot of drama out of not much build-up, resulting in a series of available endings that don't all feel entirely earned.</p><p style=\"\">And yet, despite all this, Beyond works considerably better than any Quantic Dream game I've played to date. The singular focus on Jodie and Aiden's trials and tribulations benefits the admittedly bizarre story the game is trying to tell. Sometimes that focus betrays the game's attempts at conflict--what few villain characters do rear their head are mostly undeveloped, throwaway baddies who fail to leave much of an impression--but more often it helps ground the story in something at least vaguely resembling an identifiable reality. If you're able to just kind of roll with all the crazy ghost stuff, the shadowy government happenings, and the game's nebulously defined concept of the spirit realm, Beyond actually works, mostly by virtue of how well the interactions between its individual characters play out.</p><p style=\"\">The performances are a huge part of why that's the case. Beyond marks the first time Quantic Dream has gone for full performance capture in one of its games, meaning that the actors who play these characters actually acted out each scene in a studio, versus having their characters' movements animated by Quantic Dream by hand. The result, especially in the realm of facial capture, is genuinely impressive. Characters are expressive, nuanced, and just shy of that uncanny valley of creepiness. Body movements, especially when two characters are touching one another, are more hit-or-miss, with some sequences (especially anything particularly romantic) falling uncomfortably flat. Still, the vocal performances from the entire cast are terrific, especially Page, Dafoe and Hardison, who each bring far more humanity to their characters than any of the actors Quantic Dream has employed before. Page is especially good, primarily given the amount of clumsy, cliched dialogue she's forced to shout throughout the game. She keeps you interested in Jodie's plight even when the game itself frequently seems to want to wander off on some other tangent entirely.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2226822-beyond_screen_134pukh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226822\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.42421875\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2226822-beyond_screen_134pukh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226822\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33880/2226822-beyond_screen_134pukh.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33880/2226822-beyond_screen_134pukh.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Aiden has a variety of nifty powers, but the game is inconsistent about how it allows you to use them.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Of course, you won't be able to get into Beyond: Two Souls unless you're a subscriber to Quantic Dream's minimalist philosophy of game design. Like Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain, Beyond is less concerned with typical game action than simply providing interactive contexts for you to periodically engage. You do control Jodie the majority of the time, and moving her around can sometimes be a bit of a chore, especially if you have to drop yourself in and out of cover quickly. Other than basic movement, you mostly perform actions by tapping prompted buttons that appear on screen, holding them, pressing them in particular successions, or by tapping the right analog stick in various directions. There are some Sixaxis motion controls as well, though few of them require much more action than simply tilting the controller to one side or the other, or shaking it up and down now and again.</p><p style=\"\">All this stuff ranges from the mundane to the reflexive. Tapping the stick in one situation might just lead to you picking up a beer, at which point you'll have to tap the stick again to drink it. In a completely different situation, Jodie might be fighting off three or four cops, in which case time will slow down right before an attack, and you'll have to tap the stick in the direction of oncoming attacks to block them, while tapping again in the direction Jodie is punching or kicking to strike.</p><p style=\"\">Other times, you'll be controlling Aiden. Being an incorporeal entity, Aiden's interactions with our world are more limited. Most often you'll just be interacting with highlighted objects by pulling back on both sticks and letting go. This can do everything from simply knocking an object over, to flinging a table across a room or knocking a person straight out. You can also possess specific people, which will allow you take control of their bodies, and in some cases, you can just a kill an enemy outright. Unfortunately, a lot of this is arbitrary. Who you can kill, possess, or ignore is entirely decided by what's convenient for the scene, versus any sort of logical sense. So, of course you can kill the sniper that's sitting 20 feet away from everyone, but you can't kill the guy you need to possess to trigger the next gameplay sequence, nor any of the other random soldiers needed for the next scripted sequence. Similarly, Aiden has the ability to shield Jodie from attacks and impending danger, but can only apparently do this when it's convenient for the plot. Like, why is Jodie able to use Aiden to save herself from dying after jumping out of a burning building, but can't make Aiden shield her from the throngs of Somali soldiers looking to kill her earlier on?</p><p style=\"\">This stuff generally works best when Aiden is allowed a bit more freedom in his objectives. In the birthday party scene I mentioned earlier, you'll end up in a scenario where you can essentially torment a bunch of nasty teenagers for quite a while. That starts out innocently enough, with Aiden flinging furniture around a bit and cracking a few windows, but as time goes on, his attacks become much darker. Before I'd even realized it, I had begun flinging knives at one kid, and actually set the house aflame. Interestingly, I could have chosen to just leave the house, instead of screwing with these kids who had previously tormented me. Likewise, I could have ended the spookin' without actually stabbing anyone, but the end result of the scene would have pretty much played out the same way. Beyond does dabble in player choice, with certain scenarios presented that can be handled either by divergent actions or dialogue choices. But the game isn't really about that stuff, necessarily. Multiple endings do pop up, but they aren't reliant on particular choices you've made throughout the game, so much as they are just another choice to make late in the proceedings.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2226817-beyond_screen_12lfusl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226817\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.42421875\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/2226817-beyond_screen_12lfusl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2226817\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33880/2226817-beyond_screen_12lfusl.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33880/2226817-beyond_screen_12lfusl.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Should you play Beyond: Two Souls? That's a, uh...complicated question.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As I sit here, trying to assemble all of these previous paragraphs into a traditional concluding recommendation, I find myself struggling to come up with a simple answer as to whether you should play Beyond: Two Souls. Maybe there is no simple yes/no recommendation to give this game. For every part of it that comes together almost perfectly, there's another that's stricken by needless cliche or undercooked gameplay. Taken on a purely technical level, Beyond: Two Souls is by far the best game Quantic Dream has yet produced. Conversely, Beyond can be as ridiculous as any of the most ridiculous moments in Indigo Prophecy or Heavy Rain, and it can feel as sparsely interactive as either of those games could as well. It is unmistakably, unambiguously a David Cage game, with all the potential caveats and potential boons that label comes along with.</p><p style=\"\">All I can say is that in spite of its sometimes dopey script, its slavish dedication to control mechanics that don't always quite fit, and its unrelenting desire to stuff in as many obvious blockbuster movie references and cliches as a single game can hold, I enjoyed the experience of playing Beyond: Two Souls. It certainly won't change the minds of anyone not interested in Cage's particular brand of game, but for my money, I think Cage at his best still earns your attention by sheer virtue of what he aims for, and sometimes even manages to capture, if only for fleeting moments and sequences.</p>", "deck": "It's guilty of both overbearing goofiness and unearned self-seriousness, yet Beyond: Two Souls is still easily Quantic Dream's most fully-realized game to date.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-600/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38541/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/beyond-two-souls/3030-38541/", "id": 38541, "name": "Beyond: Two Souls"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-10-08 10:47:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-118587/", "id": 118587, "name": "BEYOND: Two Souls"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-stanley-parable-review/1900-601/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2561596-map10000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2561596\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2561596-map10000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2561596\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2561596-map10000.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Will you get up the nerve to even leave your office?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-stanley-parable/3030-43344/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43344\">The Stanley Parable</a> is a genius bit of interactive fun that originally started out as a free mod for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/source-engine/3015-751/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-751\">Source Engine</a>. It plays around with the concepts of game narration and player choice in some really inventive ways that will likely appeal most to people who enjoy thinking about the nature of games and the push-pull relationship between their creators and their players. But that's really only half the story, if that. The core of The Stanley Parable only works because it's genuinely funny. It's brief, but powerfully effective, with plenty of moments where you think you might have found a situation that the creators didn't account for... only to be proven wrong yet again. Once you've replayed as many different paths as you can think of, there won't be much reason to go back and play it again, but the few hours you'll probably spend with The Stanley Parable are worth its purchase price.</p><p style=\"\">The crux of The Stanley Parable is as follows: The narration will tell you what happens next, and you can either do that thing or, in most cases, do some other thing. Or maybe do nothing. The opening of the game, for example, strongly implies that Stanley--a worker drone who seems to push buttons for a living with next to no authority or autonomy in his job--leaves his office. From there, you can walk out of the office immediately, stick around in the office until the narrator pipes up to account for your complete inaction, or close the door leading out of your office, triggering one of the game's many different conclusions. The decisions spin out from there, rarely becoming complicated but definitely becoming more and more ridiculous. You poke at The Stanley Parable and The Stanley Parable pokes back. Restarting the game--whether that's your decision or the narrator's--is part of the game, and the way the story accounts for and occasionally addresses those restarts helps create some mind-bending twists and turns that blow the logic of the scenario apart in a handful of ways. Are you Stanley? Or are you the player controlling Stanley? Depending on the choices you make, the narrator may address you as either.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2561599-map10003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2561599\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2561599-map10003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2561599\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/26/2561599-map10003.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Do as you're told. Or don't.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Of course, none of this would work unless the writing and narration were able to keep you engaged and interested in seeing what else you can find. Both of these aspects are very sharp and keep you exploring around the edges, looking for one more way for the game to react to your current level of obedience/disobedience. There's a dry wit to the writing, which pairs well with the British narrator's performance. His exasperation when you deviate from his instruction feels genuine, but a certain amount of malevolence--or at least utter disdain for Stanley's role in this story--comes through, as well. But, most importantly, The Stanley Parable works because it's funny. Its unexpected turns are best left unexpected, so you'd do well to go into the game a bit blind, but the way it gets fed up with your performance and the ridiculous things it occasionally asks you to do are truly great.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2561602-map10006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2561602\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2561602-map10006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2561602\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2561602-map10006.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2561602-map10006.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>This is a telephone, as seen in The Stanley Parable.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's worth noting that the free, mod version of The Stanley Parable has much of the same foundation as this new, paid version, and you'd certainly get the gist of all this from that previous release. But this isn't just some simple visual makeover. The writing has expanded in some smart, more interesting directions, and the game has evolved to allow (and account for) more deviance on the player's part. The mod feels like a rough draft by comparison--you can see the bones and structure in the older release, but the rewriting and tuning of existing material along with the introduction of new material makes the final product much, much sharper and funnier.</p><p style=\"\">It's a small, very charming release. You could blow it up into something bigger, if you like, and talk about how it serves as commentary on how meaningless player choice in most games actually is, and certainly there's some amount of discussion you could have about the larger context in play. But you don't need to have that conversation to enjoy The Stanley Parable. It works because it's fun to explore the limits of the scenario and see which bits they've written smart, well-delivered dialogue for and how many different \"endings\" you can come up with as you play around.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p>", "deck": "Prodding at The Stanley Parable and seeing how it will react to your various actions makes for a great, brief experience.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-601/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-43344/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-stanley-parable/3030-43344/", "id": 43344, "name": "The Stanley Parable"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-10-20 17:43:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-130854/", "id": 130854, "name": "The Stanley Parable"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wwe-2k14-review/1900-602/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wwe-2k14/3030-41681/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41681\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wwe-2k14/3030-41681/\">WWE 2K14</a> is simultaneously the first <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wwe/3025-130/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-130\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wwe/3025-130/\">WWE</a> game to release under <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/2k-sports/3010-1860/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1860\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/2k-sports/3010-1860/\">2K Sports</a>' publishing banner, and very likely the last that will appear on current generation consoles.

Of course, that doesn't mean much in regards to 2K14, a game that was already well into its development cycle when THQ went under. If 2K14 is particularly laudable for anything, it's that it doesn't seem any worse for the wear, despite the team having to change horses midstream. It logically, and mostly likably builds upon what this series has been for the last couple of years. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2564695-wm9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2564695\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2564695-wm9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2564695\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2564695-wm9.jpg\"></a><figcaption>WWE 2K14 sets its historical sights on many of Wrestlemania's most iconic matches, as well as a few of the less iconic ones too.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If I sound a bit more muted in my praise compared with last year's <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wwe-13/3030-38395/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38395\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wwe-13/3030-38395/\">WWE '13</a>, it's mostly by virtue of how familiar much of 2K14 feels. Mechanically, very little has changed. Additional moves, including more of the OMG! Moment special moves introduced last year, as well as a new \"catch\" finisher system that lets you perform sudden, often great-looking variations on existing finishing maneuvers, are all nice enough additions. But apart from a somewhat awkward looking speed-up of strike moves (which artificially makes blocking strikes more difficult), and a modicum of improvement to the counter system, there's not much else here to get newly used to. Even after having not played WWE '13 for the last nine months, I was able to jump in and trounce the AI players almost immediately in 2K14. Bumping the difficulty up to the higher levels makes CPU matches a bit more exciting, especially now that a few of the more annoying AI glitches from last year seem to have been eradicated this time around. You'll still see some occasionally weird behavior--opponents randomly running outside the ring to tear apart the announce table, or running panicked circles around the ring when trying to get back in before a countout--but by and large, the game puts up better, more intelligent fights.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, WWE '13's strongest feature wasn't really its gameplay, anyway. It was its newly introduced story mode, a sort of historical retelling of the WWE's fabled \"Attitude Era.\" This mode allowed players to relive a number of the biggest, best, or at least most interesting matches from arguably the WWE's most exciting period, with numerous historical objectives to complete that added a layer of authenticity to the proceedings. In 2K14, the developers have taken this same concept and applied it to the industry's biggest event: Wrestlemania. Titled 30 Years of Wrestlemania, this mode covers at least one match from each of the 29 previous Wrestlemania shows over the course of a bit more than 45 bouts. This means that 2K14 has the distinction of featuring a huge roster of old school wrestling names, including the likes of Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Andre the Giant, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Ric Flair, Razor Ramon, Diesel, and the Ultimate Warrior. Of course they're joined by all the usual stars of today, though you may notice that some of the bigger names recently appearing on TV, like Rob Van Dam, the Usos, and The Wyatt Family, aren't included. It's one of those things that's the unfortunate result of development scheduling and late debuts conflicting, but it's nonetheless disappointing, especially given that precious few of those missing names are scheduled to show up in the game later as DLC.</p><p style=\"\">A few omissions on both the current and classic rosters aside, this is as deep a roster as this series has ever had, and the developers use it well within the 30 Years of Wrestlemania mode. Tons of major matches--Hogan vs. Andre and Savage vs. Ricky Steamboat at Wrestlemania III, Warrior vs. Hogan from Wrestlemania VI, and the Michaels vs. Ramon ladder match from Wrestlemania X, to name a few--are recreated here with terrific attention to detail. It's not just about having familiar faces fight each other in the video game. Each match comes with a number of objectives that don't necessarily have to be met, but doing so nets you both unlockable items, as well as in-match cutscenes that faithfully recreate big spots from those fights. Often times all you'll have to do is perform a specific slate of moves at particular times during a match, or position an opponent into a particular space to set up a big moment that takes place outside of your control. Still, each of those moments tug nicely at the nostalgia strings, thanks in no small part to how wonderfully rendered these matches often are, not to mention the many video packages that run ahead of them, catching you up on the history of some of these classic feuds.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Of course, not every single match included in the mode is a winner, and 30 Years does unfortunately begin to drag as the years wear on. Few of the matches included from the first few eras are in any way questionable choices, but as the game wanders into the doldrums of the \"Ruthless Aggression\" era and on into the current \"Universe\" era, the matches become decidedly less memorable, and occasionally just plain irritating. The irritation has more to do with the mode's sudden dive headlong into three- and four-way matches that require you to wrangle multiple AI opponents to pull off those historical objectives, which can be a real pain in the ass, even when the AI seems specifically programmed to help get you into the right spaces for those objectives to take place.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2550003-wm25cenaedgeshow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2550003\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2550003-wm25cenaedgeshow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2550003\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2550003-wm25cenaedgeshow.jpg\"></a><figcaption>New catch finishers and two-man moves are nifty additions, but they're the only big changes to the otherwise familiar-feeling gameplay. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Those few instances aside, the bigger issue is that many of the later matches just don't inspire the same nostalgic feelings that those older ones do. I can't imagine anyone was really dying to replay the largely forgettable one-off battle between Goldberg and Brock Lesnar, nor are many people thrilled at the prospect of recreating both Cena vs. Rock headliners from the last two years. Not the most satisfying way to end things, but when you peg your story mode to a specific historical theme, I suppose there's no good way around that.</p><p style=\"\">Regardless of those few issues, I enjoyed the majority of 30 Years of Wrestlemania's tour through history. It covers a lot of the big moments without necessarily being all-encompassing, and even the little minigame attached to it--a \"Streak\" mode in which you choose to either try to break a ridiculously overpowered Undertaker's unbeaten streak, or attempt to defend it as the Dead Man himself--is a fun distraction. That's good, because little else of WWE 2K14's feature set did as much to grab my attention.</p><p style=\"\">Understand, nothing has really changed dramatically or been removed from last year's game. But that's just it: most of these features are exactly what you played last year. Universe mode, the week-to-week career mode that lets you book entire shows and run randomly generated stories that sometimes resemble something close to reality, is the only mode that's seen any significant tweaking. Most of those tweaks are small, but useful. You can program specific rivalries between individual wrestlers now, and the interface has gotten a little easier to navigate. But by and large it's the same Universe mode we've had for a few years now, right down to the default split between RAW and SmackDown! rosters (which isn't something that's existed in quite some time).</p><p style=\"\">There are a few other changes here and there. Players can set up different kinds of tournaments now, including gold rush tournaments for specific belts, including those of their own design. Now you can create new belts, as opposed to just building off of the existing slate of championships already included, though most of the created belts look chintzy at best. The only other major change to the creation suite is a new ability to clone and re-edit some existing wrestlers for the sake of creating alternate outfits. I say \"some\" because only a handful of wrestlers are available to clone (with more apparently on the way via DLC), and weirdly, you still can't actually make changes (outside of existing outfit colors) to the existing roster. You have to use a created wrestler slot to host whatever new outfit or terrifying body shape you've constructed, which isn't exactly ideal. This is, at best, a roundabout solution to what shouldn't really even be an issue to begin with.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2559362-universe_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2559362\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2559362-universe_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2559362\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2559362-universe_4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2559362-universe_4.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A few tweaks to the Universe mode and creation suites are certainly positives, but most of this stuff is exactly what we had last year. At least the story editor is still kicking around.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The rest of the creation suite is essentially untouched. You can build wrestlers using pretty much the same exact array of parts you had last year, as you can with arenas, special moves, entrances (there are a few new ones to choose from this year, at least) and, of course, stories. Match types are essentially identical to WWE '13, with the sole exception of the re-added \"Slobberknocker\" match, and online play seems mostly untouched, if a bit more stable than usual. Of course, we'll have to wait and see if that holds up under the weight of a full player base.</p><p style=\"\">WWE 2K14 is as solid a wrestling game as this team has ever developed, but it does highlight a growing split between an apparent desire to craft something closer to the product one generally sees on TV week to week, and the sometimes brainless, but basically entertaining fighting game <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/yukes-co-ltd/3010-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-16\" data-mce-href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/yukes-co-ltd/3010-16/\">Yuke's</a> has been churning out in various forms for a decade and a half. As the developers build out these lovingly detailed story modes rooted in wrestling history, they end up highlighting exactly how goofy and out of sorts much of the in-game action looks compared with the many tightly scripted sequences built into 30 Years of Wrestlemania. The hope, again, is that 2K14 marks the last time we'll see this particular version of the game, and that with the bump to new consoles, 2K will grant its developers the opportunity to start fresh. Maybe that's an overly idealistic hope, but it's one I think is necessary. 2K14 most definitely satisfies whatever nostalgia I had for Wrestlemania's history, and I expect will provide ample enough amusement between now and next year's installment. But come next year, I'm considerably less certain that another entry just like 2K14 will be similarly satisfying.</p>", "deck": "WWE 2K14 traipses through Wrestlemania's storied history with expected, but nonetheless entertaining results.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-602/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41681/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wwe-2k14/3030-41681/", "id": 41681, "name": "WWE 2K14"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-10-28 10:14:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-130177/", "id": 130177, "name": "WWE 2K14"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/call-of-duty-ghosts-review/1900-603/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><em>Editor's note: Though this review takes the PlayStation 4 version of Call of Duty: Ghosts into account, the review score does not currently apply to that version of the game.

This review will be updated to reflect the differences in that version in the near future.</em></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2494771-cod-ghosts-concept-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2494771\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2494771-cod-ghosts-concept-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2494771\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2494771-cod-ghosts-concept-2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>An assortment of South Americans team up to attack American soil, with devastating results.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There are no UAVs to shoot down. Strike packages are back, and the dolphin dive has been replaced with a knee slide. You can <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/leaning/3015-2675/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2675\">lean</a> out from cover. All of the launchers are free-fire, and knife kills now come with an annoyingly forced kill animation that leaves would-be stabbers open to counterattack. Theater mode is history. Headquarters mode is nowhere to be found. Same with Hardpoint. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-ghosts/3030-41520/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41520\">Call of Duty: Ghosts</a> continues the weird trend of reversing/removing changes made by the other development team(s) that ensure that <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision</a>'s dominating shooter franchise makes it to shelves every November, but it also represents some of the largest multiplayer changes the series has seen since <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2133\">Call of Duty 4</a> redefined console-based first-person shooters for the previous generation of consoles. Here's the catch, though: many of those changes just make me want to play <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/3030-38039/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38039\">Black Ops II</a>, instead.</p><p style=\"\">In some cases, Call of Duty: Ghosts provides similar items in an attempt to iterate on existing ideas. UAVs, for example, used to fly around overhead (which then provided a clear need for lock-on <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launchers</a>). Now, the baseline killstreak item is the SAT COM, a ground-based deployable that, by default, paints enemies on your minimap if they're in your team's direct field of vision. Placing multiple SAT COM units eventually gives it a UAV-like \"sweep\" effect. Since they're on the ground, enemies can shoot or stab them out of service pretty easily--if they can find where you put them. I hated the move away from UAVs at first, but eventually warmed up to it. There's an overall reduction in airpower going on across most of Ghosts' killstreaks, which shifts the focus back down to the ground where you once again need to aim carefully but quickly to take out your targets. Compared to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/3030-35129/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35129\">Modern Warfare 3</a>, the last game to come out of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/infinity-ward/3010-1526/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1526\">Infinity Ward</a>, you'd think that Ghosts took place in one big no-fly zone.</p><p style=\"\">You'll also have some new modes to play in multiplayer, like Cranked, which gives you a speed boost and a timer when you get your first kill on every life. Once you're in this \"cranked\" state, you have to keep getting kills to reset your timer or else you blow up, respawning as normal. Search and Rescue replaces Search and Destroy in playlists, though the old mode is still available in private matches. S&amp;R mixes S&amp;D with Kill Confirmed, causing dog tags to pop out of players when they're killed. If your team recovers your dog tags, you <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/respawn/3015-989/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-989\">respawn</a>. If the enemy grabs them, you're out until the next round. Hunted starts everyone with pistols and drops low-ammo weapon cases onto the maps over the course of the match. That means you must fight your way to a crate to get a temporary crack at some random, potentially useful equipment. Blitz is a team mode that gives each team a goal point. Players try to run into the opposing team's goal to score, resulting in a ton of monotonous pistol runs from one side of the map to the other. Infected is a pretty standard \"regular guys spawn with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/shotgun/3055-5569/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5569\">shotguns</a>, but if the fast-moving zombie kills them, they're infected and swap to the other team\" mode that feels like it fell out of a <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/halo/3025-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">Halo</a> game. The inclusion of some new modes is a nice touch, but none of them are as much fun as Hardpoint or Headquarters, both of which are missing from the game.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2494775-call-of-duty-ghosts-reveal-trailer_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2494775\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2494775-call-of-duty-ghosts-reveal-trailer_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2494775\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2494775-call-of-duty-ghosts-reveal-trailer_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>For all the pre-release talk about dogs, Riley the combat mutt only factors into a couple of sequences throughout the campaign.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a> does every year, Ghosts changes up the way you unlock the same sorts of guns, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/perks/3015-366/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-366\">perks</a>, and create-a-class options. This year, you have a squad of ten different soldiers, each of which can be visually customized with a variety of different heads, hats, and clothing. These serve as different sets of custom classes, in a way, since you can't change soldiers mid-match, but you can choose from a collection of loadouts and unlocks specific to that soldier. The choice between Assault, Support, and Specialist strike packages returns from Modern Warfare 3, and the perk limits feel a bit like Black Ops II's points-based class system in that you can opt to remove items from your loadout in exchange for more perk points. Each perk--these are the character modifiers like \"don't take fall damage\" or \"be invisible to SAT COMs,\" in case you forgot--has a number of points associated with them, and you're free to choose any perk you like, provided you don't go over your points total. There are no \"pro\" versions of perks this time out. Care packages are relegated to a new \"field orders\" system that asks you to complete specific tasks to earn a Care Package drop. Some of these are simple, so when you pick up a field order briefcase it might tell you to kill one enemy from behind or get a melee kill. It also might tell you to kill one enemy while jumping or, yes, \"humiliate\" the next enemy you kill. Yeah. The game <i>actually rewards you for teabagging</i>. This might be the lamest thing to ever appear in a Call of Duty game.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Perks unlock as you gain experience points, but everything else only unlocks when you spend squad points, which are a new type of currency in Ghosts. You'll earn squad points by playing the game, and you can use them to unlock new weapons, attachments, perks, additional loadout slots--just about anything except for the cosmetic stuff. This means that if you already know what type of player you are, you can just get on with the process of unlocking the exact items you know you'll want to use. For me, that meant immediately unlocking an LSAT light machine gun with a rapid fire attachment and the tracker sight, which highlights targets when you aim down your sights but covers the rest of the screen with a blur filter that looks a little ugly on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 but has a decent depth-of-field look to it on next-generation consoles.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2485821-cod+ghosts_jungle+environment.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2485821\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"7680\" style=\"width: 7680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2485821-cod+ghosts_jungle+environment.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2485821\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2485821-cod+ghosts_jungle+environment.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2485821-cod+ghosts_jungle+environment.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game takes you around the world, both in campaign and multiplayer.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Squad points can also come out of the new squads mode, which is essentially a place to play bot matches in a variety of configurations. The core idea is that your long list of unlockable soldiers form a squad that other players can challenge when you aren't online, giving you some incentive to outfit each soldier with some better gear than they start with. If you like, you can take your AI-controlled squad in and match against one other player who also rolls with an AI squad. Or you can opt for Safeguard, which is one of the wave-based survival modes in Ghosts. This one is set on multiplayer maps and has you teaming up with other players to take on dogs, soldiers, and other AI-controlled enemies. Aside from this mode, though, the squads section of the game feels like training wheels for people who are too squeamish for the real multiplayer modes. Unless taking on AI squads or sending your AI squad out for battle becomes a great way to farm squad points, it doesn't seem like something anyone who's played a previous Call of Duty game would ever use.</p><p style=\"\">The other <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/horde-mode/3015-3021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">wave-based survival mode</a> is called Extinction, and it has aliens in it. It's not a simple carbon-copy of the window-boarding weirdness found in Black Ops II's overwrought Zombies mode, though there are certainly plenty of similarities. Instead you and a team must carry a drill around from one alien hive to the next. As the drill works to destroy each alien hive, you have to protect it and yourselves from a handful of different alien types. You earn currency as you play, which can be used to buy additional weapons or dole out power-ups for your team, like explosive ammo or bouncing betty mines. You'll also earn skill points, which are used to upgrade your character's deployables, but this upgrades don't persist from one round to the next. The goal is to get to the end of the level and then race all the way back to the start for extraction. It's not terribly complicated, but a variety of optional challenges (like pistols only or maintaining a high accuracy level for the duration of one drill session) toughen things up. The glowing alien designs look like something out of a <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/lost-planet/3025-482/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-482\">Lost Planet</a> game, which is either good or bad, depending on which Lost Planet you think of when I say \"Lost Planet.\"</p><p style=\"\">Then there's the campaign. One of the nice things about the Black Ops games was that it felt like it was at least rooted in some sort of fiction. By playing the games, you got the impression that someone was thinking about keeping things semi-plausible, or playing off of real-world events in a just-beyond-believable way. Black Ops II took a huge-but-worthwhile risk by adding a branching storyline that made every moment matter just a bit more than it has in other Call of Duty games. For its part, the Modern Warfare series was ridiculous in a really enjoyable way, with Captain Price and his big, broomy mustache doing just the sort of over-the-top nonsense you'd want to see out of a big, ludicrous action movie. It was ridiculous, but it worked. Ghosts trades all this in for a new universe that fails to meaningfully distinguish itself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2485819-cod+ghosts_deep+dive.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2485819\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"7680\" style=\"width: 7680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2485819-cod+ghosts_deep+dive.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2485819\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2485819-cod+ghosts_deep+dive.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2485819-cod+ghosts_deep+dive.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Underwater and other low-gravity environments make finding cover a challenge.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You primarily play as Logan Walker, a silent protagonist who follows his brother, Hesh (<i>Hesh</i>?!?) around as the world goes completely sideways. An ill-defined enemy blows huge holes into the United States and it's up to the brothers--who, conveniently, report to their father--to... shoot a bunch of people and eventually join up with an elite force known as the Ghosts and fight back against a decidedly underwhelming foe that only feels barely connected to the main conflict. It's hokey, with corny dialogue that eschews actual moment-building in favor of cheap emotion by playing off of the fact that you're constantly interacting with your father, your brother, and a dog. Later missions divert you to other characters as the battles heat up, but they do so in a way that feels disjointed, like someone accidentally dropped in levels from a different game.</p><p style=\"\">Story aside, the game still puts you in a few interesting situations with cool, cinematic moments, like a city near a dam that has just been blown up or a high-speed chase on the ice. It also attempts to change its pace in spots, but most of these--including the much-vaunted sequence where you play as a dog--boil down to you going prone and remaining still while enemies pass, just like that flashback sequence in Call of Duty 4. The best mission in the game has you stealing some enemy uniforms and infiltrating an installation. This mission creates the tension that the entire game feels like it's striving for, but rarely manages to reach.</p><p style=\"\">As for the gameplay in campaign, it's straightforward. The campaign doesn't branch in huge ways, it just presents itself, you perform the same basic shooting tasks you've been doing for years, it surprises you a couple of times with sequences that look better than they play, and the credits roll. Taken as the follow-up to Black Ops II's ambitious (if occasionally flawed) campaign, this feels like a huge step back.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2440235-ps4dual.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440235\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.666875\" data-width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2440235-ps4dual.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440235\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2440235-ps4dual.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2440235-ps4dual.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>After playing a lot of Call of Duty: Ghosts with a lot of different gamepads, the PS4's new DualShock 4 came up as my favorite.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Call of Duty: Ghosts has the pleasure of being the first next-generation game I've played to completion as well as being the first game I've been able to play on both current and new consoles. The PlayStation 4 version of the game looks very sharp and feels very effects-laden, with a lot of good-looking lighting and reflections. It has a long draw distance, while the current consoles occasionally fog things up a bit to reduce the amount of geometry on-screen at a given time. The campaign has an early moment where you come up and see the state of the world by looking at a shot of the Hollywood Sign, which is way off in the distance. On the next-generation consoles, this sign is sharp and easily viewable. On current consoles, it's sort of a blocky mess.</p><p style=\"\">That said, the 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Ghosts still look good on their own terms. The facial animations in the campaign are intact and the action is roughly identical across all platforms. If you don't mind some flat, occasionally ugly textures, some frame rate hitching, and a lower limit on bots (11 on current-gen versus 17 elsewhere) you could certainly get away with playing this on a current system. And if the current-generation runs it better than expected, it also holds that the next-generation versions aren't really doing anything that will blow you away. It looks nice, but it's a sharper, better-lit and textured version of the game, nothing more. Additionally, the PlayStation 4 version has a handful of noticeable dips in its frame rate. This usually seemed to happen when a lot of smoke or other effects were on-screen, but occasionally it occurred in multiplayer for reasons I couldn't even guess at. Judging graphics on a brand-new platform can be tough, since we don't have a lot to compare it with at this point, but I will say that I had hoped that it would look a little better across the board. Whether that says more about my expectations or the quality of the game will have to wait until we see more next-generation games in action.</p><p style=\"\">Ghosts offers the same style of video game combat that Call of Duty has had since 2007. The core of it is still engaging and can be very thrilling, if you're receptive to this type of action. In fact, it's still my favorite online multiplayer shooter. But the bells and whistles surrounding the game are muted and missing, leaving behind that same core without giving you enough new and exciting reasons to come back. Even with the improved graphics to be had on next-generation consoles, I'd rather play Black Ops II.</p>", "deck": "The basic core of fast-action multiplayer shooting is largely intact on all platforms, but Call of Duty: Ghosts tries new things that don't make the game better while omitting features and modes that players have come to expect from the franchise.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-603/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41520/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-ghosts/3030-41520/", "id": 41520, "name": "Call of Duty: Ghosts"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-11-05 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127352/", "id": 127352, "name": "Call of Duty: Ghosts"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/resogun-review/1900-604/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/104355/2533790-res0gun+-+ps4+-+signature+art+-+no+logos+-+jjh-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533790\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/104355/2533790-res0gun+-+ps4+-+signature+art+-+no+logos+-+jjh-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533790\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104355/2533790-res0gun+-+ps4+-+signature+art+-+no+logos+-+jjh-1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of the bosses are completely nuts.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/housemarque/3010-2107/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2107\">Housemarque</a> clearly still believes in the futuristic-retro-action-neon-light-show launch-game strategy that served them so well with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-stardust-hd/3030-793/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-793\">Super Stardust HD</a> years ago on the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>. Now they're back at the dawn of the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PS4</a> with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/resogun/3030-43628/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43628\">Resogun</a>, which is to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/defender/3030-5536/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5536\">Defender</a> what Stardust HD was to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/asteroids/3030-1034/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1034\">Asteroids</a>. And just like Stardust HD, Resogun is a game you'd be crazy not to install on your new console the day you get it, unless super-fast twin-stick shooters with pounding beats and a hell of bullets just make you sick or something.</p><p style=\"\">If you remember much about the way Defender works, Resogun is basically that, with a few extra mechanics layered on there. Each of the five levels has 10 stranded electro-pixel people that you want to save and deliver to a drop-off point before they die in their glowing jail cells. You free the humans by killing all of a set of enemy \"keepers\" that occasionally spawn somewhere in the level. If you miss the keepers before they fly out the top of the map, the associated human dies, and you miss the chance for the score and power-up they would have provided if you'd saved them. The biggest catch with the keepers is that they'll often spawn clear on the other side of the level, so if the robo-announcer lady happens to mention that some new keepers have shown up and you can't see them, it's a mad dash around the map to figure out where they are before you miss your chance.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, all of this is going on in the midst of about a zillion other enemies trying to destroy you at all times, but you've got some effective tools to fight them off. There's a crucial ability to boost, which lets you invincibly fly through enemies and bullets and then creates a little area-of-effect explosion at the end. The boost charges back up quickly, which is a good thing, since it's your most important way to not only get out of a tight spot but also haul yourself to where a human needs saving before they die. You build up a separate overdrive meter by killing enemies that lets you go into a slow-mo state and gives you a massive energy beam that ruins everything around you and racks up combo points. And then there's a map-clearing smart bomb, which no dual-joystick shooter should be without. You can sometimes pick up more of those by dropping off enough humans.</p><p style=\"\">There's kind of a push-and-pull dynamic in each level that I found myself really enjoying as I got deeper into the game. Shooting regular enemies increases your basic score multiplier, so you want to be shooting enemies constantly. But you have to weigh the importance of maintaining your multiplier, which resets itself very quickly, against staying on your toes to keep up with the keepers and save all the humans in a level. You don't have to save everyone to progress--once you've killed enough enemies, you fight a boss and move on--but it certainly behooves your weapon upgrades and final score. And make no mistake, this is a score game. There's a decent amount of variability in the way you play Resogun since there are three ships that are stronger and weaker in areas like speed, boost, and overdrive, so you can mix and match from level to level to see what play style works best where. But with only five levels that feature preset enemy distributions on a given difficulty, there's only so much reason to keep playing the game if you aren't the kind of person who likes to go for higher scores and obsess over leaderboards. If you are that kind of person, you'll stick with the game for a while.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/104355/2533783-2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533783\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/104355/2533783-2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533783\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/104355/2533783-2.png\"></a><figcaption>There is in fact a video game taking place in here somewhere.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Even if you only want to play through the five levels once--which might take you a while on anything but the easiest difficulty level, because the game is no joke later on--the spectacle alone is easily worth showing up for. Resogun features the highest concentration of neon particle effects and shimmering voxel showers you're going to find this season, and the soundtrack's tempo is perfectly timed to the action. It's also got the best retro-future arcade sound effects and post-processed robot voices I've heard in a long, long time. The game is a real audio-visual treat, even if it might make you want to go lie down after a while.</p><p style=\"\">Resogun probably owes its existence largely to Our Father of Holy Dual-Joystick Launch Games <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/geometry-wars-retro-evolved/3030-11099/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11099\">Geometry Wars</a>, and I'm glad Housemarque is keeping that tradition going. Every suped-up new console should launch with a game like this.

It's a quality multiplayer shooter paired with a lackluster campaign that starts out with promise that it completely squanders by the time the credits roll.</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/killzone-3/3030-30431/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30431\">Killzone 3</a> ended poorly, with a devastating blast that rocks the enemy planet of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/helghan/3035-270/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-270\">Helghan</a> and elicited nothing but shrugs and a chuckle from this reviewer. Killzone: Shadow Fall on the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> flashes forward from that moment and attempts to make good on it with a premise that attempts to reframe the conflict between the fearsome <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/helghast/3015-195/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-195\">Helghast</a> and the people of planet <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/vekta/3035-1973/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1973\">Vekta</a>. The campaign has some exciting early moments, but the middle starts to sag and the final chapters are straight-up bad. Along the way the game really tries to hammer home that old \"war is hell\" motif by showing you more of both sides than you've seen in previous games, hoping that you'll start to wonder who the bad guys really are in this ongoing conflict. It's more than a little ham-fisted in its delivery, though, with stock characterizations and a lot of corny dialogue. It has all the subtlety of flashing a title card that reads \"WHO IS THE REAL MONSTER??????\" every 30 minutes. On top of all that, the ending actually manages to be <em>worse</em> than Killzone 3's final moments.</p><p style=\"\">The campaign starts strong, with a solid setup and an early mission or two that gives you the feeling that Shadow Fall is going to be more open than its predecessors, with more opportunities to use tactics and take alternate routes to reach your goals. But after that first mission or two, the mid-game is an empty husk, like the developers spent a ton of time making large, intricate areas for you to navigate, and then forgot to put anything interesting to shoot at in most of the levels. One mission largely consists of you running around a seemingly dormant research ship and moving large batteries around to power different doors, like you're some kind of intergalactic electrician. It's a dark ship full of boring busywork, the kind that people tend to play video games to get away from. It isn't even presented as a puzzle, because the items you need to open the doors are usually sitting right next to the empty sockets you need to fill up. It's all downhill from here, culminating in a set of final moments that are just straight-up bad, including one area where you're gliding, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pilotwings/3030-14727/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14727\">Pilotwings</a>-style, through a collapsing city. It looks impressive, but the controls are rotten, resulting in many, many restarts. Once you safely memorize the level and land, you're allowed to play through the final areas, which pit you against large enemy robots that require more fussing around with power cells. Then there's the final slog, which does that thing where you're sent into large, arena-like rooms that fill with soldiers and don't offer enough checkpoints. These final bits are also good at showing off the game's questionable AI. I witnessed enemies that ran right past me to take cover against an item that wasn't blocking my line of fire at all, making dispatching them quite easy. Other enemies ran into low walls and kept running, unable to figure out how to mantle over and continue moving. Still others were just running back and forth across a hallway, as if they couldn't decide which way would be best.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/74501/2440356-original-4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440356\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2048\" style=\"width: 2048px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/74501/2440356-original-4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440356\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74501/2440356-original-4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Are the Helghast terrorists? Or freedom fighters? Does it matter?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's all so frustrating to see because the campaign starts out with such promise. At the beginning of the game you're given a robot buddy called an OWL, and it gives you four secondary abilities that you can call upon over and over again. One sends the OWL out in drone form, where it hovers just overhead and shoots at enemy targets. That's probably the most useful. Another shocks and stuns enemies, but it's really only necessary when you're dealing with shielded enemies that only show up near the end of the game. One ability pops a translucent shield that you can fire through, and the last is a zipline that lets you traverse large areas--but most of these large areas are frontloaded, so as you continue, you have less reason to zip around from one place to the next. In a better game, these abilities would feel refreshing and mix things up nicely. Instead they just feel like another missed opportunity.</p><p style=\"\">The multiplayer follows a lot of the popular concepts in persistent multiplayer shooter design, with loadouts that you can customize with different primary weapons, pistols, and abilities. Furthermore, all these items are broken out across three classes, so scouts get the sniper rifles and cloaking device, support guys lay down <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/light-machine-gun/3055-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1808\">LMG</a> fire and revive downed teammates, and assault takes standard rifles, speed boosts, and other middle-of-the-road abilities. Unlike most of those other multiplayer shooters, most of the options in Shadow Fall's class system are available right off the bat, with no unlocking required. The abilities will level up and become more effective as you use them, and weapon attachments like flashlights, laser sights, under-barrel shotguns, and scopes unlock as you use each of the weapons. But there aren't any experience points to earn and no levels to gain. Instead the game ranks you by the number of challenges you've completed, and there are well over a thousand, ranging from weapon- or ability-specific sets of tasks to things like being the MVP once on each of the game's maps. It's an interesting approach, but since there are still things to unlock, you'll still be working to fine-tune your loadouts to your liking as you play.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The competitive end of Killzone: Shadow Fall looks sharp and runs at a faster frame rate than the single-player, and it has that signature Killzone pacing to it that makes it feel different and more deliberate than the modern-military shooters that dominate the genre these days. The weapons are loud and satisfying to fire. The kills take just enough ammo to feel like you earned them. And you'll be able to focus on a lot more than just shooting people in the face. The way the warzones can be configured means you'll always have something slightly different to try. You can built your own server configuration by setting a map rotation, allowing or disallowing any of the specific weapons and abilities, forcing factions to play as specific classes, setting a number of respawns, allowing or disallowing bots, and so on. This means that if you want to limit the action to just beacon retrieval missions and search &amp; destroy sections while ensuring that every player is using a pistol, you can. In fact, as of this writing, that mode is up and already available. The level of match customization helps keep things fresh since you can get out and find players playing in a variety of different ways.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/74501/2440353-original-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440353\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2048\" style=\"width: 2048px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/74501/2440353-original-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440353\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74501/2440353-original-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74501/2440353-original-1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wait, did someone turn on friendly fire?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That level of customization can clash with the way player loadouts are built and saved, though. If you go into a warzone with restrictions on which equipment you can use, the game doesn't give you a separate set of appropriate loadouts or build new defaults that are tailored for the current ruleset, so the first time you join up you have to frantically create new combinations of items and save them to one of the four slots you get for each class. If you're only flipping between standard rules and a pistols-only warzone, this isn't a big deal. But if you start to jump around from one set of rules to another and create your own along the way, you'll find yourself constantly overwriting your slots. The game could be better about handling part of this process for you, but the level of choice you're given over creating a server and tweaking the rules is worth the bit of discomfort up-front.</p><p style=\"\">Still images of Shadow Fall look outstanding, and it often looks great in motion, too. The environments are large and the lighting is technically proficient, if a little overused. The opening mission gives you a lot of volumetric lighting through the trees and a lot of the enemies have blinding <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/flashlight/3055-156/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">flashlights</a> mounted on their guns, giving the game plenty of opportunities to scream \"hey, this hardware is powerful to handle all this now!\" The light show settles down after a mission or two and gives you some good-looking dark areas, too. The environments are usually large, though the game doesn't give you a ton of reasons to explore unless you're into collecting audio logs and comic book pages. The multiplayer runs at a higher frame rate than the campaign, but the multiplayer also has an odd motion blur effect that makes the game look overly blurry. Also, on some maps the blur effect that kicks on when you start running takes a little too long to clear up when you stop moving, which is distracting and a little ugly.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/74501/2440359-original-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440359\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2048\" style=\"width: 2048px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/74501/2440359-original-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440359\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74501/2440359-original-7.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74501/2440359-original-7.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are plenty of robots and drones to deal with in both single- and multiplayer.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">For me, Killzone's visuals have always lived and died by its design and animation. Even if that first game was pretty bad, the Helghast looked awesome, like fearsome future Nazis that you couldn't wait to gun down. At this point in the story, the need for thick, baseline troopers is a bit diminished, so you'll face more nimble-looking, cloaked Helghast. The game attempts to retain some of the signature looks of the enemy, with glowing eyes and black garb, with varying degrees of success on the different types of foes. The animation feels canned now that the rest of the visuals around them look so great, and there are plenty of moments in the campaign where you see an AI ally snap into a locked standing position to deliver a line of dialogue, then jerk out of that pose into a scripted walk over to a door, where they turn turn and snap back into a talking position to say something, and so on. Things like climbing ladders feels extra robotic, too. Plenty of other games have these sorts of issues, but it would have been nice to see some of those rough edges smoothed out on new hardware.</p><p style=\"\">Killzone: Shadow Fall is a real mix of highs and lows, so where you come out on it will depend on your interests. If you don't care about campaigns in your first-person shooters, Killzone provides a solid alternative to the modern-military games that are all the rage these days. It's highly configurable and the developers claim to have multiple free updates in mind for future expansion. But if you want a story and like to shoot your way through a great campaign, Shadow Fall has too much downtime and too many frustrating moments to recommend.</p><p style=\"\">At least <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rico-velasquez/3005-1795/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1795\">Rico</a> isn't in it.</p>", "deck": "The campaign is a real drag, but Shadow Fall's multiplayer props up the package with its fun, configurable action.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-605/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41690/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/killzone-shadow-fall/3030-41690/", "id": 41690, "name": "Killzone: Shadow Fall"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-11-17 12:24:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-125458/", "id": 125458, "name": "Killzone: Shadow Fall"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/knack-review/1900-606/", "description": "<p style=\"\">With new console launches, there is a general understanding that a certain variety of game types must be available during those launch periods to try and rope in as many specific audiences as possible.

This action-platformer from <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sony-corporation/3010-3223/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\">Sony</a>'s <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sce-japan-studio/3010-2472/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2472\">Japan Studio</a> seems tailor-made to fit a particular audience's needs. And that's precisely what's wrong with Knack: it feels more like an obligation met out of necessity than a game anyone would actually want to play. That obligatory vibe permeates every aspect of Knack's design, from its coherent-yet-dreadfully-dull story, to its rote combat and platforming mechanics. Technologically speaking, there are areas where Knack certainly shows off some of the PlayStation 4's power, but at best, that makes it a competent tech demo, and not much of a game.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2440212-8493773578_94353975b0_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440212\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2440212-8493773578_94353975b0_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440212\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2440212-8493773578_94353975b0_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Meet Knack. Knack kind of sucks.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The titular Knack is a being comprised entirely of mysterious \"relics.\" Relics are the game's shorthand for its especially nebulous brand of MacGuffin, an ancient power that exists in this strange world inhabited by both humans and goblins, who appear to be regularly at odds with one another. Relics serve as an all-purpose power source for both societies, and Knack is the construction of a magnanimous scientist who then strangely sets about having Knack kill anything that causes humanity problems. In this case, it's a combination of rebellious goblins, a blandly diabolical industrialist bent on world domination, and some other scattered mysterious forces that the game never invests much effort in explaining.</p><p style=\"\">If I'm dismissive of Knack's attempts at storytelling or characterization, it's because they're terrible. The humans Knack is surrounded by--the decidedly <em>Jonny Quest</em>-like trio of a smart, if overly ambitious scientist, a hunky blonde adventurer, and a boy assistant who doesn't really do much except get into trouble and spout occasional morals to the story--are all bland archetypes that are as forgettable to look at as they are in personality. There are some troubling notions at the center of the story that make these characters particularly awful; namely their seemingly blithe attitude toward the long-persecuted goblin race's rebellion (it's never explained who, exactly, started this conflict in the first place), and total lack of regard for the destruction Knack causes when they send him off to kill stuff. But even with those elements disregarded, the bigger issue is that nobody in this game has enough personality to make them worth paying attention to. Every character is a weak caricature or stereotype hastily sketched into a script that appears only mildly interested in doing anything but setting up simple scenarios in which Knack may wreak some manner of havoc.</p><p style=\"\">It doesn't help that Knack is the least-developed character of them all. All you'll remember about him is his incongruously thunderous voice, his deeply limited cache of bad one-liners, and his junk-art-sculpture-of-a-Muppet character design. Regarding that last bit, Knack's body consists of varying numbers of relics pulled together into a wireframe of a character. That size shrinks and grows as the game requires, leaving you a tiny, skittering creature in some cases, or a hulking, apocalyptically destructive monster in others, but none of his forms are very memorable. Knack is neither cute nor especially terrifying. He just sort of <em>is</em>. In fact, one of the strangest things about Knack is just how deeply self-conscious the game's developers seem to be when it comes to Knack's likability. The game frequently digs through the lost-and-found bin of computer animated movie cliches in some misguided attempt to present Knack as the cleverest, most likable video game hero, but the character himself has no identifiable personality. All he does is spout hoary pre-battle quips and generically heroic platitudes, while the human characters around him make all the actual (usually terrible) decisions. Even the closing credits reek of minor desperation, as they feature Knack in various forms dancing to The Heavy's \"How You Like Me Now.\" It's so out-of-whack with what meager level of interest the game and character actually provide that it borders on tragic.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">If anything, the closest analog I can draw for Knack is Poochie the Dog. He's the sort of personality that comes off as born of boardroom groupthink, a creature meant only to hit specific personality traits that test well with specific demographics for the sake of achieving appropriate levels of audience engagement and subsequent merchandising. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game itself feels just as coldly constructed as well, offering up a brutally dull, completely repetitive slog toward a metaphorical fireworks factory that never, ever arrives.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2496244-knack_2013_06-11-13_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2496244\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2496244-knack_2013_06-11-13_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2496244\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2496244-knack_2013_06-11-13_002.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Knack's special armors and stealth abilities are briefly touched upon, then quickly forgotten.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You certainly can see the makings of something more interesting in the early goings, if nothing else. Though the tutorial level's awkward info-dump of backstory is obnoxious--the scene literally opens with the doctor starting an explanation with \"As you all know...\" before talking for several minutes about the things all the people in the room presumably already know--the initial introduction to Knack's mechanics and abilities gives you the impression the game might grow into something. You're presented with Knack's basic attacks, his ability to absorb additional relics to become larger, and his special attack meter which comes from cracking and absorbing the energy from special \"sun stones.\" You play with these initial offerings, and think that maybe, just maybe, this might evolve into something creative and entertaining. That never happens.</p><p style=\"\">Instead, Knack falls into a simplistic, yet oddly frustrating rhythm that it never bothers to try to break out of. Every level consists of the same basic combat scenarios over and over again, with Knack only able to use his same three-punch combo, his one jump attack, and his few sun stone attacks in constant repetition in clearing small area after small area of bad guys. At least your opponents have some variety to them in their attack patterns, but what little enjoyment one might wring from frequently studying new enemies is all but obliterated when you realize just how often you'll die in this game.</p><p style=\"\">The challenge level on the default difficulty is surprisingly unforgiving. One or two hits is usually all it takes to kill Knack, and the game's checkpoint system is shockingly infrequent, often forcing you to redo multiple battles again and again as you try to get back to where it was that you died in the first place. Tuning the game down to easy alleviates this, but arguably too much, as by that point you're basically just running into a room, punching a bunch of goblins or robots or whatever, and then continuing to do that until you run out of game. What few jump puzzles and environmental traps there are don't offer much challenge to speak of, and the only other abilities Knack ever earns--namely ice and wood armors, and a crystalized \"stealth\" form--are used so sparingly that they scarcely register over the din of endless enemy smashing.</p><p style=\"\">As an aside, you can also attempt to combat the game's difficulty somewhat by including another player, but the game is only partially retrofitted for cooperative play. A second \"robo\" Knack is playable on-screen, but the camera scarcely pays any attention to them. If they wander off-screen, it's up to the player to find their way back into primary Knack's camera view, which is obviously not quite ideal.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2440210-8492672651_f72f88bf36_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440210\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2440210-8492672651_f72f88bf36_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2440210\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2440210-8492672651_f72f88bf36_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2440210-8492672651_f72f88bf36_o.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's no denying that Knack's visuals are technically proficient, but they're also deeply lacking in personality.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The single, solitary argument one could make in Knack's favor is that of its visuals. Indeed, Knack certainly appears to take decent advantage of the PS4's increased horsepower. Most notably, Knack himself, with all his various pieces and doo-dads, is initially a nifty thing to look at. Elsewhere, enemies and environmental textures are super high-res, with only rare frame rate dips or other animation glitches popping up every now and again to distract you. But for all its technical prowess, Knack remains strangely dull to look at. As much as one might appreciate the sheer power on display, Knack's artistic direction is deeply lacking. Human and goblin models look recycled from some previously unseen direct-to-video animated trainwreck, while the world that surrounds Knack's adventure consists primarily of the same lava, ice, and industrial scenery so many also-ran platformers have already mined to death. Other than Knack himself, nothing about Knack's art design offers up one interesting, or even vaguely creative idea. It's all stuff you've seen before, except now in 1080p.</p><p style=\"\">I suppose that's a succinct enough description for the entirety of Knack, really. Here is a game that dutifully balls up tired cliches and flat, unimaginative game design just for the sake of filling a presumed-to-be requisite slot in a launch lineup. It does the barest minimum necessary to craft a functional, if utterly flavorless morsel for families hungry for something to feed their shiny new PlayStation 4. Some might argue that, because it achieves this meager goal, Knack is good enough. It should be acceptable, given that it is largely devoid of bugs, blemishes, or other things that might otherwise taint what its developers have set out to create. I'd argue back that when the only thing you can really say in a game's favor is that it isn't functionally broken, then it's probably got far more deep-seated issues working against it. Knack is a bad game not because it doesn't work, but because the way it's intended to work is devoid of anything resembling personality, creativity, or even a basic level of excitement. It's a product in the most soulless sense of the word, and it's not deserving of you or your family's time.</p>", "deck": "Knack is little more than a tedious slog.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-606/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41687/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/knack/3030-41687/", "id": 41687, "name": "Knack"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2013-11-18 12:28:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-125457/", "id": 125457, "name": "Knack"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/super-mario-3d-world-review/1900-609/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> is a company faced with a seemingly impossible task over and over again: remixing nostalgia. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. This means Nintendo is constantly trying to reinvent what's come before without betraying the long-standing reasons people are there in the first place. It’s hampered <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">The Legend of Zelda </a>series for years, but the team behind <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-galaxy/3025-1347/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1347\">Super Mario Galaxy </a>has shown how to pull this daunting challenge off over and over again. Super Mario Galaxy was both an evolutionary and revolutionary approach to a Mario game, finding new ways to make Mario fun to play with in 3D. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-3d-land/3030-34303/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34303\">Super Mario 3D Land,</a> however, reinvented the very concept of playing a 2D Mario game set within a 3D space. This team’s latest, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-3d-world/3030-42931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42931\">Super Mario 3D World</a>, explores this idea even further. In short, Super Mario 3D World is terrific.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2571696-super_mario_3d_world-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2571696\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.55859375\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2571696-super_mario_3d_world-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2571696\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2571696-super_mario_3d_world-3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Even the traditional overworld has been touched, with players now able to freely walk around and seek out hidden secrets.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Both in look and feel, World will be intimately familiar to anyone who's spent time with Land. But there are some key differences. World brings back the ability to choose between multiple characters with distinctive and meaningful differences, an idea sadly abandoned after (the still underrated) <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-bros-2/3030-7406/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7406\">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>. It's back in World, with players choosing between Mario (he's good at everything), <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> (he can jump really far), <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Peach</a> (she's slower but can briefly float at will), and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/toad/3005-845/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-845\">Toad</a> (dude's fast as hell). Later in the game, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rosalina/3005-1236/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1236\">Rosalina</a> from the Galaxy games is unlocked, and she comes equipped with a nifty spin move that, like Peach, can often save an ill-timed jump. Peach and Rosalina were my go-to characters in World, as their quirks often got me out of a jam, and it's not often that World rewards the player with a huge advantage for being faster. Occasionally, the game will lock some secrets behind buttons that require specific characters to trigger, and Peach's slow speed meant I was unable to gain enough momentum to reach the top of some flag poles. But importantly, these are not palette swaps to make multiplayer more visually interesting, and I suspect players will have their own arguments and preferences for \"the best character\" in the game. It adds a new-ish wrinkle to the gameplay, and it's a welcomed one.</p><p style=\"\">Let's get one thing out of the way, though. World continues Nintendo's experimentation with multiplayer in a Mario game, but as in the past, it's a superior experience solo. That said, the multiplayer is far less chaotic than the 2D incarnations, as the additional environmental space gives players a chance to avoid one another. When additional players become involved, the remarkably deep exploration aspect of World evaporates. Instead, the experience becomes about the one thing multiple people can silently agree upon: progression. Two players remains the sweet spot for engaging with multiplayer without a descent into utter chaos, but as in the past, you'll want to tackle this one alone.</p><p style=\"\">There are some wide-reaching consequences to the game's multiplayer design, however. Accommodating up to four characters in every stage means the level design has the feeling of being stretched out, and it means there's less precision platforming early on. World more than makes up for that with rapid-fire creativity, and the game's levels are still crafted in a way that makes obsessive exploration a completionist joy, not a psychological curse. Collectibles have become something of a joke in many games, a reason to unlock an achievement, rather than a reward for being curious. World continues a series tradition of encouraging you to explore every nook and cranny, rewarding the player not only for the sheer act of discovery but having the bits and pieces eventually unlock some of the game's most brutal stages. (Land's final, crazy level took me several hours to complete, even though its actual \"length\" was about average.)</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2568818-ajk3qas+-+imgur.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2568818\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2568818-ajk3qas+-+imgur.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2568818\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2568818-ajk3qas+-+imgur.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are cats everywhere in Super Mario 3D World. You cannot escape them. Don't even try.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Without spoiling the game's secrets, the development team seems aware that much of the game isn't asking for lots of precision. At one point, it <em>clearly</em> signals to the player there's no more goofing around, and the game's about to get very serious about reflexes. In Land, this came at a \"gotcha!\" moment when it seemed like the game was ending. In World, there are several \"gotcha!\" moments, to the point where it's hard to fathom the game ever ends. Instead, it only continues to get better, harder, and more interesting. Despite so many Mario games under this team's belt, almost every stage promises something new. So many games, platforming or otherwise, come up with a new trick and slavishly beat it into the ground. Here, an idea comes and goes like a ship in the night, possibly to never return again. Even if it does, you can rest assured it's been subtly tweaked.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">And just as the multiplayer has made the levels <em>wider</em>, the new cat suit has shifted the levels <em>taller</em>, as well. There's a sense of verticality to World that hasn't been present in a Mario game before, and it's going to compel you to keep that cat suit on, come hell or high water. The cat suit allows you to briefly but swiftly climb up almost any surface in the game, useful for all sorts of reasons, including making your way to the top of a flag pole. It feels like cheating, but you're smiling the whole time. Clever secrets functioning as reasons to come back to old stages has been a mainstay of Mario games, especially in the 3D era, and the cat suit means you're suddenly looking in spots that were once unreachable. Just because the camera can't show the top of the structure around you doesn't mean a green star isn't hiding there, and one often finds themselves scampering up everything around them in search of what's hidden.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2568813-ctybruh+-+imgur.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2568813\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2568813-ctybruh+-+imgur.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2568813\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2568813-ctybruh+-+imgur.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2568813-ctybruh+-+imgur.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's even a stage that's Mario Kart-themed, forcing players to run around at obnoxiously fast speeds.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">A surprising bonus is that this is the prettiest Mario game yet. World brings Mario into the high-definition age in a way<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/new-super-mario-bros-u/3030-35574/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35574\"> New Super Mario Bros. U</a> didn't dare try, and the results are astounding. Nintendo's general aesthetic, one that emphasizes simplistic and memorable designs with bold and striking colors, looks gorgeous here. It's not simply that World immediately benefits from an art direction that's flourished on technologically limited platforms, though. World begins showing what Nintendo is capable of as it's becoming more comfortable with modern graphical techniques. World sports some brilliant but subtle lighting, tiny additions that are the most visible in the game's fire-filled stages. And maybe it's just me, but I have to admit a twinge of disappointment upon realizing World isn't playable in stereoscopic 3D, a onetime-gimmick that Nintendo has expertly refined on 3DS, transforming 3D into a surprisingly essential part of the visual experience on its handheld platform.</p><p style=\"\">And there are so many other, small touches that brought me joy during my time with World. The occasional Toad-focused puzzle stages that remove jumping from the equation, a haunted house stage where the visuals become black-and-white, the lovely and memorable orchestrated music, the way characters will occasionally meow at the screen while wearing the cat suit, the discovery that completely hidden blocks appear on the screen by blowing into the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u-gamepad-microphone-use/3015-7836/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7836\">GamePad</a>'s microphone, the many nods to forgotten enemies in Mario's long history, and...well, I could keep going.</p><p style=\"\">Suffice it to say, World continues to make the case that it's possible to reinvent a classic over and over again. World might not be the same revelation that <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\">Super Mario 64</a> or Super Mario Galaxy were, but it doesn't look at traditions as a crutch, and instead uses what you know as a way to delight and entertain.</p>", "deck": "Nintendo has knocked it out of the park once again, making its latest platformer a must play.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-609/", "platforms": "Wii U", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42931/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-3d-world/3030-42931/", "id": 42931, "name": "Super Mario 3D World"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2013-11-20 16:20:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-129526/", "id": 129526, "name": "Super Mario 3D World"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review/1900-610/", "description": "<p style=\"\">For yearly franchises debuting on new consoles, there's generally two ways things can go.

The feature set on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is identical to those versions in pretty much every way. The rest of this review will just cover what's been updated for the recently released consoles.</p><p style=\"\">First and foremost, Madden 25 on the Xbox One and PS4 looks to upgrade the generally lackluster graphics engine EA Sports has been trying to scrape blemishes off of for the last several years. With the added horsepower of these new consoles, the developers have certainly succeeded in making a much better looking version of its existing visual presentation. Many of the changes are most noticeable in the arenas. Crowds are considerably upgraded from the blurry, flatly animated cutouts that previously filled the seats, and they react with a great deal more energy whenever a big play happens on the field. Score a particularly nifty touchdown, and you'll see and hear the crowd go absolutely nuts. Make a big turnover, and you can practically feel the crowd deflate in their seats.</p><p style=\"\">On the field, the sidelines have gotten the lion's share of attention. Sideline players now animate more like actual human beings, and will even step out of the way when a player comes crashing out of bounds. It still looks a little stiff and robotic, but that there is a reaction at all is actually a significant upgrade from what existed previously. There's also just a lot more detail in every little thing, from the textures of the jerseys and helmets, right down to the blades of grass on the field. When you zoom in during replays and really study each visual element, the upgrade is definitely apparent.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, when you're just playing the game in real-time, most of those changes are far less noticeable. In fact, other than some small, but welcome improvements to player animations--less bunching up at the line, a bit more smoothness in transitional animations--Madden 25 doesn't really look all that different from its previous console counterparts. The player models, though certainly shinier and a bit more detailed facially, still have those trademark goofy body shapes that Madden players have consistently had since the game went 3D. A lot of players also just don't look very much like their real-life counterparts at all, including numerous marquee players from major teams. Even the ones that do seem designed to specifically look just like the real players often still look a little bit off in one way or another. And don't even get me started on the nightmare versions of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms that show up during pre-game commentary. There is not a valley uncanny enough to handle these two.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2573346-bzsjqpgicaa9bbw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573346\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2573346-bzsjqpgicaa9bbw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573346\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2573346-bzsjqpgicaa9bbw.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Unfortunately, to really see the changes, you have to zoom in and look closely at replays. When just playing the game, it doesn't look that much better than the 360 and PS3 versions.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Fortunately, visual upgrades aren't the only thing Madden 25's developers shot for. Some gameplay tweaks to the A.I. and physics have resulted in noteworthy improvements on the field. The defensive A.I. in particular seems a good bit smarter than in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions. You'll see defenses react to formations and update their scheme on-the-fly, and react to plays far more quickly. Sometimes it's a little bit much, as I definitely noticed instances of defensive backs breaking on balls before a pass had even left my quarterback's hand. Still, those occasional cheats are minor given that defenses now respond to your play with greater intelligence.</p><p style=\"\">Ball carriers have also received a healthy dose of momentum-based physics. Cuts can no longer be made on a dime, and changing direction for all but the most agile of players now requires greater foresight. Honestly, it may have been dialed up too much. Even simple cuts felt like they required about a second more of animation reaction time than was really warranted. One second might not seem like a lot, but when you have an opposing defense bearing down on you, that's an eternity. Still, this does effectively penalize players who got by mostly by taking advantage of the previously more forgiving running physics, which is not something I'll complain about.</p><p style=\"\">Those changes are nice, but they aren't especially overwhelming either. Certainly not enough to justify upgrading to next-gen versions unless you're really hot to have the best-looking version of video game football currently available. If that is something you desperately need, you can at least rest easy knowing that few, if any differences exist between the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game, at least visually speaking.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2573311-coachglass_13.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573311\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2573311-coachglass_13.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573311\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2573311-coachglass_13.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2573311-coachglass_13.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>At least Xbox One players get the new CoachGlass feature, which is a legitimately cool new way to study opposing offenses and call your defense.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The one thing the Xbox One version has over the PS4 is an exclusive, tablet-based feature called CoachGlass. This is one of those \"second screen experiences\" you've likely heard much about, and it's one of the rare instances of this buzzterm that actually benefits the game. With CoachGlass, you (or a second player) can download <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a>'s SmartGlass app, sync it with their game, and use it to choose defensive plays for your team. It's not just about simple playcalling, mind you. This app provides surprisingly detailed analysis on both your opponent's tendencies, as well as suggested defenses for specific personnel groups, based on data collected from other Madden players. It's essentially a crowd-sourced defensive coordinator, and it works remarkably well. It's the one thing anywhere in Madden NFL 25--on any console generation--that genuinely impressed me across the board. By itself, CoachGlass isn't quite enough to recommend buying Madden NFL 25 on the Xbox One if you already have it on another platform, but it's a nice addition that I expect will be even better fleshed out in next year's installment.</p><p style=\"\">On that note, you're probably just fine waiting for next year to make the generational leap with this franchise. Unless you've held out this long on buying Madden 25 on any platform, and really, really just want a new--albeit middling--game of football to play for the next few months, Madden NFL 25 doesn't represent enough of a leap forward to make it either a technical showpiece for your new console, nor a more exciting football game than what EA already put out a few months ago.</p>", "deck": "All the features from the previous versions of Madden 25 make it into the next-gen, but the upgrades you get with this version aren't that significant.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-610/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41459/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/madden-nfl-25/3030-41459/", "id": 41459, "name": "Madden NFL 25"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-11-22 10:06:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127919/", "id": 127919, "name": "Madden NFL 25"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/nba-2k14-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review/1900-611/", "description": "<p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Considering that <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/2k-sports/3010-1860/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1860\">2K Sports</a>' <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k/3025-498/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-498\">NBA 2K</a> series has been a standout among all sports franchises over the last several years, you might expect that for the jump to a new console generation, its developers would be more than satisfied simply giving its existing game a visual bump, while keeping its various modes and features largely untouched, for a first time out. Surprisingly, that's not the case. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k14/3030-42632/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42632\">NBA 2K14</a> on the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4 </a>is a very different beast than the releases for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3055-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1463\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>. The tight, complex gameplay fans have come to know and love is still front and center, mostly no worse for the wear. But in terms of features, 2K has gone back to the drawing board on several of its biggest modes. In some cases, this has resulted in considerable improvement, but not in all. Still, even with what it's missing, the wide swath of visual improvements to NBA 2K14 alone make it worth consideration for anyone looking for a great looking sports game to go along with their new console purchase.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2569421-81ui8zl4bhl._sl1500_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2569421\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2569421-81ui8zl4bhl._sl1500_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2569421\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2569421-81ui8zl4bhl._sl1500_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>NBA 2K14 looks spectacular. I could probably embellish that statement more, but do I even need to? I mean, just look at it!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Let's just get those visuals out of the way right now. NBA 2K has always provided the best-looking representations of the game of basketball available on video game consoles, and for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, 2K has gone all-out. Body models are as realistic as any sports game I've ever seen, and the faces are especially amazing. 2K reportedly scanned the faces of 80% of the league's current players, and the level of detail in each face is fantastic. Granted, that means there is a qualitative difference between, say, a <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/lebron-james/3005-6521/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6521\">LeBron James</a> and a Cody Zeller. Less popular players look a bit more robotic when they emote, and the faces do look a bit more uncanny the further down the NBA rabbit hole you go. But the vast majority of players look really excellent.</p><p style=\"\">They animate wonderfully, too. The animation has always been this series' best feature, and this is one of those games you could very easily mistake for a real TV broadcast if you just happen to catch it out of the corner of your eye. The level of detail in each arena certainly helps, with wonderfully reactive crowds, terrific court and crowd graphics, and tons of minutae you won't even see until you pause and dig into the instant replays. The commentary from trio of Kevin Harlan, Steve Kerr, and Clark Kellogg is as good as it's ever been--if perhaps a bit more repetitive than usual--adding to an already stellar broadcast presentation.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">On the court, the game plays just as well as it did on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. All the right-stick-based ball-handling mechanics that were available on those platforms work just as well here, and the A.I. is also just as strong. If anything, it's maybe a bit tighter, but not in a way that feels cheap or broken. The only issue I noticed in this version that I didn't see in the others were a few ball-oriented physics glitches. Specifically, every now and again, a shot will hit the rim and continue spinning around it for several seconds while every player just kind of stands around. You'll also periodically see passes or blocked shots bounce off players and go flying off in some bizarre, unnatural direction. Thankfully, these only happened a few times over the hours I spent playing, and never got in the way of my enjoyment.</p><p style=\"\">With the gameplay and visuals leading NBA 2K14's featureset, that leaves the game's selection of modes to bring up the rear. The story mode from the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games, which saw players living out an imagined version of LeBron James' future career, is entirely absent here (which really isn't much of a loss, honestly), and features like The Association (its franchise mode) and MyPlayer have seen massive overhauls that leave them only somewhat resembling the previous versions. In the case of the new MyCareer mode, that's actually a very good thing. In the case of the new MyGM mode, it's a bit less so.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2569415-81tigqdyksl._sl1500_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2569415\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2569415-81tigqdyksl._sl1500_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2569415\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2569415-81tigqdyksl._sl1500_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The new MyCareer mode is a weird, sometimes janky experience, but it's also way crazier and more entertaining than anything seen in the old MyPlayer mode. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">MyGM is an attempt to personalize the experience of being an NBA general manager a bit more. Rather than just sifting through menus and doing all the dry math involved in managing an NBA franchise, MyGM adds a bit of flavor to the experience by giving your GM more personality. It's not just you, as you'll have an owner to talk to, other GMs to converse with, and a whole host of NBA player egos to deal with as you manage every aspect of your team. Really, you do end up digging down pretty deep in this stuff, as you juggle contracts, your coaching staff, and, of course, the ticket prices at your arena. It's possible to do a lighter, single-season version of the mode that doesn't require owner oversight, but the full-on mode features a number of goals and objectives given to you by your team owner. Maintaining trust with your owner has to be balanced against building trust with your players, your coaches, and the media.</p><p style=\"\">You do this with a lot of dialogue that, sadly, reads pretty badly. It's stiff, robotic stuff that has no place in anything resembling a conversation between humans. That said, if you can deal with the sterile feel of the mode, you'll find quite a lot to play around with. Keeping everyone happy is a pretty intense process that requires some smart thinking, and while the UI is a little ugly, it's easy enough to do what you need to do in the mode without getting lost or wondering why the hell anything is happening. I feel like in a year or two, the developers will be able to flesh this out into something pretty exciting. As it is, it's a deep, if not overly thrilling management experience.</p><p style=\"\">The converse of the MyGM mode is MyPlayer. This has been one of the better features of the last few NBA 2K sequels, and the Xbox One/PS4 version of this mode has been given a terrific overhaul. Now when you create your personal baller, your vicarious NBA career includes numerous cutscenes, a storyline with branching paths, and in-game challenges that provide you objectives to hit as you play. The storyline itself isn't anything too spectacular, mind you. It opens with you jumping into the Rookie Showcase before the NBA Draft, and developing a rivalry with another rookie that carries over into your NBA career. Along the way, you'll have the opportunity to decide how you react to situations on the court. You can be a dickish prima donna who only cares about his minutes and eventual stardom, or be a team player who will do whatever the team asks of him in the hopes of crafting a winning squad. Unfortunately, the choices are just about that binary always. There's very little nuance to it; you're either the worst kind of asshole or a saintly team player. But considering that before, all you could really do was make some comments during press conferences and get a few endorsements as you went along, this is still a notable upgrade.</p><p style=\"\">There are quirks, to be sure. Cutscene conversations with your GM start repeating very quickly--you'll hear him talk about Bob from maintenance's birthday no less than four times during your rookie season--and you'll see weird stuff like the same teammate show up as two different characters in the same scene, or players who are nearly a foot taller than you standing at your eye-line. There are a few issues with the in-game objectives too. Most of them are great, and make total situational sense. But sometimes it'll ask your player to take over a game and score ten straight points, even if up to this point you've just been a selfless, pass-happy point guard who assists more than he scores. Those few problems aside, I really liked what 2K was going for with this mode, so much so that I've played it for hours longer than I expected. Again, this feels more like a framework for something much better down the road, but what's there is surprisingly entertaining.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2569416-mygm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2569416\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56211812627291\" data-width=\"1964\" style=\"width: 1964px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2569416-mygm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2569416\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2569416-mygm2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2569416-mygm2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>MyGM isn't quite as fun or fleshed-out as MyCareer, but this is still a deep, fully-featured franchise mode.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Elsewhere, you can play online (which periodically seemed a bit laggy on PS4, and not at all on Xbox One), both in head-to-head battles and in the new The Park mode, which features street games in 2-v-2, 3-v-3, and 5-v-5 matches. The MyTeam mode--2K's equivalent of EA's Ultimate Team with collectible player cards--is also present and largely the same as it is on PS3 and 360, save for some additional rare players and a new Domination mode, where you can play matches against existing NBA teams and all-star squads.</p><p style=\"\">It's a solid roster of features that only looks a bit more skeletal in comparison to what was released last month on PS3 and 360, and it's more than enough to make NBA 2K14 an easy recommendation on these new platforms. Certainly, there are plenty of the sorts of issues one generally sees in launch games, especially launch games from franchises that have opted to start over, rather than just delivering a prettier version of the same game already released. But those seams in the fabric aren't enough to detract from what is otherwise a terrific game of basketball. If anything, NBA 2K14 signals that great things are on the horizon for this franchise on these new platforms, and that things are already off to a very good start.</p>", "deck": "2K Sports hits the reset button on its NBA franchise while still maintaining the level of quality fans of this series have come to expect.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-611/", "platforms": "Xbox One, PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42632/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k14/3030-42632/", "id": 42632, "name": "NBA 2K14"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-11-23 08:55:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127834/", "id": 127834, "name": "NBA 2K14"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/ryse-son-of-rome-review/1900-612/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2573827-screenshot0028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573827\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2573827-screenshot0028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573827\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2573827-screenshot0028.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll be doing a whoooooole lot of this.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ryse-son-of-rome/3030-31709/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31709\">Ryse: Son of Rome</a> is the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>'s premiere launch game, in the sense that a console launch game plays like something that could have been made on the previous hardware, if it weren't for the fact that it looks way, way better. It's a simple, straightforward hack-and-slash revenge tale that sends you traipsing through a historically fuzzy version of the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/roman-empire/3015-7127/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7127\">Roman Empire</a>, gutting and dismembering hundreds of enemies along the way. The game's core fighting mechanics are solid enough, but the lack of much else to do makes all that combat repetititve as the story wears on. At least it looks really pretty.</p><p style=\"\">You're in the role of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/marius-titus/3005-27945/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-27945\">Marius Titus</a>, son of a prominent senator and a newly anointed soldier in the Roman army. Well, Marius is actually old and grizzled at Ryse's outset, but after a brief tutorial set during a barbarian sack of the capital city, the game flashes back to the beginning of Marius' career, when his family is murdered unexpectedly by a group of assassins. From there, each chapter jumps from one highlight of Marius' military experience to the next, until you finally catch back up to the present day and the story threads, simple as they are, start weaving together. The game's villains twirl their mustaches a bit too obviously, but it's still easy to get caught up in Marius' burning desire to avenge his family and defend the honor of Rome, possibly because his character model's face has such a convincing grimace every time he slashes an enemy's throat or bangs his sword and shield together. The character performances are adequate to make it worth watching the tale play out, even if it seems obvious where it's going to end up about halfway through.</p><p style=\"\">To get to that ending, you will fight. You will fight a lot. Ryse's arena-like combat, which pits you against anywhere from two to six enemies at a time, must comprise at least 90 percent of the story campaign, so it's a good thing the combat isn't half bad. It's not quite as exacting or varied as something like <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\">Arkham Asylum</a>, but the concept is similar. You've got a basic sword slash and a shield bash that will break burlier enemies' guard, a dodge roll, and a block that leaves attacking enemies open to a counter. Managing the combat in larger groups becomes a fairly satisfying exercise in whittling down one specific enemy while dodging and countering other enemies when necessary. Once an enemy is near death, you can start an execution move that makes you hit the sword and shield buttons based on the colors the enemy is flashing during the animation, of which there are dozens.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2573836-screenshot0051.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573836\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2573836-screenshot0051.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573836\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2573836-screenshot0051.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The game is certainly doing a lot with the new hardware.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's a decent carrot-on-a-stick upgrade system at work in Ryse that makes it appealing to do more than mash your way through the combat. (Actually, you can't really mash at all, since enemies will start dodging your attacks if you use the same kind of attack too long.) Timing your blocks and combo hits precisely will break enemies' guard more readily, and increase your combo multiplier in order to put you into a \"burning eagle\" mode that makes your regular attacks more powerful. And you can select one of four perks that your executions will feed into: experience gain, health recovery, damage boost, or focus (which lets you slow down time and stun enemies around you for a short period). You can pick which of these categories you want your executions to buff at any time, so while I typically left the XP boost on so I could level faster, it was useful to swap over to health once in a while when I was almost dead. Hitting the attack prompts in an execution turns into a sort of minigame, since the faster and more accurately you hit the required attacks, the bigger the bonus at the end of the execution. Microsoft is selling experience to unlock the various combat upgrades for real money, which is patently absurd, but also hard to get upset about because leaving your XP boost enabled and doing a decent job of pulling off the executions will cause you to level extremely quickly. I had unlocked every character upgrade and almost all of the alternate execution animations by the end of the game, purely by playing it as normal.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Ryse's combat would be an effective component of a broader, more robust game, but unfortunately there's not a lot else here to occupy your attention. You'll occasionally be asked to jump onto a giant crossbow turret and take down enemies from afar, and once in a while you'll join ranks with your soldiers and advance on a position of archers, marching forward in formation until you hunker down behind your shields to withstand the rain of arrows. This looks cool but is extremely simplistic, perhaps owing to Ryse's former incarnation as a Kinect game. A few of the levels have basic branching points where you pick one of two similar paths or decide whether you want to man one of those turrets versus remaining on the ground and brawling it out. There are quite a few very impressive set pieces that have you fighting amidst gigantic battles with a realistically shaking camera and calamity all around you. Those moments are exciting from a cinematic standpoint, though at the end of the day you're mostly just performing the same combat routines in the middle of them. But they do look very impressive.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2573829-screenshot0037.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573829\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2573829-screenshot0037.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2573829\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2573829-screenshot0037.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2573829-screenshot0037.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Don't think those metal pasties are doing much to protect you there, dude.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As a launch game on a new console, looks really are Ryse's biggest selling point. This is arguably the most graphically intense game of the entire launch. The game is absolutely gorgeous in almost all cases, with a level of high-contrast lighting, particle effects, and general fidelity that gives a good early indication of how far developers can take games on these new consoles. Even when the combat starts to wear out its welcome later in the game, seeing each new area and the over-the-top action sequences that occur within them is fairly appealing in a \"wow, I haven't seen something look that good in a game before\" sort of way. If you're really hungry for more Ryse, there's a two-player co-op mode that recreates many of these sorts of scenarios, and some new ones, in a theatrical arena format, though once the credits had rolled on the story I can't say I was immediately ready to cut down dozens more enemies in the same way I'd just spent the last six or eight hours doing. If you <em>really</em> enjoy the combat, there's a separate character level and discrete equipment to unlock in the multiplayer that should add a few more hours to your time with the game.</p><p style=\"\">If you're going to play Ryse, you'd be best served playing it in smaller bursts rather than trying to tackle all of it at once. What's here is reasonably well produced--and would serve as a sturdy foundation for a sequel, should one ever materialize--but there's not nearly as much depth and variety as you've come to expect from the best games of the last few years on the old consoles. Ryse makes a good showpiece if you've bought into the Xbox One early, but at full price it feels a little thin.</p>", "deck": "Ryse leans too heavily on its merely decent combat, but at least it looks really, really nice doing so.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-612/", "platforms": "Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31709/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ryse-son-of-rome/3030-31709/", "id": 31709, "name": "Ryse: Son of Rome"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-11-23 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-128080/", "id": 128080, "name": "Ryse: Son of Rome"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/need-for-speed-rivals-review/1900-613/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495742-nfsrivals_e3_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495742\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495742-nfsrivals_e3_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495742\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495742-nfsrivals_e3_5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's racers versus cops, and the thing you'll quickly learn is that both sides are out of their damned minds.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You might not have noticed, but there aren't too many \"arcade\" racing games out there these days.

Unfortunately, the game doesn't do enough to bring players together, resulting in an online game that feels empty, cold, and lifeless.</p><p style=\"\">Unless you explicitly tell the game to keep you offline or connect to a private game, the first thing Rivals does upon firing it up is connect you to as many as five other players, all of whom will be driving around the same world that you are. If you find that they're boring or bad people, you can ditch that game in search of another. But by default, the game is one big online game with career progressions that can benefit from working together... or opposing one another. The game has two separate career paths that you can swap between any time you're not on the road. The racer career gives you races and events where you get away from the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/police/3015-1011/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1011\">cops</a>. The cop career has you busting racers and completing time trials. Each progression works a little differently, too. Racers build multipliers and earn \"speed points\" while they're out on the road. The longer you stay out, the more you can earn. But if you get busted or wrecked by the cops, you lose all of those unbanked points, making the entire game focus on the risk of losing it all in a flash versus the reward of eking out a few more points. Cops don't lose points--they take points away from the racers they bust. Cops don't have to pay for cars, but they also can't upgrade any of their cars' performance.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495738-nfsrivals_e3_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495738\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495738-nfsrivals_e3_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495738\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495738-nfsrivals_e3_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Whether they're AI-controlled or humans, the cops are a real hassle.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While the game is working ideally when all six of the players in the world are doing roughly the same thing, with cop players trying to take out racer players and so on, the open roads in Rivals are packed full of AI drivers on both sides of the law. If you're racing, you can challenge any AI racer you see to a quick race. If you're patrolling, you can hit the sirens any time you see a racer and start a pursuit. It's a large world with very few ways to force players together, though. So more often than not, the servers simply give you six players who all go about their own business as they try to complete events and sets of challenges called \"speedlists.\" If players do happen to come together and end up interacting, everyone involved earns more points. You can also use a GPS to draw a map line to the other players, but since those players are probably still driving while you're trying to catch up to them, it's largely futile. The game would really benefit from some sort of way to force players into a single event. Instead you're left to put on your headset and convince strangers that you should all drive to the far side of the map for a race or something. If you have a set of Need for Speed-loving friends, this might not be such a big deal. But if you don't, the multiplayer side of the game feels like sort of a sham.</p><p style=\"\">No matter how you play, the end results are the same. As you complete speedlists you move through chapters of a \"story\" on both sides of the career. These are edited-together clips of instant messaging chat and fake YouTube as the racer side of the struggle attempts to gain fame while the cops crack down on things as best they can. Even though there aren't many cutscenes to throw to between events, there's still enough dialogue to make both sides sound like lunatics, with the racer constantly sounding like he's just shy of trading his cars in for guns and forming a proper militia while the cop sounds like he took the job just to crack skulls with a billy club. Either way, the writers should probably seek therapy.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495739-nfsrivals_e3_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495739\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.61354166666667\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495739-nfsrivals_e3_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495739\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495739-nfsrivals_e3_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495739-nfsrivals_e3_2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>If you download the Need for Speed app for iOS or Android you can send nitrous refills or helicopters in to help or hinder your friends, but the constant app crashes and failures to connect made this a real drag.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The truly criminal part about Rivals' inability to bring people together is that it's actually a great game. Conceptually, the career advancement makes sense and makes for an interesting struggle between two different-but-relatively-equal sides. The handling is great, allowing you to weave through traffic when necessary while also letting you just tap the brakes and make minor adjustments to touch off huge, glorious drifts around hairpin turns. It also looks nice, with a frame rate that might not be as smooth as you want out of a racing game, but at least it's stable across PC and next-generation platforms. That said, the notion that the PC version is locked at 30 frames-per-second is especially ridiculous. Even still, considering its higher resolution options, it can be the best-looking version of the game, with the<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\"> PlayStation 4</a> behind it. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> version is roughly on par, but parts of it look a little grimy when compared to the PS4 version. All versions have substantial load times when you enter or exit the world, which can happen pretty frequently, depending on how often you need to change cars, pick a new speedlist, or just escape the cops for a bit.</p><p style=\"\">Rivals feels like it's on the cusp of greatness. The pieces are all there--the handling is exciting, the soundtrack is solid, and the systems that surround the multiplayer help build meaningful battles between racer and cop. But with just six players driving around the entire world and no good way to pull those players together for some true multiplayer activities, those pieces go absolutely nowhere, leaving behind an empty world that might as well not even be online at all. It's a real shame.</p>", "deck": "There's a fantastic game hiding inside of Need for Speed Rivals, but there aren't enough systems in place to draw that greatness out where it belongs.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-613/", "platforms": "PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42584/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/need-for-speed-rivals/3030-42584/", "id": 42584, "name": "Need for Speed Rivals"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2013-11-24 11:23:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127605/", "id": 127605, "name": "Need for Speed: Rivals"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/killer-instinct-review/1900-614/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495316-jago_vs_sabrewulf_24.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495316\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495316-jago_vs_sabrewulf_24.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495316\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495316-jago_vs_sabrewulf_24.png\"></a><figcaption>Killer Instinct is a fighting franchise that has always been fighting for respect... which it never got, because it doesn't deserve any. Until now.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You'd have to have an awfully foggy memory of the mid-'90s to be the sort of person who was clamoring for a new <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct/3025-1017/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1017\">Killer Instinct</a> game. The old fighting game always felt like an also-ran, combining muddy, pre-rendered graphics with a ridiculous combo system and a set of finishing moves that made the whole thing feel like it was occasionally biting from <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3025-7/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-7\">Mortal Kombat</a>. It was flashy and had a weird sense of style, but I always thought it was a terrible game, and the sequel was only marginally better. So when word started swirling around last year that <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a> was finally going to dig into more of the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/rare-ltd/3010-174/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-174\">Rare</a> back-catalog and produce a new Killer Instinct game, I wasn't exactly jumping out of my seat. But the team behind this new KI reboot has kept the charming things about the franchise intact and placed them into a better, more modern-feeling fighting game. It's still ridiculous, the announcer still screams his head off, and the combos are wild... but actually executing KI's combos is a good time, too, making this download-only fighting game an exciting turnaround for the series.</p><p style=\"\">The smartest thing <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct/3030-42896/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42896\">Killer Instinct</a> does is teach you how to play the game. The dojo mode walks you through extremely basic fighting game tutorial stuff, like \"walking\" and \"punching people.\" But then it starts getting into the game's specific brand of madness and talks about its <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/combo/3015-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-18\">combo system</a>. It has a bit more in common with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct-2/3030-21952/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21952\">KI2</a> than the original game, but the system of openers to linkers to autos to more linkers to more autos to a shadow linker to a manual to one more linker to instinct cancel to another shadow linker to more autos and, finally, an ender is easier to understand once you're walked through it. A helpful meter shows up on-screen during fights to let you know when your combo is about to get too long and blow up on its own, giving you a good warning that it's time to actually finish your combo and cash in all the damage it's been building up. The combo system feels like it gives you a lot of options, which is nice because you're going to need to provide some real variety to keep your combos from getting broken.</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/combo-breaker/3015-1258/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1258\">Combo breakers</a> require players to guess the strength of attack being used during the normal auto or manual attacks that connect your special attacks (linkers) and pressing the corresponding strength of attack to break out of the combo. The best players will probably learn exactly how each normal attack looks in a combo and react accordingly, making them very rough opponents. For the rest of us, it's sort of a mind game where you attempt to outthink your opponent and guess at the right strength. I'm not great at it, and though this process seems fair, it does provide the one thing that will probably turn people off from KI. It's a lot of fun to perform the combos, but if you're not a skilled combo breaker, getting taken for a ride for a few seconds and somewhere between 40- and 60-percent of your life bar isn't exactly a good time. Also, to keep people from mashing their way out of combos, the game will temporarily lock you out of breaking if you guess incorrectly. The three-second lockout is a long time when you're getting repeatedly punched in the face. So try to be on the dishing end, rather than the receiving one.</p><p style=\"\">When it comes to modes and options, there isn't a lot to Killer Instinct right now. There are a total of six characters, a survival mode, a practice mode, and a local versus mode. You can, of course, also get online and play ranked or unranked games. There's currently no story mode, no end boss, and only one of the six characters is new to the franchise. Why is any of this OK? Well, Killer Instinct has a few different payment options.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495311-jago_vs_sabrewulf_08.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495311\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495311-jago_vs_sabrewulf_08.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495311\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495311-jago_vs_sabrewulf_08.png\"></a><figcaption>Sabrewulf has come a long way since his ZX Spectrum days.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you just want to download KI and try it out, it's free. But you'll only get access to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/jago/3005-240/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-240\">Jago</a> (he's the most <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ryu/3005-103/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-103\">Ryu</a>-like, in case you haven't heard of him), and the developers may be rotating that free character out from time to time, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/league-of-legends/3030-24024/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24024\">League of Legends</a>-style. If you like, you can buy any one character for five bucks. That's fine, and if you know you're only interested in playing as one character, it's a passable way to go. But for $20 you'll get a pack with all six characters right now, with two more coming at a later date along with some sort of story mode. These eight fighters comprise the \"season one\" lineup, implying that <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tj-combo/3005-2244/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2244\">TJ Combo</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/cinder/3005-1399/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1399\">Cinder</a>, and some of the other old fighters may eventually make their way back into the fight as part of a second season. If you're really into that free version, you can drop $40 on a pack that contains all of those characters, a set of accessory and costume options for each character, and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct/3030-18484/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18484\">Killer Instinct Classic</a>, an emulated version of the original Killer Instinct that runs just fine on the<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\"> Xbox One</a>, though it doesn't have any online multiplayer (and is sort of terrible, anyway).</p><p style=\"\">Visually, KI is full of great-looking effects, like the burst of sparks that blast off of Jago's fireball when it lands or the rain that increasingly pounds down in one of the backgrounds as the fight progresses. If you end a fight in that stage with an Ultra Combo--the game's fight-ending finishing move--the rain goes even crazier. You see it hitting the characters and running down their bodies, which is a pretty cool little touch. The costume designs are a little flat, though. It's got good music and a great announcer, and if you earn enough in-game currency to unlock it, you can get access to some of the original \"Killer Cuts\" soundtrack to use in the game' s practice mode. I'm fairly certain that we can all agree that the best part about the original KI was the song \"K.I. Feeling,\" so having it here effectively renders that game completely obsolete.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The great training offered by Killer Instinct will help you get your feet wet, and it might just introduce you to some concepts that'll make you understand all fighting games on a slightly deeper level. That's a great touch. The flexible pricing is nice, but even at the full $40, Killer Instinct feels like a solid addition to the genre. It's also one of the better games to hit the Xbox One at launch, so if you've ever been interested in a fighting game, you might want to give this one a shot.</p>", "deck": "Killer Instinct shows you the ropes quite well and has a combo system that's fun to execute, though slightly less fun to defend against.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-614/", "platforms": "Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42896/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/killer-instinct/3030-42896/", "id": 42896, "name": "Killer Instinct"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-11-26 17:08:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-127911/", "id": 127911, "name": "Killer Instinct"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tearaway-review/1900-615/", "description": "<p style=\"\">It's difficult to write about <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tearaway/3030-39356/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39356\">Tearaway</a> without talking about the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">Vita</a>. The two are deeply intertwined. Tearaway could not exist without the Vita. The game acts as a testament to what might have been possible for a device in a parallel universe, one where it sold better and wasn't being refitted as an accessory to the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a>. It underscores what's possible when a developer views hardware features as potential, rather than marking a check box. Tearaway is a triumph for the Vita, validation of its design, even if we'll likely never get another game like it. One might be enough, especially for a game this delightful.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2292928-screenshot_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2292928\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2292928-screenshot_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2292928\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2292928-screenshot_03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Tearaway's world flips, bends, and curls as you press on.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Tearaway is a world of paper, sliced and diced. Most of us can remember sitting in class rooms or summer camps, cutting up colored paper to try and bring our imaginations to life. If we saw those creations now, we would laugh. But at the time, they were incredible--real! Tearaway's world feels like the places we were trying to build, except now it's actually in front of us. Everything around you in Tearaway is playful, bouncing and hopping around, looking for your attention at every turn. Hey! Hi! Come here! You're the center of the unviverse in Tearaway, and only you can guide the game's hero, Iota, to safety. The story will turn at the drop of the hat, yet it never feels fake. It resembles a bedtime story, one a parent might be continually making up on the fly, simply because you didn't want it to end.</p><p style=\"\">Gimmicks are only gimmicks if they aren't put to use. Technological gimmicks are common to video games. Sometimes they work out, often they don't. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> characterized the rare instance where the raw potential of an idea, motion imbued in a controller, was perfectly realized in its first piece of software, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-sports/3025-930/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-930\">Wii Sports</a>. Nintendo never found a better use for motion controls after that. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-313\">Sony</a>'s guilty, too. Developers tried their best to find reasons for tilting a Dual Shock 3 in a game, but it's mostly remembered for frustratingly walking across a log in <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/uncharted-drakes-fortune/3030-13992/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13992\">Uncharted</a>. Vita seemed liked it was chock full of these gimmicks: rear touch pad, tilt, cameras on the front and back. Rather than viewing these features as a burden, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/media-molecule/3010-6318/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6318\">Media Molecule</a> seemed to view it as a challenge. Rather than forcing these features onto an existing game idea, Tearaway feels like a game that was designed specifically to take advantage of every piece.</p><p style=\"\">Along the way, Tearaway makes you feel deeply involved in Iota's quest, and I don't mean emotionally. <em>You</em> are quite literally involved, and this has everything to do with how the game takes into account what's unique on the Vita. You, the player, are constantly featured as the sun in the sky, and the camera will flip on to remind you of that fact. When put on the spot, you can make whatever face you want, it doesn't matter, but it's a constant reminder that Iota is not alone, and you are with him. The game will ask you take pictures of yourself to become part of the environment, or take snaps of what's around you, possibly to generate a texture for a moose seeking a new look. It's an interesting and effective way to ask passive players to be \"creative\" without demanding very much effort, and it makes the world uniquely yours.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2574878-unnamed.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2574878\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2574878-unnamed.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2574878\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2574878-unnamed.jpg\"></a><figcaption>I am the king of this world, and you cannot stop me.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This extends past aesthetic customization, and into the primary mechanics, such as rubbing your fingers on the rear touch to have fingers pop into the world (you can even customize skin color!) and flicking objects on the primary screen to reveal hidden platforms and rooms. Though Tearaway is a game you're playing on a handheld system, it feels alive and tangible in a way games usually aren't, since you are constantly physically interacting with the Vita beyond tapping X or O.</p><p style=\"\">The game breaks the fourth wall in other crazy ways, too. There's an in-game camera system, one clearly inspired by Instagram. These photos do not exclusively live in the game, and can easily be shared on Twitter and elsewhere. One of Tearaway's collectibles involves snapping photos, which unlock papercraft models players can download, print out, and make on their own.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">But all this love for Tearaway's effective use of the Vita could have been pretty easily undermined. Tearaway is a platformer from Media Molecule, and if you're like me, that might make you inclined to give the game a worrisome look. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/littlebigplanet/3025-1242/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1242\">LittleBigPlanet</a> was charming as hell, but a good platformer it was not. I couldn't stand the physics, even if I was enthralled by the aesthetic and soundtrack. Tearaway does not suffer the same fate. That's not accomplished by trying to compete with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>, but embracing the quirk and charm that define Media Molecule's sense of humor, and imbuing that into the game design.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">There is actually very little platforming involved with Tearaway, and the few times where the levels demand precision is when the game's at its weakest. You have some control over the camera with the right stick, but it's not consistent, and the instances where you can't seem to spin it around always felt like the points where the game is asking you to bop from one point to the next. The most frustrating moments in Tearaway are when the jumps look remarkably simple, and the camera won't let you pull it off.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2292930-screenshot_05.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2292930\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2292930-screenshot_05.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2292930\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2292930-screenshot_05.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2292930-screenshot_05.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Unlike other games, Tearaway doesn't ignore your presence.

Tearaway leans on our ingrained desire to poke and prod at the worlds created for us, and find what has been hidden away. It's slightly unfair for <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-3d-world/3030-42931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42931\">Super Mario 3D World</a> to have been released on the same day as Tearaway, a game that empitomizes the balance between encouraging players to explore and making sure the exploration itself is fun, not just the reward of a dancing collectible. In this, Tearaway works as often as it doesn't, with the game struggling to decide whether its world is compelling enough to entice players to look around, or whether collectibles are needed to make them stick around. Tearaway works best when its collectibles are tied to making use of the Vita itself in unique ways, particularly the blank papercraft models littered through each stage. To fill the papercraft in, players must point their camera and usher them into the world, and each time is as satisfying as the last. Even though they are, by definition, a collectible, it doesn't feel that way. Instead, it's about completing this lovely, living world surrounding you. It's far less fun when you're missing one, solitary piece of confetti, and it's seemingly nowhere to be found. That just feels like work.</p><p style=\"\">Tearaway does not last very long. We're talking five or six hours at most. But take a good look; it's worth it. The view is spectacular, and over at just the right time. Games can outstay their welcome, and the best leave us wanting more, wishing to see one more stage. Tearway is a video game that happens to be <em>about</em> video games, as well. It's about you, the player, and it's about the people who make them, too. To say much more would unravel the touching, passionate message behind Tearaway, especially its remarkable ending, but the game leaves you in the same way it greets you: with a smile.</p>", "deck": "Media Molecule makes a strong case for the Vita, with a deeply charming game that thoughtfully uses everything the hardware has to offer.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-615/", "platforms": "PlayStation Vita", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39356/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tearaway/3030-39356/", "id": 39356, "name": "Tearaway"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-11-27 16:25:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-126653/", "id": 126653, "name": "Tearaway"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}]
