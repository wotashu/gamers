Hurricane's not quite a sequel, since it's developed by an entirely new crew, but it's a faithful update to the Hydro Thunder mechanics. With pretty good online play for up to eight racers and eight tracks to choose from, Hurricane's racing is a lot of fun.<br/> <br/> Racing in Hydro Thunder Hurricane is all about learning the tracks to figure out where the best shortcuts are and collecting canisters of boost that keep you moving fast. You typically don't get much boost from one item, though, so you're sort of always on the hunt for more. All the while, you're racing against other boats that are trying to do the same thing, which usually means you're bumping each other out of the way at all times. It also means that everyone who wants to win is using one of the three expert class boats, which are faster than all the rest. Maybe the online would have benefitted from a class-lock option to force everyone into similarly built vehicles, but as long as you don't mind seeing six of the eight players in your race piloting \"Rad Hazard\" every single time, it's not a big deal. However, it does mean that you'll need to learn the tracks offline before you even think about winning an online race in the squirrelly expert boats.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406146-summerofarcademontage_esrb_et_720p30_st_6300kbps_29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406146\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406146-summerofarcademontage_esrb_et_720p30_st_6300kbps_29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406146\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1406146-summerofarcademontage_esrb_et_720p30_st_6300kbps_29.jpg\"></a><figcaption> From realistic-looking spots like this one to Area 51, you'll experience a variety of locations across the eight tracks.</figcaption></figure>     Offline, you can race against artificially intelligent boats on those same eight tracks. Racing the AI isn't nearly as exciting as squaring off against real people, since the AI boats aren't especially aggressive. You just start at the back of a pack of 16 and need to work your way to the front before the race ends. There are also extra events that put you on the water by yourself and have to race through rings or avoid exploding barrels for online leaderboard times. Lastly, there's a championship mode that puts all of the single-player events together in multi-race chunks. I found the ring master and barrel-dodging gauntlet events to be extremely boring. Offline, you'll need to grind out credits to unlock boats, tracks, and events. Online, everything except the different skins for your boats are available immediately, so the unlock progression is a little needless. That said, it's weak that you have to place in the top three spots to earn any credits at all online. If the rise of persistent first-person shooting has taught us anything, it's that you should probably progress a little bit just for putting in the time.<br/> <br/> Visually, Hydro Thunder Hurricane approximates the look of the original game. It's bright and colorful, the waves whip around, and there are lots of things going on in the background, like stealth bombers taking off or a giant <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1543\" href=\"/viking/3015-1543/\" slug=\"viking\">viking</a> doing... whatever it is that giant vikings do when they see a tiny boat race.<br/> <br/> While I found most of the single-player modes to be a bit of a drag and the way things get unlocked for single-player could have been handled a bit more smoothly, the online multiplayer is what earns Hydro Thunder Hurricane its keep. It's a fast-moving and thrilling online race that offers just enough content to fit with its downloadable-sized pricing.", "deck": "Look past the dull single-player modes and get online if you want to have a great time racing boats.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-303/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30492/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/hydro-thunder-hurricane/3030-30492/", "id": 30492, "name": "Hydro Thunder Hurricane"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-07-30 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-102249/", "id": 102249, "name": "Hydro Thunder Hurricane"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty-review/1900-304/", "description": "<p style=\"\"> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454498-sc2_2010_07_31_13_53_19_51.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454498\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454498-sc2_2010_07_31_13_53_19_51.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454498\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454498-sc2_2010_07_31_13_53_19_51.png\"></a><figcaption> If Jim Raynor can't get it done, no one can.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Twelve years is a long time to wait for a sequel, even a sequel to one of the best games ever made. <a href=\"/blizzard-entertainment/3010-1088/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1088\"> Blizzard </a>itself has poked fun at <a href=\"/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/3030-20674/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\"> StarCraft II</a>'s long gestation with its frequent refrain of \"Hell, it's about time,\" and while it <i>is </i>in fact about time, it was also completely worth the wait. The <a href=\"/terran/3015-976/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-976\"> Terran</a>-focused Wings of Liberty is so good on all counts that it's going to be really tough to wait for the second and third <a href=\"/zerg/3015-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-361\"> Zerg</a>- and <a href=\"/protoss/3015-373/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-373\"> Protoss</a>-focused chapters of the story, and given Blizzard's penchant for taking its sweet time making games, that might be a long wait. It's a good thing the competitive part of StarCraft II is so great that a lot of players will still be busy battling it out online not just until those follow-ups arrive, but even long after they've come and gone. I know I will be.</p><p style=\"\">While Blizzard has revisited real-time strategy once since 1998 with <a href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\"> Warcraft III</a>--and <a href=\"/gas-powered-games/3010-1579/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1579\"> plenty </a>of <a href=\"/ea-los-angeles/3010-1382/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1382\"> other </a><a href=\"/relic-entertainment/3010-1804/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1804\"> developers </a>have refined and evolved the genre in their own ways--the elegant three-way balance of the original <a href=\"/starcraft/3030-13062/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13062\"> StarCraft </a>has remained an institution, so close to perfection that more than a decade later it's still famously practiced as a national pastime in some parts of the world. That's why StarCraft II hews to the same factions and gameplay formula as its vaunted predecessor, and why Blizzard couldn't, and shouldn't, have changed the fundamental core of what this game is. The developers of the new <a href=\"/nba-jam/3030-29664/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29664\"> NBA Jam</a> aren't going to add an extra hoop to their sequel just for the sake of making changes. If there's ever another <a href=\"/quake/3030-8015/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8015\"> Quake</a>, I'm pretty sure you'll play it in first-person with a gun protruding out of the bottom of the screen. Some games, especially intensely competitive ones, are so brilliantly put-together that their inner workings are basically etched in stone. StarCraft is one of them.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454489-sc2_2010_07_31_13_19_34_34.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454489\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454489-sc2_2010_07_31_13_19_34_34.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454489\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454489-sc2_2010_07_31_13_19_34_34.png\"></a><figcaption> Some of the story missions are downright epic.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All that is to say that in StarCraft II, you still place unit-producing buildings around a town hall, extract minerals and <a href=\"/vespene-gas/3055-444/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-444\"> vespene gas</a> with worker units, and manage multiple production queues simultaneously to win battles. Making more units than the other guy, and using them more deftly than him, remain the two concepts key to achieving victory. That framework is carried over as you remember it from the first game. It's in each race's roster of units and the game's streamlined interface that you'll find the years' worth of improvements you'd expect. There are as many new units as old ones, and even the old ones largely behave in very new ways, and yet that sublime three-way balance is still there. I love the Protoss' giant laser-spewing <i>War of the Worlds</i> walkers the <a href=\"/colossus/3015-5797/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5797\"> colossi</a> and the Zerg's incredibly annoying flying siege unit the <a href=\"/brood-lord/3015-5783/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5783\">brood lord</a>, and players will be debating the finer points of utilizing these and every other unit in the game for years. There are also plenty of obscure-sounding minor changes to the way the game plays--abilities that now cast unaided, the ability to group production buildings, automation in things like resource-mining--that add up to a major improvement in the way the game plays. StarCraft II is still StarCraft, yes, but modernized in ways that make it feel current and will keep it viable for years to come.</p><p style=\"\">But hold on a second. If you're not some kind of crazed StarCraft grognard who knows what terms like \"8 pool\" and \"natural\" mean, all this multiplayer gobbledygook might sound inapplicable (if not downright nonsensical) to you. For you, there's Wings of Liberty's story-driven campaign, which I submit is both accessible and engrossing enough that anyone can enjoy it. It's mostly about the plight of downtrodden hero <a href=\"/jim-raynor/3005-230/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-230\"> James Raynor</a> and his ragtag group of rebels, who are still fighting against the human tyrant they unwittingly helped install to power in the first game. Of course, the fallen Terran operative-turned-horrendous Zerg queen <a href=\"/sarah-kerrigan/3005-97/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-97\"> Kerrigan </a>gets involved, Raynor's Protoss ally <a href=\"/zeratul/3005-701/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-701\"> Zeratul </a>shows up with an ancient prophecy, and the next thing you know the fate of creation is in jeopardy. Although this is only the first act of a three-part story, you're left with enough closure to feel satisfied--as well as enough loose ends to make you <i>really </i>wish the next game were already here. The events in Wings of Liberty are momentous enough to completely change the landscape of the series' fiction, and I have no idea how Blizzard intends to continue the story arc. But the storytelling here is good enough that I can't wait to find out.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454490-sc2_2010_07_31_13_20_42_95.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454490\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454490-sc2_2010_07_31_13_20_42_95.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454490\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454490-sc2_2010_07_31_13_20_42_95.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454490-sc2_2010_07_31_13_20_42_95.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Getting to know your crew goes a long way toward fleshing out the story.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The first StarCraft was split into three short campaigns, each with a handful of missions focusing on one faction, so the outcry was understandable when Blizzard said this game would focus only on the Terrans. But the quality and depth of this campaign bears out that decision; the focus on one faction lets the writers and the designers go far deeper with the characters, the story, and the gameplay mechanics than they ever could have while juggling three factions in one product. In that first game, the objectives rarely got more complex than \"destroy the enemy's base to win\" or \"survive and protect this special unit until the timer runs out,\" and the story played out only in generic mission briefings, mid-mission voiceover, and infrequent CG cutscenes. In that light, Blizzard has absolutely outdone itself with this game's far longer campaign that contains nearly 30 missions, all of them entirely unique. Every one has individualized, Terran-specific mechanics built into it so you're literally never doing the same thing twice and you're always doing something engaging.</p><p style=\"\">One of them has you attempting to pick up an artifact on a planet being ravaged by a sun that's about to go nova; you're literally fleeing from a wall of fire while you're fighting the enemy, moving your base as you go. Another has you racing to grab minerals faster than a competing faction in order to buy out a mercenary's contract, so she'll help you and not them. (Spending that cash to fight the other faction and slow down your own progress is, of course, a tactical risk.) There's a zombie-style holdout with a day/night cycle where hordes of Zerg-infested humans rush your central position after the sun sets. You rob trains in one mission. I could sit here all day describing unique mission scenarios, but let it suffice that they keep things consistently interesting. It doesn't hurt that there's a shocking number of units and art assets unique to the campaign that you'll never see in multiplayer. It makes the campaign feel shiny and new, all the way through.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454494-sc2_2010_07_31_13_22_40_26.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454494\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454494-sc2_2010_07_31_13_22_40_26.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454494\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454494-sc2_2010_07_31_13_22_40_26.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454494-sc2_2010_07_31_13_22_40_26.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption> This short Protoss campaign makes for a nice diversion from the Terran action.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The stuff you do between missions is great, too. You roam around Raynor's ship the Hyperion, chatting with the misfits you've brought to your cause, and I think this is where the focus on a single faction really pays off. There's more here--more depth of character, more believable pathos, more surprise twists--than I honestly expected out of the story. Raynor's a tortured guy, and that comes across in frequent real-time cinematics that are interspersed between each mission. This is the StarCraft universe seen from a close-up view you never got during the breakneck pace of the first game, from barroom fights with Raynor's armored ex-con buddy <a href=\"/tychus-findlay/3005-2439/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2439\"> Tychus </a>to news reports spewing <a href=\"/arcturus-mengsk/3005-2137/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2137\"> Emperor Mengsk</a>'s propaganda. Blizzard's ludicrously detailed CG cinematics also pop up now and again, with one particularly poignant flashback to the events of the first game that really stuck with me (and, curiously, made me wish <a href=\"/starcraft-ghost/3030-21221/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21221\"> StarCraft Ghost</a> was still in production). The world that's filled in <i>around </i>the missions feels more fully realized than you'd expect from a real-time strategy game like this. StarCraft may not be the most original piece of fiction ever, but it's sure a lot of fun to watch it play out.</p><p style=\"\">This downtime between missions also gives you the chance to customize your campaign experience, through a huge number of possible persistent upgrades. Every unit you deploy has a couple of specific bonuses you can purchase that makes them tougher or more capable in a fight, and there are also two research trees you fund with Zerg and Protoss samples collected during missions. Every tier of these trees offers two really significant bonuses, but you can only choose one of them, so you're always making tradeoffs that affect how your strategies in subsequent missions will play out. Do you want access to a massive transport that can move your entire army around the map, or a robotic panther with an electrical area of effect attack? Do you want a building that can mind-control any Zerg unit, or another one that dramatically slows down <i>all </i>Zerg units? It's a great way to give you an extra level of control over your strategy, and it makes you feel like you're really building up a rough-and-ready army as you gallivant around the galaxy. That's even reflected in the window dressing as you move through the Hyperion; the neat view of the ship's huge hangar that fills up with new additions to your forces as you acquire them, and gives you a look out the window at the planet you're currently orbiting, is a nice touch.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454499-sc2_2010_07_31_13_54_08_21.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454499\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454499-sc2_2010_07_31_13_54_08_21.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454499\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454499-sc2_2010_07_31_13_54_08_21.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454499-sc2_2010_07_31_13_54_08_21.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Blizzard has really amped up its cinematic storytelling here.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">With its wide range of difficulty levels, Wings of Liberty's campaign is accessible to just about anyone. The multiplayer, by its nature, is less so. But the newly redesigned <a href=\"/battlenet/3015-2077/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2077\"> Battle.net</a> service makes a valiant effort to ease new players into what's admittedly a very complex game. There's a really useful series of tough tiered challenge levels that teach you the basics on a per-faction basis, from which units counter which other units to how to micromanage your troops and how to rely on hotkeys to streamline your game. You can play AI opponents on multiple difficulty levels and with friends, to practice and learn before you get online. And once you do, you get 50 unranked matches that don't go on your permanent record in which to practice against other random players. Once you're ready to play for real, there's an elaborate five-tier league system that matches you to players of similar skill, based on your performance in five placement matches.</p><p style=\"\">Depending on how those random matches go, you might place a little too high or too low on the ladder before your subsequent performance equalizes and you settle into the appropriate level. You may lose at first, but that's how you learn. StarCraft II is such an intricate game that the potential for further developing your skills is almost endless, and with a little time the ladder system will put you in the mix with others who are working on a similar skill level. The days of <a href=\"/starcraft-brood-war/3030-5415/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5415\"> Brood War</a>'s Wild West online play are pretty much over. StarCraft II is a sometimes unforgiving but immensely rewarding online experience, and I think the new Battle.net helps make it more the latter than the former.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454504-sc2_2010_07_31_13_17_31_74.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454504\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1454504-sc2_2010_07_31_13_17_31_74.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1454504\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454504-sc2_2010_07_31_13_17_31_74.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1454504-sc2_2010_07_31_13_17_31_74.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption> All the new Battle.net features make it easy to track stats and get games going.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That tiered matchmaking system is the critical piece of the online puzzle, but all the social features wrapped around it are also incredibly well integrated. Your friends list is accessible at any time and you can even pop up little IM-style chat windows with any other player while you're in the middle of a campaign or multiplayer game. (Though, if you're playing multiplayer, what are you doing chatting?) The game has a non-invasive Facebook Connect feature that lets you easily get people you know onto your friends list, and once they're on the list, it's easy to get people into parties and start multiplayer matches. There's a shocking amount of data available through the profile view, showing everything from which of the game's dozens of achievements a player has earned to intensive breakdowns of every online match they've ever played. I'm talking about timecoded build orders, detailed economy graphs, the works--more data than you'd ever want to see, really, unless you're the sort of person who's worried about streamlining your openers or increasing your \"actions per minute.\" But if you <i>are </i>that person, this sort of thing is invaluable.

Actually, with its kooky, grind-heavy design, I don't know that I'd recommend that anyone buy <a data-ref-id=\"3010-87\" href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" slug=\"konami-corporation\">Konami</a>'s latest downloadable <a data-ref-id=\"3025-86\" href=\"/castlevania/3025-86/\" slug=\"castlevania\">Castlevania</a> game, but the game's definitely built to be played as a group.<br/> <br/>Unlike traditional Castlevania games, there's no meaningful story element to Castlevania HD, and you aren't really exploring a large, singular castle. Instead, the game is broken up into six different chapters, each with its own map and boss. Also, each chapter comes with a time limit. So you're not expected to linger around in any one part of the game. In fact, you should probably get moving, even if you're playing alone, because nothing stops the clock. You can't pause the game at all. It's one of those kinds of games.<br/> <br/> When you first start hacking away at a chapter, you'll probably be a little underpowered. That's because a lot of the game revolves around finding better gear or, depending on which of the five protagonists you decide to use, repeatedly using your attacks to increase their power. Those power increases aren't explicitly stated, and the game only lets you swap gear when you're at specific points on the map, making the whole system a bit more obfuscated than it probably should be. Maybe a more standard leveling system that gives you XP for kills would have been easier to follow.<br/> <br/> The game allows up to six players to play, and there are some paths on each map that can only be taken if the players are working together, like switches or platforms that turn off flames or otherwise open doors that help everyone get to the boss fight faster. But since a big part of the game is hunting down more interesting equipment--and it feels like better equipment shows up in multiplayer games--you're better off scouring the four corners of each map before triggering the boss fight to see if you can find anything worthwhile. I'd say around 95% of the stuff I find is essentially vendor trash, though the stores don't sell good enough items to make your gold worth saving. It's like the game is driven by loot lust, but almost all of the loot is totally uninteresting.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31838/1457156-997663_20100706_screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1457156\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31838/1457156-997663_20100706_screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1457156\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31838/1457156-997663_20100706_screen005.jpg\"></a><figcaption> It's a six-player game with five selectable characters.</figcaption></figure>     At least the game has a specific look to it. Though it abbreviates to \"Castlevania HD,\" it's hard to call Harmony of Despair a \"high-definition\" game. The characters look like they right out of the various <a data-ref-id=\"3045-52\" href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" slug=\"nintendo-ds\">Nintendo DS</a> Castlevania games, and the game has a deliberately blocky look to it. That's not a bad thing, as it gives all of the visuals a very specific style, but it's hard not to feel like this game was thrown together to make a quick buck with existing assets. As a result, the only amazing thing about the game is its music.<br/> <br/> But you're probably not looking to spend $15 on a soundtrack that you can only hear on your 360. Castlevania: Harmony of Despair has some neat ideas, but a lot of it's hidden behind a bevy of poorly explained menus and user-unfriendly mechanics. The expectation that you'll grind your way through the six chapters over and over again, only to do it all over again in hard mode is kind of ridiculous, and there just isn't enough of a reward there to make all of that grinding feel like anything other than, well, a grind.", "deck": "Harmony of Despair's multiplayer design isn't fleshed out well enough to make you forget about the grind.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-305/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31137/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/castlevania-harmony-of-despair/3030-31137/", "id": 31137, "name": "Castlevania: Harmony of Despair"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2010-08-05 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101745/", "id": 101745, "name": "Castlevania: Harmony of Despair"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/monday-night-combat-review/1900-306/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1402954-tr_mondaynightcombat_061410_700_23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1402954\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1402954-tr_mondaynightcombat_061410_700_23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1402954\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1402954-tr_mondaynightcombat_061410_700_23.jpg\"></a><figcaption> So many classes, so few robots to kill with them.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30185\" href=\"/blacklight-tango-down/3030-30185/\" slug=\"blacklight-tango-down\">Blacklight: Tango Down</a> recently attempted to bring the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> style of team-based multiplayer action to Xbox Live in an inexpensive, small-scale package, but for my money, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29806\" href=\"/monday-night-combat/3030-29806/\" slug=\"monday-night-combat\">Monday Night Combat</a> is the low-priced multiplayer game to beat. To be fair, it wasn't my money--the game's developer provided us with review access--but for $15, there's a great degree of depth and variety in Monday Night Combat that's really satisfying to wrap your head around.<br/> <br/> The easy shorthand for this game is \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-18162\" href=\"/team-fortress-2/3030-18162/\" slug=\"team-fortress-2\">Team Fortress 2</a> meets <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OzWIFX8M-Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">Defense of the Ancients</a>,\" the sort of lazy description I'd normally shy away from if it weren't so damn accurate. It's got the exaggerated art style and broad mix of specialized classes from the former, and the battlefield layout and gameplay flow of the latter. Turns out, those are in fact two multiplayer tastes that taste grea... well, let's say the developer has done a great job of integrating those two halves into a cohesive whole.<br/> <br/> As you might guess from the name, Monday Night Combat is shot through with the feel of a futuristic death sport, and the main competitive mode, Crossfire, is set up in a six-on-six format. Each team has a goal called the moneyball to defend back at their base, with a bunch of nodes scattered around it where you can cash in money you pick up to build turrets that shoot <a data-ref-id=\"3055-140\" href=\"/laser/3055-140/\" slug=\"laser\">lasers</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-713\" href=\"/rocket/3055-713/\" slug=\"rocket\">rockets</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-899\" href=\"/mortar/3055-899/\" slug=\"mortar\">mortars</a>, or enemy-slowing <a data-ref-id=\"3055-906\" href=\"/ice-beam/3055-906/\" slug=\"ice-beam\">freeze rays</a>. You can also spend that money on upgrades for your own character, so there's a constant balancing act between helping out your team's defenses and boosting your own combat prowess. Both tactics pay off in different ways; the challenge is mostly in knowing when it's best to use which one.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1402983-tr_mondaynightcombat_061410_700_51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1402983\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1402983-tr_mondaynightcombat_061410_700_51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1402983\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1402983-tr_mondaynightcombat_061410_700_51.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Knowing when and how to upgrade your abilities is a big part of the strategy.</figcaption></figure>     Like DOTA, you've got an endless supply of AI-controlled robots spawning in your base and marching toward your enemy's--and they have the same thing going on over on the other side of the map. Only these robots can bring down the shields on the moneyball and allow you to attack it directly, so every match starts with the two waves of robots clashing in the middle of the map and then the line of battle moving toward one base or the other depending on the particulars of the two teams' strategies. In addition to turrets and your own abilities, you can spend your cash to generate additional waves of robots, which is a good way to overwhelm the enemy through sheer attrition.<br/> <br/> With all these options, it's immensely satisfying to set up workable defenses, mix your classes properly, work together, and progressively push the line of conflict forward. Conversely it's frustrating as hell when your team doesn't know what it's doing and everyone runs around aimlessly while a coordinated enemy steamrolls right over you. In short, the game is subject to the same strict requirement to know what the hell you're doing as every other team-based game, but you can't really hold that against the game itself. It has a high learning curve, but there are really extensive video and text tutorials to ramp you up quickly.<br/> <br/> There are also a lot of options in how you play, with six classes that fall into standard team-based archetypes. Here, let me list them and let's see if you can tell roughly what role they're supposed to fill. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3294\" href=\"/assault/3015-3294/\" slug=\"assault\">Assault</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-487\" href=\"/sniper/3005-487/\" slug=\"sniper\">sniper</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2441\" href=\"/gunner/3015-2441/\" slug=\"gunner\">gunner</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1321\" href=\"/assassin/3015-1321/\" slug=\"assassin\">assassin</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-485\" href=\"/engineer/3005-485/\" slug=\"engineer\">support</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-438\" href=\"/tank/3015-438/\" slug=\"tank\">tank</a>. Self-explanatory, right? Each class has two weapons and several neat abilities: the support can heal teammates and call down airstrikes, the assassin can dash and cloak for stealth kills, the gunner can do a ground-pound slam attack and turn himself into a living turret. A big part of successful strategy is getting everyone to play their class well and use their abilities to complement each other and form a united front.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88053/1318708-mnc_paxeast06_1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1318708\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88053/1318708-mnc_paxeast06_1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1318708\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/88053/1318708-mnc_paxeast06_1280.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/88053/1318708-mnc_paxeast06_1280.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dude, you might want to watch that moneyball...</figcaption></figure>     If you want a break from Crossfire, there's also the Blitz mode, which is basically Crossfire with only one team. It's tower defense. You and up to three others hold off wave after wave of robots spawning from different locations by building turrets, upgrading your abilities, and scrambling frantically. There are increasing difficulty levels of Blitz to go through, and it feels different enough from Crossfire to warrant its status as a separate mode. I had a ton of fun with Blitz, other than one distinctly bug-like instance where a particular round never seemed to end, spewing so many robots that the game bogged down until it was unplayable.<br/> <br/> That wasn't the only questionable spot I ran into. As good as the core concepts in Monday Night Combat are, this is at times a rough-looking game. The frame rate can dip to almost unmanageable levels when there's too much going on. There are some weird animation bugs; character models who catch on fire or have angels circling their heads during a stun tend to retain those graphical effects long after the debuffs themselves have expired. And the general user experience feels a bit shoddy, with some design elements that pop from low to high resolution when you change menus, some fonts that don't fit very well in their containers, and the like. It's nothing that makes the game less fun overall, but it does give the impression that the game was built fairly quickly by a small team, which it was.<br/> <br/> That's also Monday Night Combat's strength, though; it's lean, cheap, and focused, but it still offers a great multiplayer formula that feels like more than its component parts. Get a few friends together who are ready to learn the ins and outs of the available classes and tactics, and there's enough depth here to keep you playing for a good long while after you've gotten your $15 worth.", "deck": "For $15, there's an awful lot of varied, satisfying multiplayer action in here.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-306/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29806/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/monday-night-combat/3030-29806/", "id": 29806, "name": "Monday Night Combat"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-08-13 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-102247/", "id": 102247, "name": "Monday Night Combat"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/kane-lynch-2-dog-days-review/1900-307/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1440527-21_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1440527\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1440527-21_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1440527\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1440527-21_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_26.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Kane's calling this his last job.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5440\" href=\"/adam-kane-marcus/3005-5440/\" slug=\"adam-kane-marcus\">Kane</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6224\" href=\"/james-lynch/3005-6224/\" slug=\"james-lynch\">Lynch</a>'s return to action sees the duo placed in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2713\" href=\"/shanghai/3035-2713/\" slug=\"shanghai\">Shanghai</a>, but more importantly it sees the criminal duo placed in a better third-person shooter than 2007's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19874\" href=\"/kane-lynch-dead-men/3030-19874/\" slug=\"kane-lynch-dead-men\">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men</a>. But the more intense and satisfying action of the sequel doesn't last. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26394\" href=\"/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/3030-26394/\" slug=\"kane-lynch-2-dog-days\">Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days</a> suffers from a general lack of content across all of its modes. It also has a crazy and unique visual style that really makes the game worth seeing, but its length (and some seemingly rare but decidedly crippling issues in the 360 version) makes the game's $60 price tag feel high.<br/> <br/> Dog Days puts Lynch and Kane in Shanghai. They haven't exactly remained close since the events of the first game, but when Lynch's Chinese connection--OK, he's actually a British guy named Glazer--needs someone to help out on a caper, Lynch gets Kane involved. As you might expect, the deal goes sideways almost immediately, pitting Shanghai's biggest crime boss against Kane and Lynch, forcing them to spend the entire game trying to get the hell out of China. The plot is quite thin, though there's some pretty good dialogue interspersed here and there. There's a bit of a \"less is more\" approach here, because every time the action stops, something incredibly messed up happens, from a naked woman getting gunned down by stray bullets to a torture scene that leaves the two protagonists bloody and, hey, wait, they're <i>also</i> naked.<br/> <br/> The gameplay in Dog Days is fine, but you've played this game before. This is a cover-based third-person shooter with very few frills. You hit a button to get into cover, back away to get out, and you'll use the left trigger to pop out and the right trigger to shoot. You'll use a variety of weapons, including some of the most effective <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotguns</a> I've seen in a very long time. Seriously, the shotguns in Kane &amp; Lynch 2 feel like they reach out and touch enemies that would be too far away for most other in-game shotguns. But aside from the occasional gas can or other explosive object that you can throw out at your enemies and shoot, all of the weapons are guns. Without <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenades</a>, it's tough for the enemies to flush you out of your position, and though they'll occasionally try to flank you, it's not especially difficult to keep them at bay. As a result, the game usually only gets difficult if you're out of patience and trying to rush ahead.<br/> <br/> If you're trying to get the most out of the game, I'd actually advise you against rushing ahead, because the game is already short enough as it is. It took me a little under four hours to get through the story mode. You can always play the game cooperatively, but the co-op mode doesn't support any kind of jump-in or jump-out play. You'll have to create a lobby and wait for a player to join or invite a friend. It all feels a little dated, design-wise. Luckily, the rest of the multiplayer is more interesting.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1440508-5_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1440508\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1440508-5_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1440508\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1440508-5_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_11.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Fragile Alliance returns in the sequel with some good new variants. </figcaption></figure>     Fragile Alliance returns from the first game, and it's more effective here because, unlike the first game, the core shooting and player movement in K&amp;L2 is actually fun. It's a unique mix of cooperative and competitive play, as all the players start on one team of criminals, attempting to take down a big score and escape within four minutes or so. The catch is that, at any point, a player can gun down someone on his team and turn traitor, which means he won't split the money he's carrying with anyone else--if he can make it out alive, that is. Regular players that die respawn as cops, adding another human element to the criminals' opposition. The problem with all this is that there are only six maps (unless you unlock an extra map or two via pre-order codes) and running them over and over gets old. The enemies usually appear in the same areas every single time, and there are realistically only one or two places where it makes sense for a player to turn traitor, so once you've grown to expect those, it's fairly similar every time. But some additional modes help change things up.<br/> <br/> Cops &amp; Robbers is a mode that allows players to respawn as they fight back and forth over sacks of loot. It's a decent diversion, but the Undercover Cop mode is probably the best of the lot. Here, Fragile Alliance is played as usual, but one player is secretly told that he's the cop. And it's up to that player to ensure that none of the other criminals escape. To facilitate this, the cop isn't flagged as a traitor when he shoots the criminals. So the goal is to stealthily take down the criminals, one at a time. It's pretty thrilling and tough, but not impossible, to pull off.<br/> <br/> While it's a bit lacking on the content side, the visual style of Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days is really amazing. The whole game looks like it's being filmed on a busted-up cell phone, with plenty of MPEG compression artifacts, color separation, streaky lighting, and so on. Watching the frame rate deliberately take a dive during huge explosions is especially cool. Also, the game's camera lopes and swings around dramatically, especially when you run. While it can be enough to make spectators a bit nauseous, I didn't have any trouble with it when I was actually at the controls. If you can't deal with it, a \"Steadycam\" setting in the options lets you calm down the camera movement, but not the other visual tricks.

It seems that some sort of profile or save game-related issue causes the game to completely seize up for a few seconds when you kill someone, often with a shotgun or via the game's human shield mechanic. I'm no QA guy, so I won't try to speculate too much about what's going on, and perhaps it's not the sort of thing that will happen to every single Xbox 360 owner, but it happened here on multiple machines. We've got footage of it occurring in our video review. It's pretty terrible. If you're looking at buying the Xbox 360 version of the game, you might want to wait for a patch or two. No such issues occurred in the PlayStation 3 version of the game.<br/> <br/> Kane &amp; Lynch 2's visual style really sets it apart in ways that its standard take-cover action can't. It'd be a really cool game that would actually be pretty easy to recommend if there were a little more to it. While there are definitely aspects of the game that are very much worth seeing, the game's lack of content (and potentially severe Xbox 360 issue) make it tough to recommend as a full-priced purchase.", "deck": "Kane and Lynch's trek through Shanghai's underworld is astoundingly brief, leaving you just enough time to get a feel for the game's great visual style, but not much else.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-307/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26394/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/3030-26394/", "id": 26394, "name": "Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-08-17 06:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-91461/", "id": 91461, "name": "Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/madden-nfl-11-review/1900-308/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Over the course of the last decade, sports games--with EA's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\" slug=\"madden-nfl\">     Madden</a>  series chief among them--have begun to resemble a massive game of Jenga, ever-teetering on the brink of collapsing. With each passing year, the core concept of the  game remains the same: play sports. But in order to incentivize the  package being sold each year as new, developers have endlessly stacked  new modes atop others, removed various things and replaced them with  tweaked versions of those same things, and effectively turned each new  game into an ever-evolving, increasingly unstable Frankenstein's monster of complicated  features, new graphical/animation engines, haphazardly licensed  soundtracks, and unwieldy \"extra\" content designed to wring \"extra\"  money from your wallet.<br/> <br/>All of this for games that are, by and large, becoming less and less  accessible to a mass-market audience as the years pass. More complex  control schemes, insane levels of statistical number-crunching, and  labyrinthine interfaces that seem concocted by sports-obsessed mental  patients have more or less robbed Madden of any real casual appeal. Why  go online when you know you're going to get obliterated by some cast-off  from the Madden Challenge who picks the Lions just because he's out to  screw with you? In <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29744\" href=\"/madden-nfl-11/3030-29744/\" slug=\"madden-nfl-11\">    Madden NFL 11</a>, it feels like EA Sports might finally  have realized all of this. Make no mistake, this is still a crazy-deep  game of football with more features than you'll probably ever know what  to do with (and seemingly than even the <i>developers</i> knew what to do  with), but most of the big changes and new features seem geared  specifically toward making the experience of getting into Madden a  simpler, more accessible experience.<br/> <br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15164/1426043-10.8.184.41_image19_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1426043\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15164/1426043-10.8.184.41_image19_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1426043\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15164/1426043-10.8.184.41_image19_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\"></a><figcaption> An improved running game has also led to a slightly over-powered running game, in some cases.</figcaption></figure>     By most measures, these attempts are successful. I certainly had an  easy time getting into the game, and I haven't even played a Madden game  in over three years. On the field, things feel a bit more  straightforward. What EA is calling a \"Locomotion\" animation system has  added an element of momentum to the game. The turbo button of old is  gone, and now the speed of your runner has everything to do with... well,  the <i>speed of your runner</i>. Likewise with power. If you've got a big,  honking back going through a line, give him a little head of steam, and  he'll go straight up Juggernaut. Additionally, several runner moves have  been mapped to the control sticks, giving you a little more freedom of  movement as you navigate would-be tacklers and blockers. By and large  this new system feels good, though at times the running game does seem a  little on the absurd side. This year's game features more  behind-the-line stuffs and 35-yard breaks than any I've seen in a good,  long while. Basically, it just feels like the middle-ground isn't really  there. You're either a beast, or a burden, it seems. <br/> <br/>The other big change on the field is the new GameFlow system. Unless  you're one of the Madden hardcore (and, admittedly, there are many of  you) chances are that at least at once in your Madden-playing career, you have found sifting through playbooks during the course of the game  to be a slightly daunting and unpleasant task. To alleviate this,  GameFlow essentially takes the necessity of calling plays out of your  hands. By pressing a single button, the \"coordinators\" on the sidelines  will call offensive and defensive schemes for you, and it's simply your  job to execute. Ideally, these coordinators are taking plays from a book  of your own design. Via the game's menus, you can create a whole custom  playbook, with specific plays weighted for relevancy in specific  situations. So, you know, on third and long, you would hopefully have a  number of good pass plays at your disposal, versus 1st and goal, where you might want to send the running back in. <br/> <br/>GameFlow is one of those ideas that probably should have come around  years ago. It's a seemingly minor alteration to the formula that  actually does wonders for making the pace of the game suit other players  beyond the ones who thrive on endless tweaking and adjusting. That  said, this is one of those features that will also probably be better  next year. Despite spending a good hour or so customizing a  playbook, I still found that on most teams, I ended up with a fairly  pass-happy offense, even in situations where I primarily selected  running plays to be the order of the day. On the flip side, I had a  coordinator call a running draw play on 3rd and long at least three  times for inexplicable reasons. Fortunately, if you hate this mode  altogether, you can still just call plays the old fashioned way.<br/> <br/>Things on the field generally look and feel a lot better than in  years past, as well. The new animation system has its good qualities to  be sure. There's some goofiness with deflected balls and awkward  animations with dropped passes, but mostly the action on the field looks  believable, as it should. Better than any of that, though, is the  addition of Gus Johnson and Chris Collinsworth on the mics in the  commentary booth. Johnson does really solid play-by-play work, and  Collinsworth's delivery and demeanor is as comfortable as any I've heard  in a football game in years. If there's any issue, it's just that the  editing of said commentary sometimes is a little suspect. The way  Johnson overemphasizes Chad Ochocinco's name <i>every single time</i> is a  tad obnoxious, and Collinsworth sometimes finds himself rambling on  about things that didn't actually happen on the field. Still, it's a big  improvement over past games.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/233/1355992-gf4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355992\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.34727272727273\" data-width=\"550\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:34.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/233/1355992-gf4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355992\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/233/1355992-gf4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Setting up your gameplan ahead of time is the ideal way to use the GameFlow feature in-game.</figcaption></figure>     On a last note, one minor-looking change to the on-field action is  actually my favorite. Audibles have been reworked, so that now, instead  of using set audible plays that could be from any formation or package,  the audible menu now presents you with four plays using more or less  the same package you have on the field. This means that you can call  audibles without being supremely obvious about what it is you're up to.  It's one of those seemingly throwaway changes that actually makes the  game a lot better.<br/> <br/>In terms of game modes, Madden 11 is stuffed as full as ever, to the  point where it will probably take you weeks to even realize some of  these features are here. Franchise mode returns in mostly the same form  you've come to know it in, and the online version of it, which debuted  last year, is quite an engaging experience. It's easy enough to join up  with a league full of your friends, and play games with them each week.  Trades, injuries, fantasy drafts, detailed statistics, all of it's  there. Of course, you can also just go online and play the standard  head-to-head action against friends and curse-and-quit-happy strangers,  as per usual, or you can try out the new co-op mode. This lets teams of  up to three players each work together by taking control of specific  squads on the field. Offensively, you can control the quarterback, all  running backs, or all the wide receivers. Defensively, you've got the  defensive line, linebackers and defensive backs.  <br/> <br/>The really cool thing  about this mode is that it takes the pressure off players who are more  interested in simply executing plays versus strategizing them. Only  quarterbacks and linebackers worry about calling plays, so if you prefer  to just handle the running game and worry about sacking the  quarterback, then you can do that. As with all Madden online modes, this  is a mode best played with friends and trusted colleagues, as random  encounters are likely to result in a lot of rage-quitting and ridiculous  behavior on the field. But if you do get a good group of players  together, it can lead to some pretty exciting action on the field, too.<br/> <br/>Of course, make sure you have a new copy of the game if you plan to  do any of this. Otherwise, if you do plan to pick up a used copy on the  cheap, be prepared to pony up 10 bucks to get online. EA has included a serial number with every  new copy of Madden. In order to sign onto the online servers, you'll  need to enter that one-time-use code. If you buy a used copy, you'll  either need to pray that code was never used, or spend some Internet  dollars in order to get yourself a new one. It's kind of messed up, but  again, it really only affects those that troll the used bins. I'm just  not a huge fan of any barriers to entry on games you buy, especially when  it's a barrier to easily the most exciting portion of the entire game.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/233/1354713-pic_eightnew3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1354713\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/233/1354713-pic_eightnew3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1354713\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/233/1354713-pic_eightnew3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/233/1354713-pic_eightnew3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Here is a picture of Tim Tebow, for no other reason than I still find him being a first round pick utterly hilarious.</figcaption></figure>     Less exciting, and frankly rather superfluous, are the remainder of  the game's modes. Superstar mode returns, and is every bit the clunky,  hollow, unimaginative experience that I remember from three years ago.  The Madden Moments feature, which lets you replay big-time plays and  huge comebacks from last season, is a marginal distraction that is  hobbled by the fact that it includes no \"restart\" option anywhere in the  menu. Screw up that fourth down conversion with no timeouts left, and  you'll sit there each and every time as the computer takes a knee for  over a minute and a half. That <i>sucks.</i><br/> <br/>Ultimate Team, which made its debut last year via a patch, has  returned on-disc in Madden 11. This is the mode where you effectively  play football via trading cards. You start with a pack of player cards  filled with scrubs, play matches online or against the computer, and  earn coins to buy new packs of cards, in the hopes of landing a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10983\" href=\"/peyton-manning/3005-10983/\" slug=\"peyton-manning\"> Peyton  Manning</a> or Adrian Petersen. It's kind of a nifty idea, though the way  it's set up isn't altogether compelling. Playing a bunch of games with a  50-something-rated team against even players of similar skill level  usually results in a great deal of folly. Those players suck for a  reason, so playing a bunch of frustrating football in the hopes of your  team eventually becoming less frustrating is not the most exciting  prospect in the world. Then again, you could always just bypass all the  bad football-playing and simply buy coins, using real money, via the  Madden shop. You can buy up to $50 worth at a time! Or, you know, you  could just not bother with this mode.<br/> <br/>That coin-purchasing system is really just the tip of the iceberg in  a game that feels loaded to the point of adver-sploding with marketing  opportunities straight from the bowels of Hell. I'm not just talking  about the usual spate of in-game advertising inherent to all sports  games. I'm not just talking about the abundance of EA- and NFL-related  advertising that pops straight in on the \"what's new\" menu when you  first boot up the game. I'm not just talking about the daily scroll bar  that explains ample opportunities for pre-ordering other EA games at various retailers. I'm not just talking about the lazily  cobbled-together soundtrack that features a wide variety of heavily  edited songs from heavily marketable and wildly incompatible bands. I'm  not just talking about the slightly spine-cringing practice of selling  sponsorships on Xbox 360 achievements. I'm talking about all of these  things, at once, thrown in your face like some kind of marketing hurricane from which none of your senses are ever safe, so long as that  disc is in your console. We've gone from that simple realm of lousy but  harmless in-game ads to being blasted, AA12 shotgun-style by marketers  in games we've already paid $60 for. Does it affect the overall gameplay  experience? Not a whole lot, but that doesn't make the presence of this stuff any less  disgusting.<br/> <br/>What it boils down to with Madden NFL 11, as it generally does with  every iteration of this game that comes out, is whether or not the pieces  that have been reshuffled and restacked atop this year's title make it  worth a new purchase. Straight up, my perspective on this is a bit  skewed, since this is my first Madden in multiple years. I don't feel  quite the fatigue I did from years past when I was playing the game year in and year out, and  with that in mind, I actually plan to continue playing Madden 11 beyond the scope of this review. I'm going to keep playing my  online franchise, I'm going to play co-op games with my friends, I'm  going to keep messing around with my beloved Patriots franchise, and  along the way, I'll probably keep using GameFlow in the process. For  newcomers, it's easy to say that this is the most accessible new entry  in the series in a good, long time, but that really is only in  comparison to previous installments. This is otherwise still every bit the complex, over-stuffed, top-heavy game of football that EA has been  producing since this console generation gained its bearings. That is  either a thing you want, or a thing you don't.

But the more intense and satisfying action of the sequel doesn't last. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26394\" href=\"/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/3030-26394/\" slug=\"kane-lynch-2-dog-days\">Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days</a> suffers from a general lack of content across all of its modes. It also has a crazy and unique visual style that really makes the game worth seeing, but its length (and some seemingly rare but decidedly crippling issues in the 360 version) makes the game's $60 price tag feel high.<br/> <br/>  Dog Days puts Lynch and Kane in Shanghai. They haven't exactly remained close since the events of the first game, but when Lynch's Chinese connection--OK, he's actually a British guy named Glazer--needs someone to help out on a caper, Lynch gets Kane involved. As you might expect, the deal goes sideways almost immediately, pitting Shanghai's biggest crime boss against Kane and Lynch, forcing them to spend the entire game trying to get the hell out of China. The plot is quite thin, though there's some pretty good dialogue interspersed here and there. There's a bit of a \"less is more\" approach here, because every time the action stops, something incredibly messed up happens, from a naked woman getting gunned down by stray bullets to a torture scene that leaves the two protagonists bloody and, hey, wait, they're <i>also</i> naked.<br/> <br/>  The gameplay in Dog Days is fine, but you've played this game before. This is a cover-based third-person shooter with very few frills. You hit a button to get into cover, back away to get out, and you'll use the left trigger to pop out and the right trigger to shoot. You'll use a variety of weapons, including some of the most effective <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotguns</a> I've seen in a very long time. Seriously, the shotguns in Kane &amp; Lynch 2 feel like they reach out and touch enemies that would be too far away for most other in-game shotguns. But aside from the occasional gas can or other explosive object that you can throw out at your enemies and shoot, all of the weapons are guns. Without <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenades</a>, it's tough for the enemies to flush you out of your position, and though they'll occasionally try to flank you, it's not especially difficult to keep them at bay. As a result, the game usually only gets difficult if you're out of patience and trying to rush ahead.<br/> <br/>  If you're trying to get the most out of the game, I'd actually advise you against rushing ahead, because the game is already short enough as it is. It took me a little under four hours to get through the story mode. You can always play the game cooperatively, but the co-op mode doesn't support any kind of jump-in or jump-out play. You'll have to create a lobby and wait for a player to join or invite a friend. It all feels a little dated, design-wise. Luckily, the rest of the multiplayer is more interesting.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1440508-5_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1440508\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1440508-5_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1440508\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1440508-5_kl2_focus_on_the_job_multiplayer_us_11.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Fragile Alliance returns in the sequel with some good new variants. </figcaption></figure>      Fragile Alliance returns from the first game, and it's more effective here because, unlike the first game, the core shooting and player movement in K&amp;L2 is actually fun. It's a unique mix of cooperative and competitive play, as all the players start on one team of criminals, attempting to take down a big score and escape within four minutes or so. The catch is that, at any point, a player can gun down someone on his team and turn traitor, which means he won't split the money he's carrying with anyone else--if he can make it out alive, that is. Regular players that die respawn as cops, adding another human element to the criminals' opposition. The problem with all this is that there are only six maps (unless you unlock an extra map or two via pre-order codes) and running them over and over gets old. The enemies usually appear in the same areas every single time, and there are realistically only one or two places where it makes sense for a player to turn traitor, so once you've grown to expect those, it's fairly similar every time. But some additional modes help change things up.<br/> <br/>  Cops &amp; Robbers is a mode that allows players to respawn as they fight back and forth over sacks of loot. It's a decent diversion, but the Undercover Cop mode is probably the best of the lot. Here, Fragile Alliance is played as usual, but one player is secretly told that he's the cop. And it's up to that player to ensure that none of the other criminals escape. To facilitate this, the cop isn't flagged as a traitor when he shoots the criminals. So the goal is to stealthily take down the criminals, one at a time. It's pretty thrilling and tough, but not impossible, to pull off.<br/> <br/>  While it's a bit lacking on the content side, the visual style of Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days is really amazing. The whole game looks like it's being filmed on a busted-up cell phone, with plenty of MPEG compression artifacts, color separation, streaky lighting, and so on. Watching the frame rate deliberately take a dive during huge explosions is especially cool. Also, the game's camera lopes and swings around dramatically, especially when you run.

It seems that some sort of profile or save game-related issue causes the game to completely seize up for a few seconds when you kill someone, often with a shotgun or via the game's human shield mechanic. I'm no QA guy, so I won't try to speculate too much about what's going on, and perhaps it's not the sort of thing that will happen to every single Xbox 360 owner, but it happened here on multiple machines. We've got footage of it occurring in our video review. It's pretty terrible. If you're looking at buying the Xbox 360 version of the game, you might want to wait for a patch or two. No such issues occurred in the PlayStation 3 version of the game.<br/> <br/>  Kane &amp; Lynch 2's visual style really sets it apart in ways that its standard take-cover action can't. It'd be a really cool game that would actually be pretty easy to recommend if there were a little more to it. While there are definitely aspects of the game that are very much worth seeing, the game's lack of content (and potentially severe Xbox 360 issue) make it tough to recommend as a full-priced purchase.", "deck": "Kane and Lynch's trek through Shanghai's underworld is astoundingly brief, leaving you just enough time to get a feel for the game's great visual style, but not much else.

But Guardian of Light takes the blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and gunplay in a different direction, adopting an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-246\" href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" slug=\"isometric-viewpoint\">isometric perspective</a> and scoring system befitting its downloadable nature. Oddly, the net effect of the old-school perspective shift is a game that feels more fresh and vital than a Tomb Raider game has in a while. It has a few hitches, but overall it's just a terrifically fun, well-paced game.<br/> <br/> The setup here is pure, classic <a data-ref-id=\"3005-195\" href=\"/lara-croft/3005-195/\" slug=\"lara-croft\">Lara Croft</a> business--business that the game chews through with incredible efficiency at the top. There's a magical artifact, there are other, evil treasure hunters out for the loot, and the next thing you know, a diabolical Aztec god has been released back onto the world along with a whole host of demonic minions. After that, well, these tombs aren't going to raid themselves, are they?<br/> <br/> While the game is played from a fixed isometric perspective, it still hits a lot of familiar Tomb Raider beats. It has more of a focus on puzzle-solving and combat than exploration, and it does all of it with a greater emphasis on speed, a point that really benefits the whole package. Everything about the controls feels sharp and responsive, and a dual-stick gunplay system, paired with an awesomely expanding arsenal and a greater focus on crowd control, makes the combat more fun and satisfying than it's arguably ever been in a proper Tomb Raider game.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1409536-23_laracroftandtheguardianoflighttrailer_36.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409536\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1409536-23_laracroftandtheguardianoflighttrailer_36.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409536\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1409536-23_laracroftandtheguardianoflighttrailer_36.jpg\"></a><figcaption>   Some obstacles require you to act quickly and use your abilities in less-than-obvious ways.</figcaption></figure>     One of the hooks in Guardian of Light is that it's largely designed to be played <a data-ref-id=\"3015-108\" href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" slug=\"cooperative-play\">cooperatively</a>, with the second player assuming the role of Totec, that titular Guardian. While both are relatively nimble, Lara and Totec have fairly divergent abilities. Lara has her conventional arsenal, as well as a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-5\" href=\"/grapple/3055-5/\" slug=\"grapple\">grappling hook</a>, while Totec has an endless supply of throwing spears and a shield, and both have explosives that can be dropped and then triggered remotely. <br/> <br/> These abilities seem simple at face value, but there's a lot of interdependence built into them that make this a pretty deeply cooperative experience. For example, Lara can use her grappling hook to create tightropes for Totec to walk across, while Totec's spears can be thrown into walls, creating temporary paths that only Lara is slight enough to take. It's a really well-thought-out system that demands some real cooperation--when you're playing cooperatively, you're truly reliant on your partner to progress and survive. <br/> <br/>Catch is, at least as of this writing, the online co-op component of Guardian of Light doesn't actually exist, though developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-959\" href=\"/crystal-dynamics-inc/3010-959/\" slug=\"crystal-dynamics-inc\">Crystal Dynamics</a> has promised that this feature will be patched in at a later date. It's categorically bad news when a major feature like this doesn't make it in time for a game's release, and this could've been a real deal-breaker, but it speaks to the quality of Crystal Dynamics' craft that its still been able to offer a single-player experience that doesn't feel terribly compromised. There are some puzzles that are harder or easier in single-player than they would be in multiplayer, and it's not hard to spot the points where the level was clearly designed for two players, but frankly, you move so damn fast through most of the game that there's little time to dwell on the occasional inconsistencies.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1292523-lara_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1292523\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1292523-lara_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1292523\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3068/1292523-lara_03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3068/1292523-lara_03.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Gah! Spiders!

It's a fun, propulsive six hours for sure, though Guardian of Light gives good reasons to play through repeatedly, with a huge number of optional, skill-and-score-based objectives that, when completed, reward you with various trinkets and treasures which you can equip that can have a tangible impact on your various abilities. You'll also find lots of optional, self-contained tombs as you move through the game that provide similar rewards, provided you can crack their dastardly code.<br/> <br/> I can understand why <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\" slug=\"square-enix\">Square Enix</a> and Crystal Dynamics might not want to put the Tomb Raider name on Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, considering the ways in which it diverges from the typical Tomb Raider experience.

This mid-century tale of Sicilian immigrant turned low-level mob enforcer <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8707\" href=\"/vito-scaletta/3005-8707/\" slug=\"vito-scaletta\">Vito Scaletta</a> borrows so much from genre classics like <i><a data-ref-id=\"3025-1132\" href=\"/the-godfather/3025-1132/\" slug=\"the-godfather\">The Godfather</a></i>, <i><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/goodfellas/16-167653/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goodfellas</a></i>, and <i><a data-ref-id=\"3030-8694\" href=\"/the-sopranos-road-to-respect/3030-8694/\" slug=\"the-sopranos-road-to-respect\">The Sopranos</a></i> that it's almost a surprise to see their respective filmmakers go uncredited at the end of the game. You end up with a lot of (maybe too many) recognizable elements and scenarios mashed together--dead bodies in trunks, mob bosses living in luxury behind bars, wiseguys turned Federal informants, traditionalist dons clinging to the old country fighting with American-bred bosses who are into dealing dope--that do fit together reasonably well and result in a few genuinely exciting moments toward the end. But you have to slog through just as many predictable turns, and a lot of uninspired game design--driving and shooting, then more driving and shooting, then still more driving--to get to them. Then, just when it seems like it's about to really get going, the game is over.<br/> <br/> Cliched or not, the plot would be strong enough to support Mafia II if it were a better action game than it is. This is an open-world game that doesn't utilize or really even need its open world. The story progression is completely linear--there's only one plot-related mission available at any given time--and there are no side missions or activities to speak of, leaving the sprawling metropolis of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1769\" href=\"/empire-bay/3035-1769/\" slug=\"empire-bay\">Empire Bay</a> to feel like so much finely crafted window dressing. There's some simple pleasure in hopping in a classic car and tooling around the beautifully rendered period trappings of the city, but at a certain point, you realize you're spending the majority of your time in the game merely ferrying yourself and some number of cohorts to or from your next mission objective, and this isn't an especially lengthy game to begin with.<br/> <br/> Mafia II doesn't really take into account the eight years of progress in open-world game design since the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15879\" href=\"/mafia/3030-15879/\" slug=\"mafia\">Mafia</a> came out. Not only is there a conspicuous lack of significant activities to keep you busy between missions, most of the missions themselves merely revolve around functional third-person shooting that's really nothing you haven't seen before. At least there are some impressive surroundings in which to do all that shooting, like a lavishly decorated Chinese restaurant, a planetarium, and lots of the decrepit industrial parks and seedy-looking back rooms where mobsters seem to love doing business. To be fair, there are two sorts of collectibles scattered around the game world (one of which notoriously features several dozen <i>Playboy</i> centerfolds) that don't really add much to the experience of playing the game.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1046018-screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1046018\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1046018-screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1046018\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1046018-screen002.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You'll also do a whole lot of shooting.      </figcaption></figure>In general, it's stop, pop, rinse and repeat from one mission to the next, and other than the occasional fistfight or car chase (there's that reliance on driving again), it's hard to play more than a handful of the story's 15 chapters without feeling like you've done all this before. Like the storyline, the missions have a couple of standout moments--an explosive assassination attempt atop the city's tallest, snazziest hotel comes to mind--but there aren't enough of them to keep the action moving consistently through the game. It's worth noting that the shooting is more precise (and the frame rate much smoother) on the PC, the platform the original Mafia originated on. That's probably the best platform to play the game on, despite the presence of some thin, action-oriented free DLC on the PS3.<br/> <br/> Sandbox games used to be largely about making your own fun by taking advantage of a broad set of free-form gameplay tools, but I think Mafia II exemplifies a paradox that's been emerging as these games have evolved, as they've further humanized their protagonists, and rendered their urban environments in more and more lifelike detail. You just can't play this kind of game that carelessly anymore if you care about the underlying narrative. A guy like Vito Scaletta is no longer just a faceless cipher you use to run around wantonly wreaking havoc and killing innocent people. You see him serving in World War II, breaking bread with his meek little Sicilian mamma, looking out for his sister when the loan sharks come calling. The game does a decent job of making him feel like a real person, albeit one leading a morally questionable lifestyle. But either way, he's no fool.<br/> <br/> It comes down to a question of how much larger-than-life absurdity you can accept in a story-driven game. Even the most hardened criminal doesn't run around spraying bullets in broad daylight, and given how intently Mafia II focuses on putting you in the role of a single character rising through the ranks in a believable depiction of mob life, it breaks the story's plausibility when you run amok the way you gleefully did in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto-iii\">Grand Theft Auto III</a>. Admittedly, it's entirely a matter of personal preference and play style, but I felt boxed in by the relatively realistic nature of the story. That feeling, combined with the lack of explicitly designed side missions and activities, left me to simply play through the story missions in a straight line over a dozen or so hours, watch the ending, and turn the game off.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9712/1464132-mafia2_2010_08_11_20_21_07_91.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1464132\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9712/1464132-mafia2_2010_08_11_20_21_07_91.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1464132\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9712/1464132-mafia2_2010_08_11_20_21_07_91.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9712/1464132-mafia2_2010_08_11_20_21_07_91.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Then of course there's the driving.</figcaption></figure>     Despite the dated game design, I couldn't help getting sort of attached to some of Mafia II's more colorful characters, or maybe it's more accurate that I at least developed some interest in finding out their ultimate fates. There's an endless parade of Italian gangsters here, so it's to the credit of the writing and voiceover that it's easy to keep them all straight, figure out who's working for whom, and get a general sense of Empire Bay's larger criminal underworld. There's a lot of entertaining, colorful (mostly blue) dialogue that at least enlivens your incessant driving from place to place, and spices up most of the cutscenes, even if that cutscene is basically the only thing you get to see or do when you arrive at your destination.<br/> <br/> Playing Mafia II gives you the feeling that the developers put more emphasis on telling a great mob story than designing a great video game, but had to split their attention too much to effectively do either one. That story would have probably been better served if the game had shed its superfluous open-world trappings and focused on quicker pacing and greater diversity in the mission design. There are a lot of great mob stories out there already, and this one needed more focus to stand out next to all the memorable tales that came before.    ", "deck": "This decent tale of ascension through the mob ranks feels a little outdated as an actual video game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-311/", "platforms": "PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20538/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mafia-ii/3030-20538/", "id": 20538, "name": "Mafia II"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-08-23 19:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-79303/", "id": 79303, "name": "Mafia II"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/metroid-other-m-review/1900-312/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1458943-03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1458943\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1458943-03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1458943\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1458943-03.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Meet Samus Aran, action heroine.     </figcaption></figure>     My history with <a data-ref-id=\"3025-3\" href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\" slug=\"metroid\"> Metroid</a> goes all the way back to some kid telling me about <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21761\" href=\"/metroid/3030-21761/\" slug=\"metroid\"> Justin Bailey</a> on the playground in grade school, which means I've spent over two decades exploring remote alien caverns, hunting down <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1926\" href=\"/energy-tank/3055-1926/\" slug=\"energy-tank\"> energy tanks</a>, rolling up into a ball to drop bombs, and shooting <a data-ref-id=\"3055-74\" href=\"/missile/3055-74/\" slug=\"missile\"> missiles</a> at <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\" href=\"/ridley/3005-1305/\" slug=\"ridley\"> Ridley</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3010\" href=\"/kraid/3005-3010/\" slug=\"kraid\"> Kraid</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1302\" href=\"/mother-brain/3005-1302/\" slug=\"mother-brain\"> Mother Brain</a>.

It's a strange hybrid of 2D and 3D third-person action that you play solely with a bare <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1304\" href=\"/wii-remote/3055-1304/\" slug=\"wii-remote\"> Wii Remote</a> turned on its side, NES controller-style. You're almost always in fully 3D environments, but a lot of those levels contain invisible paths that cause Samus to, say, run smoothly along a curved hallway while you're simply holding to the right, instead of making you constantly adjust your movement up and to the side. Combine that seamless, gentle guidance with an auto-aim function that makes Samus shoot at any enemies she's vaguely pointing at, and there are times Other M almost feels like a true successor to its hallowed sidescrolling predecessors.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1405081-rvl_metroidom_07ss17_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405081\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1405081-rvl_metroidom_07ss17_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405081\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1405081-rvl_metroidom_07ss17_e3.jpg\"></a><figcaption> It's wise to use the first-person mode, uh, wisely.</figcaption></figure>     To be honest, a new 2D Metroid (in the style of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26706\" href=\"/shadow-complex/3030-26706/\" slug=\"shadow-complex\"> Shadow Complex</a>) is all I've wanted since the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1319\" href=\"/metroid-prime/3025-1319/\" slug=\"metroid-prime\"> Metroid Prime</a> franchise wrapped up, and it's when Other M strays from that desirable ideal into 3D territory that its control limitations occasionally start to show. The auto-aim isn't perfect when enemies are coming at you from all sides; you'll sometimes find yourself shooting at enemies you don't want to be shooting at, or missing others entirely. And moving around in a 360-degree space with only eight-way control sometimes feels awkward and limiting, as in those areas where there's no invisible path for Samus to follow and you find yourself having to zigzag along clumsily to navigate the environment. The fixed camera perspective means that foreground walls will occasionally get in your face, and while the game is generally good about making these transparent, they can still block your view once in a while when the action heats up.<br/> <br/>These problems don't surface often, but they're present often enough to be noticeable. They are however mitigated to an extent by some slick action moves, like an automatic dodge that kicks in pretty much any time you're near a threat, and the ability to jump on top of most larger enemies and blast them up close for a quick, clean kill. These are the times when you can see Team Ninja getting closest to its roots, when you enter vaguely circular rooms and have to survive self-contained encounters with groups of enemies. The developer's legacy of making great action games comes to bear in these intense combat moments. It can be a pretty thrilling action game, when you're acting on instinct and using all of Samus' abilities together to take on large groups of enemies at once. You have to give your instincts over to the way the game works to really play it smoothly; the auto-dodge maneuver, for instance, is usually a better solution than simply jumping out of the way of danger.<br/><br/> This game isn't the revelation that Metroid Prime was, where you sat straight up and went \"Holy [expletive of choice], they put Metroid in first-person and made it <i>work</i>.\" But it does share Prime's first-person view, in this case requiring you to point the Wii Remote at the screen. That gives you precision aiming, but it also immobilizes you, meaning you have to be careful to put some distance between yourself and enemies before you use the first-person mode. This mode generally works fine, and it does lock onto enemies and the relevant background elements required for puzzle-solving, but since you automatically look in the direction the Samus character model is facing, you have to constantly consider your positioning to make sure you don't try to aim at your enemies and wind up pointing into the corner instead, with them closing in behind you. All the combat controls require a great deal of finesse, but then, that's true of most demanding action games. This one certainly is demanding, especially some of the later boss encounters.<br/>   <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283727-ss_movie_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283727\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283727-ss_movie_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283727\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1283727-ss_movie_02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1283727-ss_movie_02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The presentation of Samus' back story can be a little hokey at times, but there's payoff at the end.     </figcaption></figure>     Other M takes place directly after <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\" href=\"/super-metroid/3030-8292/\" slug=\"super-metroid\"> Super Metroid</a>, when Samus finds herself wandering the galaxy in search of another bounty to collect but obviously still affected by the death of the baby Metroid that came to regard her as a mother figure in that Super NES classic. She answers a distress call from a derelict research vessel called the Bottle Ship and by chance runs into a commando squad under the direction of Samus' old commanding officer <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11131\" href=\"/adam-malkovich/3005-11131/\" slug=\"adam-malkovich\"> Adam Malkovich</a>, her history with whom the game sets up through occasional flashbacks and a surprising amount of dialogue. This is the first game in the franchise that's really attempted to humanize Samus and surround her with a supporting cast, but for the most part it does so flatly and without much gravity. Samus' voiceover is painfully dull at times, and the game introduces some frailty in her character that struck me as out of place for someone who's exterminated entire planets' worth of awful monsters. There <i>is</i> a legitimate dramatic payoff as events come to a head toward the end, though, especially as the story fleshes out some aspects of, and makes some interesting additions to, the longstanding Metroid mythology. (I don't know if you could say Metroid had much of a \"mythology\" before, but it does now.)<br/> <br/>Actually, that's where Other M really excels: giving fans of Metroid exactly what they want to see. As great as the Prime games were, they veered pretty far afield of the series' core fiction, but by contrast, this game is right on target. I won't give away too many specifics, but if you can think of a common enemy, weapon, or story point from the first three Metroid games, rest assured there's at least some reference to it in here. The game opens with a CG recreation of the climactic finale of Super Metroid. And later on, a character even vocalizes the word \"<a data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\" href=\"/tourian/3035-1576/\" slug=\"tourian\"> Tourian</a>.\" Who but diehard Metroid fans even remember what Tourian is? If you have any fondness for the early days of the series, it's kind of thrilling to hear that sort of thing spoken out loud; it's a tantalizingly specific reference that points back to the almost nonexistent narrative aura that surrounded old NES games, when the only thin wisp of storyline came from the paragraph in the front of the instruction booklet. It's fan service, but extremely well implemented fan service. It reminds you of what you loved about Metroid.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1405078-rvl_metroidom_04ss11_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405078\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1405078-rvl_metroidom_04ss11_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405078\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1405078-rvl_metroidom_04ss11_e3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1405078-rvl_metroidom_04ss11_e3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Yep, definitely a Metroid game.</figcaption></figure>     Likewise the flow of the game. However well the combat and controls do or don't work at any given time--and they generally do work well--this definitely feels like a Metroid game in pacing and format. It turns out the Bottle Ship is basically a giant floating Holodeck that can simulate any naturalistic environment, which in nuts-and-bolts terms lets the designers give you your lava area, your ice area, a desert, and so on. You move from one sector to the next, amassing your arsenal of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-906\" href=\"/ice-beam/3055-906/\" slug=\"ice-beam\"> ice beams</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1928\" href=\"/super-missile/3055-1928/\" slug=\"super-missile\"> super missiles</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-504\" href=\"/screw-attack/3015-504/\" slug=\"screw-attack\"> screw attacks</a>, all of which give you access to new areas and let you find more hidden missile tanks and other optional bonuses hidden within the environment. <br/> <br/>A great deal of care went into the environmental puzzles in Other M, requiring you to use first-person often to look around a room when you hit a dead end, looking for loose panels to bomb or finding a hidden morph tunnel, or enough room to use your speed booster to plow through a wall. Of course, you need to gain access to all those classic abilities before you can use them to advance. There's a silly story contrivance here where Samus actually goes into the mission already in possession of all this stuff, and Adam merely authorizes her to use it when she needs it, but that's really only in place to avoid yet another, arguably more contrived <a data-ref-id=\"3015-57\" href=\"/abilitease/3015-57/\" slug=\"abilitease\"> abilitease</a> scenario. The point is, you're constantly engaging in that timeless interplay between new areas of the game and the new gear necessary to access those areas. It's the formula that drives every great Metroid--and has also been used to great effect in some of my other favorite games, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-asylum\"> Arkham Asylum</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14216\" href=\"/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/3030-14216/\" slug=\"castlevania-symphony-of-the-night\"> Symphony of the Night</a>--and Other M nails it.<br/> <br/>It may not fully nail every one of its ambitions, but Other M at least gets close on all of them. More importantly, it really feels like an honest-to-goodness Metroid game.

That's not to say that its affection for, and attempt to refine, the old-school stylings of the genre are the only things Shank has going for it. Really, Shank's greatest function is as a showcase for an angular and brutal art style which conspires with a fluid and also-brutal animation system to provide the game with a really sublimely violent and high-impact first impression. Shank teems with satisfying gameplay moments, and it's a sadistic pleasure to look at, but it's still haunted by the genre's two-headed specter of repetition and brevity.<br/> <br/> Perhaps the biggest surprise in Shank for me was just how much time the game spends on its story, even if it's all in service of the game's film-scratched vibe. The basic beats of the story aren't much more complex than the typical kidnapped-girlfriend conceit, but this two-fisted tale of revenge is clearly influenced by the gritty Quentin Tarantino/<a data-ref-id=\"3040-28671\" href=\"/robert-rodriguez/3040-28671/\" slug=\"robert-rodriguez\">Robert Rodriguez</a> style of grindhouse storytelling.

Shank is a bad, bad dude, and you yourself will feel like a complete bad-ass juggling knots of thuggish meathead enemies with your vicious arsenal of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-680\" href=\"/shiv/3055-680/\" slug=\"shiv\">blades</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-118\" href=\"/gun/3055-118/\" slug=\"gun\">guns</a>, and chains. After an early every-bone-broken cutscene where Shank swiftly acquires his starting set of shanks, twin handguns, and a <i><a data-ref-id=\"3055-168\" href=\"/chainsaw/3055-168/\" slug=\"chainsaw\">motherfucking chainsaw</a></i>, you're loosed on the world, ready to make blood salad out of anyone that gets in your way. You'll find additional weapons like a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotgun</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-612\" href=\"/machete/3055-612/\" slug=\"machete\">machetes</a>, an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-260\" href=\"/uzi/3055-260/\" slug=\"uzi\">uzi</a>, and a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-690\" href=\"/katana/3055-690/\" slug=\"katana\">katana</a> that you can swap your starting weapons with on the fly. <br/> <br/> With three weapons at the ready at any given time, Shank has a lot of options with which to murder his opponents, and the gameplay is balanced in a way that strong-arms the player into making full use of Shank's deadly craft. Most enemies are complete pushovers in a one-on-one confrontation, but Shank is all about crowd control, requiring you to alternate between your three equipped attacks almost constantly to keep your head above the rising tide of mayhem. Some streamlined and stylish platforming action breaks up the kill-crazy rampages, though the fight is where Shank finds most of its challenge.

There are also some specific sequences where out-of-reach enemies force you to rely on your guns, which feel more like medium-range melee weapons than they do traditional firearms. Since you can only shoot up at an angle, it requires some fussy positioning.<br/> <br/> I totally get why Shank feels compelled to linger on its visuals--this is a consistently great-looking game with style and energy to spare--but the real issue is that, even with its myriad of graphic ways to make a man into Manwich, the action in Shank can become a bit of a grind, despite a runtime that clocks in at around three hours. Even from the start, the enemies you face can soak up an alarming amount of damage, though once you acclimate to the rhythms of the action and understand how to approach different enemies, their long life bars start to feel like filler. There's also a unique co-op campaign, but it's limited to local play, and honestly, by the time I finished the solo game, my desire to play any more Shank had been pretty well quenched.<br/> <br/> Downloadable games are evolving at an unbelievable clip right now, and one of the associated growing pains is an issue of perceived value, of quality versus quantity. There are some incredible peaks in Shank that I think are entirely worth experiencing, and it can be a pleasure to play, at least for a while.

New hero and, apparently, motocross champ <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12914\" href=\"/chuck-greene/3005-12914/\" slug=\"chuck-greene\">Chuck Greene</a> is enroute to the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-78\" href=\"/las-vegas/3035-78/\" slug=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</a>-like <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2780\" href=\"/fortune-city/3035-2780/\" slug=\"fortune-city\">Fortune City</a> with his zombie-virus-infected daughter <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15069\" href=\"/katey-greene/3005-15069/\" slug=\"katey-greene\">Katey</a>, and Case Zero focuses on the pair's brief stint in the tiny desert stopover town of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2914\" href=\"/still-creek/3035-2914/\" slug=\"still-creek\">Still Creek</a>, as Chuck desperately tries to secure some new wheels and find more of the miracle drug <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5678\" href=\"/zombrex/3015-5678/\" slug=\"zombrex\">Zombrex</a> that Katey so badly needs in order to not become, you know, a little-girl zombie.<br/> <br/> Cue anywhere from two to five hours of the same sort of irreverent insanity that fueled the first Dead Rising. You find ridiculous outfits for Chuck ranging from a plaid suit to a waitress's outfit. You run into other crazed survivors with their own ridiculous predilections and neuroses. And you orchestrate large-scale zombie slaughter with absolutely everything you find in the environment, from firearms to garden implements to <a data-ref-id=\"3005-681\" href=\"/servbot/3005-681/\" slug=\"servbot\">servbot</a> heads. Dead Rising 2 trades in the old photojournalist picture-taking minigame for an item-combination system that you just get a short glimpse of here. Baseball bats combine with nails in obvious ways, but wait till you see what happens when you put together a drill and a bucket, or a rake and a car battery. It's ridiculous and satisfying stuff.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3507/1408041-989132_20100616_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1408041\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3507/1408041-989132_20100616_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1408041\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3507/1408041-989132_20100616_screen001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3507/1408041-989132_20100616_screen001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> You'd think the survivors would want to stick together.</figcaption></figure>     We talk a lot about games being janky around here. Jankiness (is that even the proper noun form?) is defined by any combination of rough elements like low frame rates, long loading times, items disappearing randomly, animations causing unwieldy controls, textures looking a little flat, and more. Case Zero is pretty janky. All of those elements are present in some small degree--not enough to ruin the game, but enough to be irksome a couple of times over the course of the game. But they're worth putting up with. In addition to playing through the short storyline, there are enough optional item combinations and extra survivors to hunt down and save (and achievements rewarding each) that you could play through Case Zero three or four times before seeing everything there is to see. It's a lot of game for only five dollars, and I loved every minute of it.<br/> <br/> Dead Rising is such an oddball series that its janky elements just feel like part of the experience at this point, anyway. My only other knock against Case Zero is that it's barely long enough to get you hooked on the character progression and item-combining that will be in the full game before it cuts you off, leaving you impatiently wanting more. And if you do happen to want more, you can carry your save file over right into the retail game, retaining your experience and so on. For what actually <i>could</i> have turned out to be a paid demo, Capcom pretty much hit this one out of the park. It's a shame you can only get Case Zero on the Xbox 360, though Dead Rising 2 will also hit the PS3 and PC. Next time, let's hope a bite-size promotional tool that ends up being this great is available to everybody.    ", "deck": "Five dollars is an absurdly low price for the equally absurd, wholesale zombie slaughter in this download.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-314/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30018/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dead-rising-2-case-zero/3030-30018/", "id": 30018, "name": "Dead Rising 2: Case Zero"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-09-01 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-98697/", "id": 98697, "name": "Dead Rising: Case Zero"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/halo-reach-review/1900-315/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1460285-reach_lnos_beach.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1460285\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1460285-reach_lnos_beach.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1460285\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1460285-reach_lnos_beach.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The Spartans have changed, but the game remains the same: shoot grunts in the face.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26786\" href=\"/halo-reach/3030-26786/\" slug=\"halo-reach\">  Halo: Reach</a> is exactly the kind of game that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-476\" href=\"/bungie-studios/3010-476/\" slug=\"bungie-studios\">  Bungie</a> has gotten great at building over the last two generations of console hardware. It's a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2\" href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" slug=\"halo\">  Halo</a> game through and through, with the same style and pacing that you've come to expect, but with a new cast of characters that are worth paying attention to and a multiplayer mode that has more variety than it's ever had before. It's not going to change your mind about Halo, but this special delivery for fans of the franchise is a great send-off as Bungie ends its involvement with the franchise to go work on something new.<br/> <br/> Halo: Reach is a prequel to the first game in the series, providing some perspective on events that take place just before the opening of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\" href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" slug=\"halo-combat-evolved\">  Halo: Combat Evolved</a>. It also provides some perspective that isn't found in the book upon which these events are based, <i>Halo: The Fall of Reach</i>. So while you'll probably already know that things are about to go very, very bad on the planet called <a data-ref-id=\"3035-571\" href=\"/reach/3035-571/\" slug=\"reach\">  Reach</a>, you don't know the specifics about how the attack went down. The story focuses more on a group of six <a data-ref-id=\"3015-666\" href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" slug=\"spartan\">  Spartans</a> called <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5853\" href=\"/noble-team/3015-5853/\" slug=\"noble-team\">  Noble Team</a>, who encounters <a data-ref-id=\"3015-81\" href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" slug=\"the-covenant\">  Covenant</a> forces on the planet, immediately sending the entire world into chaos. You'll play as a Spartan referred to as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13970\" href=\"/spartan-312/3005-13970/\" slug=\"spartan-312\">  Noble Six</a> throughout the game. Six's shadowy past paints him as something of a lone wolf bad-ass in the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-175\" href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" slug=\"master-chief\">  Master Chief</a> mold, but Six is new to the team, so you'll be paired up with and taking orders from the rest of your unit as you work your way from one conflict to the next. Though the constant conflict doesn't leave much time for the other five members of Noble Team to get personal, most of the characters manage to be interesting, which makes the story work well enough to keep it engaging.<br/> <br/> If you've played just about any of the previous Halo shooters, you won't be too surprised by what you find in Reach. The pacing, structure, and most of the equipment have popped up in the previous games. Bungie didn't go \"reinvent the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3725\" href=\"/ma37-assault-rifle/3055-3725/\" slug=\"ma37-assault-rifle\">  Assault Rifle</a>\" or anything silly like that. And unlike its past game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\" href=\"/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\" slug=\"halo-3-odst\">  Halo 3: ODST</a>, Reach returns to a more conventional format, moving you directly from level to level without any sort of hub world. Though you'll often be teamed up with one or more of the other Spartans from your team, the gameplay doesn't really change as a result. They behave just like any other AI in the game, shooting when appropriate and automatically teleporting up to you at checkpoints if you decide to leave them behind. It might have been nice--and would have driven home the unique nature of Noble Team--if those guys were integrated more tightly into the action. The story does take a couple of twists, though, setting up some interesting vehicle sequences and some bits that are slightly more open-ended than Halo games have been, traditionally speaking.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1460289-reach_lnos_cinematic03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1460289\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1460289-reach_lnos_cinematic03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1460289\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1460289-reach_lnos_cinematic03.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Unlike the Master Chief, these Noble guys will let you see their faces.</figcaption></figure>     Depending on which difficulty setting you choose--Bungie is again recommending that experienced players start on the second-highest difficulty setting, Heroic--and your own personal skill, Halo: Reach's solo campaign will probably land somewhere between seven and 12 hours. Though I've certainly appreciated the last couple of shooters in the series, by the end of Reach's campaign I found myself rushing past some encounters, hoping to skate to the next checkpoint without doing as much fighting. The combat is very similar to previous Halo games, and I feel like the last level or two drag a bit when compared to the rest of the game. It's too bad, too, because that's when the story starts to become familiar, as it begins to tie into things you'll probably remember from previous Halo games.<br/> <br/> Rushing past those encounters is enabled by the game's new armor abilities. These are slotted and swapped out just like a weapon, though you can hit the left bumper to activate your currently equipped ability. The default ability is a sprint, which is great, especially if you're the sort of person that wishes that Halo had a slightly faster pace. You can't run forever, though. All of the abilities have a meter that drains when activated and takes a bit of time to recharge. In the campaign, you'll occasionally find other armor abilities out in the field, allowing you to swap out the sprint for a jetpack, a cloaking device, a couple of different shield options, and so on. These armor abilities also factor into the game's multiplayer.<br/> <br/> OK, multiplayer. It's kind of a big deal in the Halo universe, right? In Reach, the options and abilities have grown quite a bit. Campaign co-op is still there for up to four players and can be played with or without scoring. It's also supported by the game's matchmaking features, allowing you to play through the campaign with strangers. For those of you without a bunch of Halo-loving friends who want to get a team together, this is a terrific addition. Matchmaking has also come to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5869\" href=\"/firefight/3015-5869/\" slug=\"firefight\">  Firefight</a>, the wave-based survival mode introduced in ODST. That's a great enhancement, too, but it's not the only thing going on with Firefight.<br/> <br/> The default mode has changed a bit to make it more inviting overall, but it's what you can do with the addition of custom variants that makes Firefight so much more interesting. Much like Halo 3's multiplayer, you can tweak a ton of different things to make modes that feel very different from the default. If you'd like, you can enable generators that must be protected from the incoming Covenant forces. You can set which types of enemies come at you in every wave, or tweak your starting health, or alter damage modifiers on weapons and health... essentially, you can make it completely impossible, mind-numbingly easy, or just about anything in-between. Incidentally, making it incredibly easy is handy if you're the sort of person who wants to get some of Halo: Reach's Firefight <a data-ref-id=\"3015-29\" href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" slug=\"achievements\">  achievements</a> without breaking a sweat. The Firefight maps in Reach also feel more interesting than most of the arenas and other maps found in ODST.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1465844-orange.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465844\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1465844-orange.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465844\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1465844-orange.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1465844-orange.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Forge mode has been expanded and a new Forge World map is ready for you to lay down all kinds of structures to build your own maps.</figcaption></figure>     The rest of Reach's multiplayer package builds on that game variant creation stuff that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\" href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" slug=\"halo-3\">  Halo 3</a> introduced, which is made deeper by the addition of new modes and options. Now, with the inclusion of armor abilities, you select a loadout before spawning. Loadouts are determined by gametype, and you can build (or restrict) custom loadouts when creating a game variant. So if you want everyone to have jet-packs and hammers, you can totally do that. The game also codifies the race mode that users created out of the VIP gametype back in Halo 3 and adds a new multi-tiered match called Invasion, where Spartans and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-470\" href=\"/elites/3015-470/\" slug=\"elites\">  Elites</a> go at it in an objective-based match that puts one team on offense and the other on defense. Matchmaking lets users vote on the next map, rather than just vetoing whatever the current choice is, and the whole thing feels smoother than it's been in the past, whether you're looking to group up with friends or find strange corpses to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-142\" href=\"/tea-bagging/3015-142/\" slug=\"tea-bagging\">  duck over</a>. Regardless of how you feel about the way Halo games play online or the community of foul-mouthed hooligans it stereotypically draws (though a new \"psych profile\" feature attempts to match you up with \"polite\" players, if that's your thing), the feature-set and options when configuring and getting into a game are completely unmatched in the world of console shooters.<br/> <br/> Visually, the game looks sharper and has better texture clarity than its predecessors, though the frame rate can get a little unstable, particularly during the game's real-time cutscenes. It's nice that those cutscenes are being rendered on the fly, though, since you're constantly earning credits that can be used to buy various armor add-ons. They're totally cosmetic, but it's neat to be able to pick up new helmets, shoulder pads, chest plates, and so on as you play, and this helps you make your Noble Six a little more personal. You can also purchase additional voices to be used in Firefight mode, and these include the cast of Reach as well as some throwbacks from previous Halo games.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1480918-hangar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1480918\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56285714285714\" data-width=\"700\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1480918-hangar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1480918\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1480918-hangar.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1480918-hangar.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The multiplayer maps offer a good variety of small and large areas.</figcaption></figure>     Most of those voices are really good, and Noble Team is especially full of quality voice actors, though they don't necessarily speak all that often in the grand scheme of things. The music, as you might expect, flips some of the common Halo themes in bits and pieces, but it's mostly an all-new soundtrack that fits right in with the look and feel of the action.<br/> <br/> When taken with the appropriate context--namely, that the game's original developer is saying goodbye to the series and passing it off to a new team--Halo: Reach feels like a wholly appropriate stopping point for the series, filling out some more of the relevant fiction that surrounds the core trilogy while building the multiplayer out in such a way that Halo fans will have something to play until whatever's next is ready for release. While I do feel that the formula has worn thin in a few spots, Reach feels like a love letter from the developer to its fans.

Sports Champions might lack the charm and spirit of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a>'s flagship Wii release, but the game itself is a lot of fun, both as a multiplayer sort of \"party\" experience and as an easy first test for what, exactly, the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4669\" href=\"/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/\" slug=\"playstation-move-support\">PlayStation Move</a> is capable of.<br/> <br/> In fact, once you get up to the harder difficulty settings in Champions' six sports, you might start to feel like the Move equipment is a little <i>too</i> capable. There's something to be said for reining in your movements to make a game of table tennis more accessible, and as a result, I tended to enjoy the easier bronze difficulty over silver or gold. On bronze, most of the games provide a level of assistance, which shows you where to position your table tennis paddle, the proper time to raise up for a volleyball spike, and so on. Unfortunately, playing on bronze results in you being matched up with fairly boneheaded AI when you're playing alone, so playing the game by yourself means you'll have to either take off the training wheels or be satisfied by crushing your opposition. Of course, the directly competitive games are far more interesting when you're playing with other people.<br/> <br/> There are six different games to choose from in Sports Champions, each with a single-player ladder mode that works you through the different difficulties and eventually unlocks a set of minigames in a \"challenge\" mode. You can also play in free-play mode by yourself, if you like, which lets you pick a background stage and your opponent.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1296514-gd_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296514\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1296514-gd_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296514\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1296514-gd_03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Gladiator Duel is better if you have two Move controllers. </figcaption></figure>     For my money, the best of the six games is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3491\" href=\"/table-tennis/3015-3491/\" slug=\"table-tennis\">table tennis</a>. It's frantic and one of the better showcases for what the Move can do. Flipping between forehand and backhand is as easy as, you know, flipping the Move controller from one side to the other. It also looks and feels very close to 1:1 movement with the paddle. If you tilt the controller, you'll see the paddle tilt accordingly. More importantly, your shots reflect that positioning extremely well. The angle of your paddle and the force with which you move it--and the hardware seems very good at detecting high-speed motion--acts how you would expect it to act. If you move the paddle forward, you can play closer to the net, and vice versa. At higher difficulty settings, the game stops showing you where to place your paddle and when to swing. I also get the impression that the easiest setting prevents you from getting too far away from the action, making it more about timing your swings properly. Once you bump it up, you'll need to start swinging in the right spots, too. That might not sound like much, but it's actually quite a bit harder. <br/><br/> The rest of the games aren't quite as frantic as table tennis. Disc golf, for example, is downright leisurely. Really, you're just throwing frisbees at chain baskets with, as you might expect, golf rules. You can select from three different discs, each of which travels a different maximum distance, and just like real life, I'm kind of bad at it. It's weird, I used to be able to throw a real frisbee just fine, with actual accuracy. Now, I usually toss high, curving shots that drift off to the right and are only fun to catch if you're a dog. Considering the game replicates my real-life shortcomings pretty well, I'd call it accurate.<br/> <br/><a data-ref-id=\"3015-4295\" href=\"/archery/3015-4295/\" slug=\"archery\"> Archery</a> is one of the games that works best if you have two Move controllers. You can play it with one, but with two, the actual act of grabbing an arrow and drawing your bow back is more like the real thing. This one is played as a race against the clock and against another archer, so the object is to be fast and accurate. Different configurations of targets are also available, so if you just want three static targets or distant watermelons, you've got options. It's a good showcase of what one person can do with two Move controllers, but not the best example of it that Sports Champions has to offer.<br/> <br/> Gladiator Duel is the best example of what you can do with two Move controllers. In this game, you're armed with a weapon--like a sword or a mace--as well as a shield. So you'll wield one motion controller up front like your shield, positioning it properly to block incoming attacks and setting up swings of your own from the other motion controller. The buttons on the controller let you perform shield bashes, sidestep, or otherwise dodge incoming attacks. It's not especially deep, but again, it's an effective way to get a feel for what the Move can do.<br/> <br/> Beach <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4830\" href=\"/volleyball/3015-4830/\" slug=\"volleyball\">volleyball</a> also lets you use two controllers, but you don't really need them. Bumping, setting, and spiking is pretty similar either way. This two-on-two game of volleyball feels a little stripped down, since you don't actually have to move around the court. It's functional, but not much fun.<br/> <br/> You know what is fun, though? Bocce! I know what you're thinking. You're all, like, \"Finally! Someone has provided a digital, interactive bocce experience that I can enjoy instead of having to go find a bunch of old men who smell of solvents and hard candy!\" All kidding aside, this is a game about making underhanded tosses in an attempt to land balls near other balls. It's sort of like horseshoes. Where it gets interesting is in the more advanced stages, which put you in front of a minigolf-like windmill or other oddly shaped courses. It's not bad and lends some variety to the package.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1296513-ar_windmill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296513\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1296513-ar_windmill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296513\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1296513-ar_windmill.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1296513-ar_windmill.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Archery's technically proficient, but not as engaging as some of the other games.</figcaption></figure>     Sports Champions has a technically proficient look, with nice-looking characters and nicer-looking environments. But most of the presentation feels aggressively plain. The characters are all fairly realistic, and the way the Asian girl performs martial arts poses when she wins is... well, it's super stereotypical, actually. But stuff like that is as close as Sports Champions gets to having any real personality. For the most part, the characters grunt and vocalize in very lifeless ways, and the pristine areas in which you compete don't do anything to amp up the proceedings. It's sterile where a game like Wii Sports is charming. This, more than anything else, is Sports Champions' largest flaw.<br/> <br/> While that flat feeling makes Sports Champions feel more like a technology demo than the sort of thing you want to dig out anytime anyone comes over to your house for a visit, the package is solid and mostly satisfying. It's the perfect game to bundle with the hardware, since it gives you enough gameplay and variety to keep you engaged long enough for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-313\" href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" slug=\"sony-computer-entertainment-america\">Sony</a> to cook up something else compelling to do with your Move controller.", "deck": "Sports Champions feels cold and calculated, but it's hard to argue with its solid base of motion-based gameplay.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-316/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30349/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sports-champions/3030-30349/", "id": 30349, "name": "Sports Champions"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-09-15 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101604/", "id": 101604, "name": "Sports Champions"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-v-review/1900-317/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1275282-civilization_v_pc_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275282\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1275282-civilization_v_pc_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275282\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/45471/1275282-civilization_v_pc_006.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Say hello to Civ V, and goodbye to all of your spare time.</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">According to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-718\" href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" slug=\"steam\">Steam</a>, I've played <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30057\" href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-v/3030-30057/\" slug=\"sid-meiers-civilization-v\">Sid Meier's Civilization V</a> for 24 hours. One <a data-ref-id=\"3035-65\" href=\"/earth/3035-65/\" slug=\"earth\">Earth</a> day! For most games today, 24 hours represents the entirety of the single-player experience, all the post-release DLC, and maybe a few hours checking out multiplayer. And that's on a good Earth day. For Civ V, 24 hours is barely scratching the surface of what this intelligently designed turn-based strategy game has to offer. In 24 hours time I've seen enough of Civ V that I'm familiar with its rhythms and generally understand the interlocking push-and-pull of its military, diplomatic, commerce, science, and cultural systems, but I suspect it would require hundreds of hours of play to master, if such a feat is even possible. Not that it'll stop me from trying.<br/><br/> This frightening depth, and hypnotic pacing have both long been hallmarks of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-93\" href=\"/civilization/3025-93/\" slug=\"civilization\">Civilization</a> series. There are a few significant new features in Civ V, such as the introduction of autonomous city-states, but the fundamentals of how this game plays out should be completely familiar to existing Civ fans. The level of familiarity might even be disappointing to some, if the particular brand of empire-building that Civilization is known for weren't still so thoroughly engaging. What really sets Civ V apart from its predecessors, and what makes it borderline irresponsible on the part of developer Firaxis, is how key tweaks to the interface and the underlying systems have all but obliterated the game's learning curve, making it approachable by just about anyone, regardless of past experience with strategy games of any stripe. I say this is irresponsible because established Civ players already know what what sort of diabolical time-suck they're getting into here. But new players perhaps cannot fathom how effortlessly this game will steal away huge tracts of time, regardless of the time of day or your previous obligations, be they eating, sleeping, or going to work or school. The folks at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-361\" href=\"/firaxis-games/3010-361/\" slug=\"firaxis-games\">Firaxis</a> aren't just game designers. They're <i>chemists</i>.<br/><br/> The Civilization series has maintained its position as one of the pillars of the PC strategy world pretty consistently since it first debuted way, way back in 1991, but there's still a good chance that this could be your first exposure to Civ, so here's the short version: Civ V is a turn-based empire-building strategy game that cherry-picks historical leaders and their associated civilizations, as well as significant city namesakes, landmarks, and so on, and then throws them all into a wildly anachronistic mix together. Time marches forward one turn at a time, slowly but surely taking you from a simple post-tribal society into the gleaming near-future, and you'll have opportunities to build cities, amass armies, research new technologies, start and end wars, establish trade agreements, adopt social policies, and exploit the natural resources of your land in a bid to make your civilization the dominant one. <br/> <br/></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1296161-civ52.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296161\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5712962962963\" data-width=\"1080\" style=\"width: 1080px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1296161-civ52.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296161\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39552/1296161-civ52.jpg\"></a><figcaption> A landmass like this is just untapped potential.</figcaption></figure>     There's no structured campaign to speak of, but a single game of Civ V can very easily take a dozen hours to play through, and there's a randomness to the geography and the behavior of the competing, AI-controlled civilizations, as well as a number of different ways you can win, that makes each game a unique little snowflake of world domination. I'll spare you the specific mechanical details of how this all works, because if you've played a Civ game before, you already know what's up, and if you haven't, it'll just make the whole enterprise seem like a really unappealing combination of dull and intimidating, which I assure you, it is neither. <br/> <br/> Civ V is peppered with salient quotes from famous historical figures, though none seem as applicable to the game itself as this little chestnut from Henry Ford: “Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.” He, of course, was talking about the power of the assembly line, but this is just as true of the turn-based nature of Civ. There is an incredible number of moving parts to consider as you expand your empire, and if you tried to think about all of them at once, the probability of a loved one finding you in a dark room rocking in the fetal position would be high. Taken one turn at a time, though, Civ V is incredibly engrossing, with each turn presenting some small decision that will, eventually, cumulatively, end up deciding the fate of your whole empire. That each turn feels meaningful, but not overwhelming, is part of what makes Civ V great. When combined with the slow-burning perpetual carrot-on-a-stick structure, it's what makes the game hard to quit, even when it's three in the morning and you have to get up at six.<br/> <br/> But all that's applicable to any Civ game, really. Firaxis mastered this formula years ago, but what's special about Civ V specifically is that it makes slipping into those dangerous rhythms that much easier for new players. This is in part due to a completely redesigned interface, which is clean and intuitive, a big change from the jumbled kitchen-sink approach of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16457\" href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-iv/3030-16457/\" slug=\"sid-meiers-civilization-iv\">Civ IV</a>, and something that was clearly inspired by Firaxis' time on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20580\" href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-revolution/3030-20580/\" slug=\"sid-meiers-civilization-revolution\">Civilization Revolution</a> for consoles. Impressively, these changes don't hobble the depth of Civ V, and if you want to go nuts micromanaging workers and tweaking the resource output of your individual cities, it's just a few simple clicks away. <br/> <br/> This “less is more” approach to the interface allows the playfully abstracted visuals to shine through a bit better, too. The leaders don't have quite the same caricatured look they sported in Civ IV and Civ Rev, but everything just looks cleaner and smoother. The change to hexes from squares, in addition to purportedly impacting the underlying strategy in ways I'm unable to divine, helps mask the underlying grid and makes the world feel more natural. If you've got a high-end PC, it'll take advantage of the latest DirectX 11 bells and whistles in some subtle ways, though it scales down to older machines pretty well too. There are some nice, low-key, civilization-specific musical themes that play throughout, eschewing the hokey world-music motif past Civ games have clung to, and these soothing tones help the time fly by.<p style=\"\"> <br/></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3507/1407250-civilization_v_e3_2010_bombard.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407250\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1440\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3507/1407250-civilization_v_e3_2010_bombard.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407250\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3507/1407250-civilization_v_e3_2010_bombard.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3507/1407250-civilization_v_e3_2010_bombard.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Never get involved in a land war in Asia.</figcaption></figure>     If you're a new player, there are some tutorials you can run through before getting into your first game of Civ V, but most players should be able to jump feet first into a game and intuit their way through the early turns, thanks to some well-integrated tips and a team of generally unintrusive AI advisors. The advisors can help provide some direction, something I found particularly useful when I was staring down a long list of detailed research or production options, trying to decide what the next priority for my civilization should be. Civ V strikes a nice balance with the advisors, as they'll help point you in the right direction, but they won't play the game for you.<br/><br/> For as rich and satisfying as the single-player experience in Civ V is, it's a little bit of a letdown how spartan the multiplayer options are. You can play online or over a LAN, and you can tweak things like win conditions, map size, turn limit, and so on, but there are no integrated play-by-email or single-machine hot-seat options, and though you can shift-tab to invite your Steam friends to play, it seems poorly integrated. I also experienced a fair amount of lag playing online, which seems particularly odd for a turn-based game.  <br/><p style=\"\">Between <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\" href=\"/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/3030-20674/\" slug=\"starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty\">StarCraft II</a> and Civilization V, it's been an interesting and exciting year for PC strategy games. Not to take away from either, but Civ V is, essentially, the anti-StarCraft, or at least as far as it can get while still occupying the same realm of strategy games. Either way, I cannot recommend Civ V enough to fans both old and new, or even people who hadn't considered playing a turn-based strategy game before. Which, I suppose, makes <i>me</i> the irresponsible one.   <div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p>", "deck": "Firaxis offers a hardcore turn-based strategy experience that nearly anyone can approach, without sacrificing any of its wildly addictive appeal.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-317/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30057/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sid-meiers-civilization-v/3030-30057/", "id": 30057, "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization V"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2010-09-23 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-90125/", "id": 90125, "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization V"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dead-rising-2-review/1900-318/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/1503674-upm131.feat_dead.bx_9__article_image.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1503674\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56290322580645\" data-width=\"620\" style=\"width: 620px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6087/1503674-upm131.feat_dead.bx_9__article_image.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1503674\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6087/1503674-upm131.feat_dead.bx_9__article_image.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You'll find some firearms around, both traditional and crazy.</figcaption></figure>     There are multiple ways to play <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25187\" href=\"/dead-rising-2/3030-25187/\" slug=\"dead-rising-2\">Dead Rising 2</a>. Some of them are simply amazing, giving you tons of time to wander around malls and casinos, busting up <a data-ref-id=\"3015-79\" href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" slug=\"zombie\">zombies</a> with a variety of weapons that are incredibly satisfying to use. At the other end of the spectrum, Dead Rising 2 can also be a tight, time-focused game that's more about running from one place to the next and ensuring that you're in the right place at the right time, with the right weapons to defeat whatever boss-style encounter the game has lined up for you. Dead Rising 2 runs the full range from frustration to fun, but there's more good than bad to be had here.<br/> <br/> The bulk of the bad parts in Dead Rising 2 comes at you when you're trying to play through the story or complete side missions. That's when you'll be dealing with survivors--the other humans that have somehow made it through the initial wave of the zombie attack without being bitten. If you played the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8720\" href=\"/dead-rising/3030-8720/\" slug=\"dead-rising\">Dead Rising</a>, you'll remember the survivors as ineffective dopes that were hard to save since they weren't good enough to keep the zombies at bay and follow you to safety. In Dead Rising 2, the survivors are more resilient and occasionally they're better fighters, too. Still, you'll run into cases where two armed survivors get caught in each others' crossfire or spots where they just sort of don't seem to keep up as well as they were five seconds before. They're still annoying... but they're way less of a game-breaker this time around.<br/> <br/> The other type of human you encounter while running around beautiful <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2780\" href=\"/fortune-city/3035-2780/\" slug=\"fortune-city\">Fortune City</a> is the psychopath. These guys are usually regular humans that have snapped under the strain of the zombie outbreak, and these can vary from a children's television star wearing a giant mask, roller skates, and homemade flamethrowers to a military man who's lost his team and his mind. After stumbling into one or two of these fights while taking on side missions, I did my best to just avoid them, because I didn't enjoy any of them at all. These battles don't feel like you're actually taking on a new and unique foe. Instead, they feel like barely functional combat puzzles where the main solution is to exploit the AI in one way or another. Facing an armed opponent? Run around a pillar as he gives chase, and then club him with a spiked bat when you \"catch up\" to him. Facing a guy on roller skates with two homemade flamethrowers? Well, in that case you... actually, I never beat that guy. It just didn't seem worth it, so I found a different side mission.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1470177-dead_rising_2_2010_08_18_10_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470177\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1470177-dead_rising_2_2010_08_18_10_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470177\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1470177-dead_rising_2_2010_08_18_10_12.jpg\"></a><figcaption> There are outdoor areas, but most of your time is spent in malls and casinos.</figcaption></figure>     So, you might be asking, if that's the worst of Dead Rising 2, why are you still semi-positive about the overall experience? It's the setting, some of the characters, and the open nature of your trek through the story that makes Dead Rising 2 work. If you essentially abandon the \"facts\" of the story missions, you can spend all of your game time building ridiculous combo weapons and taking out your aggressions on a shambling horde of slow-moving zombies or the occasional looter. Since Fortune City is a casino town, you can even gamble to earn a little extra cash, and that money can be used to unlock vehicles. This is a great use of money, since the vehicles stay unlocked for multiple playthroughs.<br/> <br/> Again, if you've played Dead Rising, this won't be a surprise, but Dead Rising 2 is built to be played numerous times. So much so, in fact, that every time you die or fail a case, the game gives you the option to simply restart the entire game with your bankroll and character level intact. This means that you'll become more powerful over time, and that power can be used to make the early parts of the game even easier. It also gives you another option when dealing with the game's tougher moments--you can always just start over and grind out more levels to get more inventory slots, health blocks, and attack strength.<br/> <br/> If all of this sounds a bit weird, that's OK. Dead Rising 2 is a pretty weird game. But at the heart of it is a relatively normal guy named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12914\" href=\"/chuck-greene/3005-12914/\" slug=\"chuck-greene\">Chuck Greene</a>. Chuck's an ex-motorcross racer with a daughter who needs a shot of Zombrex every 24 hours or else she'll turn into a zombie. To get money for the constant supply of drugs, Chuck gets on a pay-per-view cross of <i>The Running Man</i> and <i>American Gladiators</i> called Terror Is Reality. In it, contestants kill zombies for sport. But after his winning performance, there's a huge explosion and zombies flood the arena and the nearby malls and casinos that surround it. The military will show up in three days, but that's not exactly a good thing, as someone's released a tape to the media showing Chuck Greene (or a man in his TIR outfit) planting the bomb that let all the zombies in. This gives Chuck three days to clear his name by figuring out what's really going on in Fortune City, while saving additional survivors and procuring more of the increasingly scarce Zombrex to keep his daughter human. In other words, you've got a lot of time pressure to deal with.<br/> <br/> Dead Rising 2 eases up some of that pressure by offering you multiple save slots--the first game only had one--which gives you a way to avoid situations where you save your game in an impossible-to-fix situation, such as right before time expires on a critical mission. While some might bemoan the mission timers, it feels like a vital part of the game, and that tension drives all of the action. Getting around and killing the average zombies that attempt to block your path is a breeze, especially if you stop by one of the many maintenance rooms to do a little crafting.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93060/1504364-07_spikedbat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1504364\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"280\" style=\"width: 280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93060/1504364-07_spikedbat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1504364\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93060/1504364-07_spikedbat.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93060/1504364-07_spikedbat.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Probably the most common combo weapon of them all.</figcaption></figure>     Crafting weapons and using them is, by far, the coolest part of Dead Rising 2. You'll find all sorts of different things lying around the world that you can pick up and use, from assault rifles to rolled-up newspapers. But some items are marked with a wrench, noting that they can be combined with another item to form something that's usually more deadly. Some of these combos are basic and logical--taking a baseball bat and combining it with a box of nails gets you a spiked baseball bat, for example. But the weapons get weirder and weirder from there, such as the Freedom Bear, which is a machine gun duct-taped to a toy robot bear that normally lights up and smiles when he sees you. After the process is complete, you can set the bear out like a sentry and he'll fire at enemies that enter his sight line. Then there's absolutely devastating stuff like a fire axe strapped to a sledge hammer, making for an extremely heavy, slow-moving weapon that murders any zombie it comes into contact with with a great mix of blunt force and sharp death. And what happens when you combine a flashlight with gems? You get a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-70\" href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70/\" slug=\"lightsaber\">laser sword</a>, of course. Figuring out these combinations and using them is more entertaining than just about anything the story missions have to offer. As you level up and scour the world, you'll acquire combo cards that tell you what things can be combined and, if you have the card, you'll get twice as many prestige points, which is the game's equivalent to experience points.<br/> <br/> The PC version of Dead Rising 2 looks the best and has the most resolution options. It also has <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2452\" href=\"/games-for-windows-live/3015-2452/\" slug=\"games-for-windows-live\">Games For Windows Live</a> support, which is nice for fans of Microsoft's achievement system. The Xbox 360 version of the game has some fairly noticeable drops in frame rate, but still looks just fine most of the time. The 360 version also lets you import your level (up to level five) from the downloadable prequel, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30018\" href=\"/dead-rising-2-case-zero/3030-30018/\" slug=\"dead-rising-2-case-zero\">Case Zero</a>. This will give you a bit of a head start in the 360 version, but getting through those first five levels doesn't take very long at all. So PS3 and PC owners that can't import characters aren't really missing out on much.<br/> <br/> Money isn't really much of an object in Dead Rising 2, anyway. The game has a multiplayer mode based on the reality violence show that opens the single-player. It's essentially a four-player minigame collection that involves various ways to murder zombies. Money earned in ranked games can be funneled back into your single-player saves, but beyond that, the minigames aren't much fun and shouldn't be considered a primary draw. The game also has online co-op, letting players jump into your single-player game and assist. This is a fun option, especially for the joining player, since it isn't your playthrough. Time has less of a meaning when you're not messing up your own save, so you can just freely follow the host player and bust heads at will. But the design of the co-op feels like it fell out of a PlayStation 2 game. Joining players also play as Chuck Greene, and the story's cutscenes don't evolve to account for the second player, either. It makes the whole thing feel a little thrown together.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1470173-dead_rising_2_2010_08_18_10_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470173\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1470173-dead_rising_2_2010_08_18_10_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470173\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1470173-dead_rising_2_2010_08_18_10_08.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1470173-dead_rising_2_2010_08_18_10_08.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> You'll have a lot of options for changing--or removing your clothes.</figcaption></figure>     The groans of the zombie horde and the sound effects when you clobber them with your various items are all very well done. Splattering zombies with a blunt object sounds appropriately wet and disgusting. The cutscenes usually have pretty good dialogue, though for a game set in Nevada, it's easy to hear Canadian speech mannerisms coming out of the characters here and there. That's not inherently bad, but it sure serves as a constant reminder that most of the heavy lifting for Dead Rising 2's development was done in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2523\" href=\"/vancouver/3035-2523/\" slug=\"vancouver\">Vancouver</a>, not <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1371\" href=\"/osaka/3035-1371/\" slug=\"osaka\">Osaka</a>.<br/><br/> Dead Rising 2's kooky structure and occasionally open nature gives it a lot of appeal across many different types of players, but the people who truly love Dead Rising 2 will all have a few things in common. They'll appreciate a challenge, even when it seems like you're occasionally fighting the game mechanics, rather than the boss fight. They'll enjoy playing through a game multiple times, each with a slightly different objective. And they'll probably enjoy running through thousands upon thousands of easy-to-kill zombies. It's also very divisive. Plenty of people will hate the way the game uses time to force a layer of tension onto everything they do. Others will hate the lack of an autosave system, even though adding one of those would inherently change the entire game. Me, I wish the game had better inventory control and an item storage system to allow you to really explore all of your weapon options. But it's the other stuff--the still messy survivor AI and poorly built boss battles--that really mars the Dead Rising 2 experience.

Claptrap's New Robot Revolution adds new zones and a new main quest line that pits you against enemies new and old as you attempt to stop the friendly little robots from rising up and taking over the planet of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-156\" href=\"/pandora/3035-156/\" slug=\"pandora\">Pandora</a>. It's an appropriate amount of content for the money, and if you're at all interested in continuing to play Borderlands, you should certainly pick it up.<br/> <br/> The New Robot Revolution takes you to Tartarus Station, a new hub-type zone where Hyperion representatives are attempting to stop the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4591\" href=\"/claptrap/3015-4591/\" slug=\"claptrap\">Claptrap</a>--which they created--from taking over the entire planet. Since you and your treasure hunting posse are the most effective killing machines in town, you're quickly contracted to deal with the threat.<br/> <br/> That threat has led to the robot forces infecting a lot of the standard enemies you'd normally find in the game, which translates to a lot of standard enemies with vacuum tubes sticking out of their heads. So you'll still fight <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3930\" href=\"/skag/3015-3930/\" slug=\"skag\">skags</a>, spider-ants, bandits, and even a few bosses, like a Trapped-up version of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-14034\" href=\"/general-knoxx/3005-14034/\" slug=\"general-knoxx\">General Knoxx</a>. You'll actually fight this new Knoxx twice, which is perhaps a bit much. The downside to all of this is that most of the enemies are new in name and appearance only, so the standard combat tactics of running backwards while shooting as much as possible still apply. You will fight actual claptraps, though, which can get a little tricky. The \"Divine Wind\" variants just sort of roll up beside you and explode, which gives you something new to worry about. There's also that boss fight at the end, which is appropriately dramatic and one of the cooler things to appear in any part of Borderlands.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1546101-bandit_express.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1546101\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1546101-bandit_express.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1546101\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1546101-bandit_express.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Oh, and there's also a train full of robo-bandits to deal with.</figcaption></figure>     The developers have also made the game's quests feel like they matter a bit more than they have in the past by adding more speech. When you take on quests, the characters you're interacting with give you a bit of a monologue about what they're asking you to do and why. If you're the \"run to map dot and kill stuff\" sort of guy, you can just take off, but it makes the other characters in the world feel like they matter a bit more, which is cool.<br/> <br/> The catch is that it all feels a little short and it was released ahead of an upcoming patch that will increase the level cap by eight and rebalance the old content to account for players that may be as high as level 69. Playing through this DLC before the release of the patch made the whole thing feel a little hollow, knowing that I'd probably have to replay large sections of it to gain levels once it's out there. The patch is due to be released ahead of a Game of the Year edition of Borderlands, which is due out on 10/12, so if you're planning on playing this new DLC, I'd recommend you wait until that patch is available so you'll get more than a couple of bonus skill points.<br/> <br/> But if you're absolutely fiending for more Borderlands, it's not entirely empty without that character progression. The new quests and areas, combined with a \"best of\" lineup of characters from the other DLCs and other parts from the main game make for a good, exciting mini-adventure.

A fair amount of Hollywood talent got involved in this game--the story is by <i><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/sunshine/16-192975/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunshine</a></i> and <i><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-beach/16-195042/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Beach</a></i> writer <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/alex-garland/14-182944/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex Garland</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/andy-serkis/14-444137/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andy Serkis</a> (<i><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring/16-173020/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>' <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9177\" href=\"/gollum/3005-9177/\" slug=\"gollum\">Gollum</a>) directed the dramatic sequences and voiced the main character--and they earn their places in the credits as you see nuanced, believable relationships building between Enslaved's tiny cast of speaking characters over the course of their grueling journey. The game's mix of melee combat and acrobatic platforming satisfies more often than not, but even when the gameplay gets awkward, the plight of the survivors is engaging and touching enough to drive you onward to the story's conclusion.  <br/> <br/><a data-ref-id=\"3005-16479\" href=\"/monkey/3005-16479/\" slug=\"monkey\">Monkey</a> is a capable, muscled nomad making his solitary way through the wastes. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16505\" href=\"/trip/3005-16505/\" slug=\"trip\">Trip</a> is a technically adept but fragile young girl stranded hundreds of miles from her secluded farming community. She needs to safely cover those miles and elude roving bands of killer robots, the remnants of the war that destroyed civilization. She needs Monkey. So she secretly fits him with a mind-control device that forces him to obey her commands and will administer a killing shock to him, if she dies. Naturally this fierce loner isn't too thrilled about obeying orders from an excitable teenager, but what choice does he have? It quickly becomes apparent that while Trip is technically in control of the situation, Monkey's the one with both the brawn and the survival know-how, and that creates some good tension and an almost playful back-and-forth dynamic between the two, as they scrape through frequent close encounters with the mechs, and learn more about each other in the process.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1547740-resize_of_highres_screenshot_000208.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1547740\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1547740-resize_of_highres_screenshot_000208.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1547740\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1547740-resize_of_highres_screenshot_000208.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The game hits you with cinematic action sequences on a regular basis.</figcaption></figure>     The game's dramatic scenes are among the most convincing in the business, utilizing Serkis' obvious flair for the dramatic, and the \"performance capture\" process made famous by <i><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/avatar/16-127095/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avatar</a>,</i> to fill Monkey, Trip, and the game's one other meaningful speaking character with more lifelike personality and pathos than a dozen text-heavy role-playing games. Technically that's because there are actual people behind not just the voiceover (which is superb) but also the body language, facial tics, and zillion other subtle elements that make these characters seem quite real. Performance capture must still be a pretty expensive or unwieldy process, otherwise every developer would use it in their cutscenes all the time. The results speak for themselves. Even outside the cinematics, the game does a great job of developing its characters, owing to the snappy and genuinely funny banter between them, and I realized I honestly cared about what was going to happen to them only an hour or two into the game.<br/> <br/> Actually playing Enslaved is largely like bouncing between <a data-ref-id=\"3025-431\" href=\"/prince-of-persia/3025-431/\" slug=\"prince-of-persia\">Prince of Persia</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-244\" href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" slug=\"god-of-war\">God of War</a>. From a crumbling, heavily jungled <a data-ref-id=\"3035-109\" href=\"/new-york-city/3035-109/\" slug=\"new-york-city\">New York City</a> to a mechanized facility run by the slavers who are trying to subjugate what's left of society, there's a lot of stuff to climb on. The game subscribes to the hold-your-hand school of acrobatic traversal, since it marks only certain background elements--loose bricks, conveniently placed poles and ledges--as climbable, and all you need to do is push the stick toward the next handhold and press the jump button. In general I have no problem with letting a game take the lead with this sort of mechanic; the weird angles and irregular spacing of the jumps you have to make would probably be a nightmare to accomplish with looser, manual gamepad controls. Though, if you're looking for a constant challenge, this isn't it; the platforming rarely demands expert timing from you, and only a few of these sequences near the end of the game really put you under any sort of time pressure. It's easy to do, but at least it looks really cool while you're doing it.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1547741-resize_of_highres_screenshot_000068.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1547741\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1547741-resize_of_highres_screenshot_000068.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1547741\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1547741-resize_of_highres_screenshot_000068.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1547741-resize_of_highres_screenshot_000068.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Mech-ridden wasteland America is a pretty ugly place.</figcaption></figure>     The melee combat involving Monkey and his weird electro-retractable futuristic staff weapon is more challenging and consequently more satisfying. You've got a healthy assortment of light and heavy attacks, dodges, counters, and blocks, and the game does a good job of smoothly introducing stronger and trickier foes throughout the game that come at you in different ways and force you to actually use your entire arsenal of moves to defeat them. Monkey's staff also doubles as a sort of rifle that can fire both stunning and killing energy blasts from a third-person view, and there are enemies that make you mix in these ranged attacks as well. Monkey even has a hoverboard of sorts that comes into play in a few action sequences and boss fights.  <br/> <br/>Lastly, there's an AI-only co-op mechanic that lets Trip pitch in and help you out when you ask for it. She can project a hologram to draw the mechs' fire away from you for a short time so you can run from one cover point to the next, and you can also pop up from behind cover and yell at them to draw their ire back your way, so you can tell her to move up to your position. Per action genre standards, there are multiple upgrade paths that let you enhance your fighting prowess, ranged attacks, health, and so on. I found the game did a good job of varying up the sorts of combat and action scenarios I was getting into so I never got bored with what was happening at the moment.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1547745-highres_screenshot_0060.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1547745\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1547745-highres_screenshot_0060.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1547745\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1547745-highres_screenshot_0060.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1547745-highres_screenshot_0060.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Step two in the \"Body By Monkey\" workout program.</figcaption></figure>Enslaved has the appearance of being entirely original, but it's actually based on the classical Chinese narrative <i>Journey to the West</i> and places some specific narrative threads from that work into its distinctive setting to create its own identity. And though the post-apocalyptic thing has been done to death in video games recently, this game has a unique take on that theme. It brings together a lot of elements, the visual design and tone of the characters chief among them, to create a vision of a shattered future that doesn't feel exactly like every other wasteland you've seen before. I really enjoyed the dirty, clockwork look of all the technology left over from the war; it's got a sort of retro-futuristic vibe to it, and the mech designs are all fearsome in an animalistic sort of way. In basic terms of color palette and art style, it's a rich and beautiful-looking game, though a few frame rate drops and the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-86\" href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" slug=\"unreal-engine-3\">Unreal Engine</a>'s characteristic texture pop-in don't do it any favors. The game has a penchant for larger-than-life cinematic action sequences, such as an escape from a crashing airship or a battle on top of a skyscraper-sized mech, that really showcase not just the graphical fidelity but also the designs of the technology and architecture that sprung up in this game's world, centuries after the gears of modern society and industry ground to a halt.<br/> <br/> Enslaved comes right at the start of the busy fourth-quarter release schedule, and given the game's modest promotional campaign up to now, this review might be the first you've heard of it. But it's a well-produced effort that makes itself easy to get invested in and is worth considering for anyone who enjoys a solid dozen-hour-long, story-driven action game. It doesn't do everything right all the time, but some grander and higher-profile games could stand to learn a lesson or two from this one.    ", "deck": "Deeply engaging characters and mostly solid action combine in Ninja Theory's latest effort.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-320/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-28080/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/3030-28080/", "id": 28080, "name": "Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-10-06 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-94583/", "id": 94583, "name": "Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/guitar-hero-warriors-of-rock-review/1900-321/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99198/1452475-guitar_hero_warriors_of_rock___3_highways.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452475\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99198/1452475-guitar_hero_warriors_of_rock___3_highways.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452475\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99198/1452475-guitar_hero_warriors_of_rock___3_highways.jpg\"></a><figcaption> THAT'S what Guitar Hero was missing.

The slow death of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-289\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\" slug=\"guitar-hero\">Guitar Hero</a> is something that bums me out personally. I have a lot of fond memories with this series, and it speaks volumes that, despite bringing little to the table besides a half-baked story mode and a fresh set of metal-heavy songs, there were still flickers of the old Guitar Hero magic--that spontaneous realization of your secret rock star--while playing Warriors of Rock. But without any significant new features over last year's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24711\" href=\"/guitar-hero-5/3030-24711/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-5\">Guitar Hero 5</a>, the returns are diminishing at an alarming rate, and the only meaningful metric remaining is how much you like the soundtrack.<br/> <br/> This is, for the most part, Guitar Hero As Usual. You'll find basic feature parity with Guitar Hero 5. You've got quickplay, party play, competitive modes, some online options, and a training section, plus a character creator and the still-shoddy GHTunes music maker suite. But Warriors of Rock ditches the usual rags-to-riches rock fantasy career mode with a quest mode that's similar in structure, but that fully embraces the corny, kid-safe cartoonishness that has been creeping into Guitar Hero for the past few years. I'm reminded of the junior-high heavy-metal fantasy of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20700\" href=\"/brutal-legend/3030-20700/\" slug=\"brutal-legend\">Brutal Legend</a>, but in an entirely perfunctory way. <br/> <br/> Acting as the agents of the imprisoned Demigod of Rock, each level has you playing as one of the familiar faces from prior Guitar Hero games--characters like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-796\" href=\"/johnny-napalm/3005-796/\" slug=\"johnny-napalm\">Johnny Napalm</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-763\" href=\"/judy-nails/3005-763/\" slug=\"judy-nails\">Judy Nails</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-780\" href=\"/axel-steel/3005-780/\" slug=\"axel-steel\">Axel Steel</a>--as well as a few new ones. While in the quest mode, each character also has some kind of unique gameplay modifier that usually effects score multipliers or your star power meter, an effect that's amplified once you complete that character's setlist and they transform into some kind of zombie or cyborg or demon beast or whatever.  It's supposed to be all tough and metal, but it's just silly. The best comparison I can conjure is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pch_77AX08\" rel=\"nofollow\">the old Harlem Globetrotters cartoon</a>, where the clown princes of basketball were turned into half-assed superheroes with flimsy gimmicks derived loosely from their personas. When it takes a left-turn into the realm of prog-rock with Rush's <i>2112</i> halfway through, it seems like a non-sequitur, and by the time it got to the Megadeth-driven grand finale, I had long since stopped caring.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99198/1452477-guitar_hero_warriors_of_rock___demi_god_of_rock.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452477\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99198/1452477-guitar_hero_warriors_of_rock___demi_god_of_rock.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452477\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99198/1452477-guitar_hero_warriors_of_rock___demi_god_of_rock.jpg\"></a><figcaption> I ask you, who is this for?     </figcaption></figure>     So I wasn't particularly receptive to the comic-book charms of the quest mode, but I found it incredibly helpful in making sense of the game's soundtrack, which, if just presented as a big alphabetical list of 93 songs, looks like random madness. In the quest mode, though, each character's setlist generally matches their basic theme, so when you're playing as punk-rock stereotype Johnny Napalm, you get songs by The Buzzcocks, Twisted Sister, The Runaways, The Offspring, Sum 41, Bad Brains, Soundgarden, and The Ramones. It's not always perfect, but it's a smart way to present the music in a game like this, though I definitely hit a brick wall a little bit past the halfway point in the quest mode, when all of the characters I could select seemed to trade mostly in the kind of dirge-y heavy metal sludge that I have very little personal interest in.<br/> <br/> More than anything, your interest in the songs featured in Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock will dictate its value to you. For me, personally, there are a good dozen or so songs in here that I both enjoy listening to and had a blast playing, including “Uprising” by Muse, “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen, “Been Caught Stealing” by Jane's Addition, and “Money for Nothing” by Dire Straits. But I probably would've been happier, and would've spent significantly less money, had I been able to pick up these songs as downloadable content. Then again, if you've already invested in previous Guitar Hero games--including <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20673\" href=\"/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-world-tour\">Guitar Hero World Tour</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25521\" href=\"/guitar-hero-smash-hits/3030-25521/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-smash-hits\">Guitar Hero: Smash Hits</a>, Guitar Hero 5, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26367\" href=\"/band-hero/3030-26367/\" slug=\"band-hero\">Band Hero</a>--it's relatively cheap and easy to import the songs from those games into Warriors of Rock, giving you hundreds of songs to choose from.<br/> <br/> That Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock is most compelling as a track pack suggests that this is a series that has already peaked, and it's hard not to draw comparisons to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-10\" href=\"/tony-hawk/3025-10/\" slug=\"tony-hawk\">the last franchise</a> that developer Neversoft had to grind out year after year. Warriors of Rock offers a minor facelift but ignores the sagging infrastructure, and it's not a direction that holds much of a future for Guitar Hero.  ", "deck": "The underlying formula and a handful of good songs still provide some bright moments, but Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock feels all too obligatory to be very exciting.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-321/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30014/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/guitar-hero-warriors-of-rock/3030-30014/", "id": 30014, "name": "Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2010-10-05 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-102224/", "id": 102224, "name": "Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/comic-jumper-review/1900-322/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/83365/1400418-comicjumperscreen1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1400418\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56200941915228\" data-width=\"637\" style=\"width: 637px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/83365/1400418-comicjumperscreen1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1400418\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83365/1400418-comicjumperscreen1.jpg\"></a><figcaption> This is an unedited gameplay screenshot of Comic Jumper.</figcaption></figure>     There are terrific things in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28047\" href=\"/comic-jumper/3030-28047/\" slug=\"comic-jumper\">Comic Jumper</a>. It's astoundingly absurd and, at times, absolutely hilarious. It's a game that reaches <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16647\" href=\"/amped-3/3030-16647/\" slug=\"amped-3\">Amped 3</a> levels of FMV-laced madness, and if you've seen the cutscenes and story in Amped 3, you know that this is not faint praise. But there's a catch in <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6415\" href=\"/twisted-pixel-games/3010-6415/\" slug=\"twisted-pixel-games\">Twisted Pixel</a>'s latest <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">Xbox Live Arcade</a> release. Actually playing Comic Jumper can be something of a chore. It's ambitious in spots, with a lot of surface variety, but once you've seen its few tricks, the gameplay's repetitive nature really starts to grind against the great sense of humor.<br/><br/>The real premise behind Comic Jumper is fantastic. Faced with a poor performance in his own comic book, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12186\" href=\"/captain-smiley/3005-12186/\" slug=\"captain-smiley\">Captain Smiley</a>--a bulky superhero with a smiley face for a head and a wise-cracked star named Star on his chest--finds himself canceled. In order to make ends meet and prove his worth for an eventual relaunch, he'll have to guest star in other comics to earn money for his comeback. Additionally, Twisted Pixel--that's the company that developed the game--buys the rights to Captain Smiley, making him an employee of the game's developer. This ends up leading to everything getting incredibly self-aware, with plenty of opportunities for the characters to directly reference the game's development and, as has become something of a Twisted Pixel trademark, a lot of terrific live-action video. It's almost as if the developer took the wildest parts of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26355\" href=\"/splosion-man/3030-26355/\" slug=\"splosion-man\">'Splosion Man</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23112\" href=\"/the-maw/3030-23112/\" slug=\"the-maw\">The Maw</a> and expanded it all into an entire game.<br/><br/>It's funny, the writing is strong, and it also has a great visual style. What starts out as a fairly generic modern comic look quickly gives way to three additional styles. The fantasy style '70s comic, Nanoc the Obliviator, has an appropriately desaturated look and lots of fur boots, evil birds, and... uh... golf balls. It makes sense in context. After three levels of that, you'll move onto a silver age style, where \"invisible\" ropes are clearly seen as dashed lines and a governing body attempts to maintain moral standards by fining you every time Star decides to swear. Things really go off the rails after that with a manga style, which, cleverly, has you moving from right to left instead of left to right. Smiley takes on a Cloud Strife sort of look in the manga style, and jokes are made about how the game's creators probably didn't bother to do much actual research into the source material before writing a bunch of easy, yet great material, all of which is well-delivered by a pretty seasoned voice cast.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72812/1504207-comic_jumper_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1504207\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72812/1504207-comic_jumper_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1504207\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/72812/1504207-comic_jumper_8.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The manga art style gets especially delirious. </figcaption></figure>     All of that good, fun comedy makes it a little easier to get past Comic Jumper's weakness: it isn't much fun to actually play. The action rotates through a few different basic concepts, but the majority of the game is a sort of dual-joystick platformer/shooter, where you use the right analog stick to aim at targets and can also jump or slide. The controls are mostly mapped to the triggers and bumpers, to make things easy to manipulate. But the action is very basic. Enemies fly or run onto the screen, you aim at them, they eventually blow up, you move on. Many of your foes soak up way too many bullets before falling, even if you've upgraded your attack power. Some of them shoot back, forcing you to jump or run out of the way, but that's about it. Occasionally the game will break into a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">Quick Time Event</a>, a flying stage, an extremely dry melee system, or something reminiscent of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11134\" href=\"/cabal/3030-11134/\" slug=\"cabal\">Cabal</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-461\" href=\"/panzer-dragoon/3025-461/\" slug=\"panzer-dragoon\">Panzer Dragoon</a>, where you control an on-screen reticle to aim at enemies while also dodging incoming projectiles. The game is certainly ambitious, and it's cool that it manages to switch styles on the fly, but with no one type of gameplay feeling particularly exciting, it all seems a little academic. At times it can get challenging, but a lot of that is muted when you play the game as a slightly slower pace, so as long as you're upgrading your abilities frequently and aren't just blindly running into enemies, it's never impossible.<br/><br/>But middling gameplay isn't enough to stop Comic Jumper. While I found myself disappointed with portions of the game, the sense of humor and green-screen madness on display make Comic Jumper something much, much more than a basic platformer, and it's this aspect of the game that makes it relatively easy to recommend.    ", "deck": "Comic Jumper isn't a great game, but it's such a hilarious one that it's still worth seeing from start to finish.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-322/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-28047/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/comic-jumper/3030-28047/", "id": 28047, "name": "Comic Jumper"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-10-05 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-104039/", "id": 104039, "name": "Comic Jumper"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/def-jam-rapstar-review/1900-323/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1512368-lil__jon__get_low____def_jam_rapstar_solo_gameplay_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1512368\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"1360\" style=\"width: 1360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1512368-lil__jon__get_low____def_jam_rapstar_solo_gameplay_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1512368\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1512368-lil__jon__get_low____def_jam_rapstar_solo_gameplay_screen.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Earn points for shouting 'skeet skeet skeet' into a microphone!</figcaption></figure>     If you love hip-hop, the rise of the rhythm game genre has probably been a real bummer. Hip-hop doesn't make much sense for something like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-289\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\" slug=\"guitar-hero\">Guitar Hero</a>, and the token inclusions in games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1333\" href=\"/lips/3025-1333/\" slug=\"lips\">Lips</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-351\" href=\"/singstar/3025-351/\" slug=\"singstar\">SingStar</a> are usually focused on crossover karaoke \"favorites\" like Will Smith, MC Hammer, and Young MC. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26656\" href=\"/def-jam-rapstar/3030-26656/\" slug=\"def-jam-rapstar\">Def Jam Rapstar</a>, however, is focused squarely on the genre, with a disc full of tracks that cover a lot of territory and time and a set of features that puts it on par with Sony's karaoke series, with plenty of potential to grow beyond that if the developer's aspirations for the official website come to fruition.<br/> <br/> First thing's first, though. I don't need to tell you that if you don't like hip-hop music, Def Jam Rapstar isn't for you. But I do need to tell you that, even if you love the music, excelling at Def Jam Rapstar requires a familiarity with the material that many other rhythm games don't demand. In Guitar Hero or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">Rock Band</a>, you can sight-read songs and plunk them out on a guitar--even songs you hate can actually be fun to play. SingStar, or singing in a band game, definitely takes things up a step, but if you can fake the melody and know the chorus, you can usually make it through a lot of pop and rock music. Rapping benefits from the rhythm of a drummer, understanding of breath control (like when to breathe and when to just keep rapping), and, to some extent, knowledge of the song. I was able to fumble my way through a few songs that I wasn't all that familiar with, but if you want to do well and have fun doing so, you'll want to spend time either listening to the songs outside of the game or messing around in the game's practice mode to figure out how the rhymes flow. Otherwise you're just going to mumble your way through songs, which gets boring fast.<br/> <br/> There's a career mode and a progression to Def Jam Rapstar, where you work your way through five stages of songs, earning up to five mics (read: stars) per song and unlocking a few additional songs and challenges along the way. It's sort of unfortunate that some of the songs, like Rob Base &amp; DJ EZ-Rock's \"It Takes Two\" or <a data-ref-id=\"3040-72815\" href=\"/busta-rhymes/3040-72815/\" slug=\"busta-rhymes\">Busta Rhymes</a>' \"Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See\" are locked at the get-go, since it forces you to go through a lot of songs that you may or may not like.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1512363-dj_premier__go_back____def_jam_rapstar_freestyle_mode_beat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1512363\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"1360\" style=\"width: 1360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1512363-dj_premier__go_back____def_jam_rapstar_freestyle_mode_beat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1512363\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1512363-dj_premier__go_back____def_jam_rapstar_freestyle_mode_beat.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can turn on various vocal effects while you rap. Turn them all on at once for maximum raposity. </figcaption></figure>     Party mode is the freeform \"hey, let's just rap for awhile\" mode, and you can set up playlists of multiple songs or just go at them one at a time. You're welcome to go at it alone, but the game's better when you're playing with someone else, either in a battle mode, where both players perform the entire song simultaneously to see who does a better job, or in a duet mode, where players trade verses and earn a combined score. The game keeps online leaderboards, but ideally, the best way to find out how good you are is to get online. The game doesn't have any pure online competition, but you can take 30-second clips of your performances--helpfully recorded by an Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation Eye, or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\" href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" slug=\"kinect-support\">Kinect</a>--slap a bunch of video effects on them, and upload them to a central server. Once there, other players can view the videos from inside the game or via the game's official website, effectively letting you share your videos with people who don't even own the game. <br/> <br/>The developer's plans for the official website are ambitious, but in its current state, it doesn't do much beyond letting you view videos and battle other users by selecting one of your uploaded videos and having your opponent do the same. Battles are done via user voting, which encourages the combatants to get all Web 2.0 with it and blast the video out to Facebook or Twitter, both of which are integrated into the site. But the site currently lacks a lot of basic features, sorting videos barely works, profile pages don't seem to actually list the videos uploaded by that user, and so on. Granted, the site is listed as a \"beta\" and will probably improve, but right now it's not quite the draw that it could be.<br/> <br/> There are also some issues with the way the songs are presented. For starters, this is a T-rated game, so the songs are presented in an edited format. Actually, they're presented as music videos, which is pretty cool, since there are some classic music videos to be had here. But considering rap videos' penchant for breaking out of the song for a bit for a quick skit, the videos occasionally get in the way of the actual gameplay. While you're waiting for Diddy and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98304\" href=\"/ben-stiller/3040-98304/\" slug=\"ben-stiller\">Ben Stiller</a> to shut up, you're also losing the tempo of the song a bit, making it a bit rougher to come back in than it needs to be. You can hit a button on the controller to skip long sections of non-gameplay, which is nice, but it also shines a pretty bright light on the fact that a lot of rap videos have a lot of filler in them. Also, a few of the songs are just ill-suited for the format. Salt 'n' Pepa's \"Push It\" is certainly a classic, but shouting \"Ah... push it\" into a microphone over and over again while occasionally breaking into some of the most insipid lyrics of all time only serves to remind you that \"Push It\" is actually a terrible song. It's like Def Jam Rapstar just robbed me of some of my youth or something. Some tracks also could have been broken up a bit better in duet mode, also, as songs like \"Brass Monkey\" by the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3952\" href=\"/ad-rock/3005-3952/\" slug=\"ad-rock\">Beastie Boys</a> switch players in less-than-natural-sounding spots. You're also asked to sing the hooks on some songs, often immediately after finishing up a full verse, giving you no breaks at all--something that even the original artists don't do, since you're usually performing the lyrics of two or more artists. Some of the track-specific issues are offset by an already-healthy amount of DLC tracks, and it sounds like the plan is to add more tracks on a weekly basis.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1512362-busta_rhymes__put_your_hands_where_my_eyes_can_see___def_jam_rapstar_solo_gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1512362\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"1360\" style=\"width: 1360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1512362-busta_rhymes__put_your_hands_where_my_eyes_can_see___def_jam_rapstar_solo_gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1512362\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1512362-busta_rhymes__put_your_hands_where_my_eyes_can_see___def_jam_rapstar_solo_gameplay.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1512362-busta_rhymes__put_your_hands_where_my_eyes_can_see___def_jam_rapstar_solo_gameplay.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Flow with the bouncing ball.</figcaption></figure>     In addition to all of the existing material, Def Jam Rapstar also comes with a collection of all-new instrumentals for use in the game's freestyle mode. Obviously, the game can't score you on your freestyles, so this is strictly useful for the game's video sharing component. The variety in the freestyle tracks is pretty good, with a range of tempos for you to employ. You can also choose to go with no backing track at all, but it would have been nice to see some sort of music import feature, to allow people to use their own tracks.<br/> <br/>Some of the trimming around the outer edges is shaky, but the core of Def Jam Rapstar is rock-solid, and the community video feature is sure to provide a lot of entertainment on its own.

It also delivers a multiplayer component that feels like it's desperately trying to split the difference between <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24713\" href=\"/modern-warfare-2/3030-24713/\" slug=\"modern-warfare-2\"> Modern Warfare 2</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25246\" href=\"/battlefield-bad-company-2/3030-25246/\" slug=\"battlefield-bad-company-2\"> Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a>. There are flashes of excitement peppered across the game's modes, but it's hard to get too excited about any of that when it's been done better elsewhere.<br/> <br/> The campaign is set during a two-day period in Afghanistan. You'll jump between a few different perspectives over the course of the story, but you're typically running around the battlefield with three AI-controlled allies by your side, and they'll do all the talking. The game essentially leads you from one messed-up situation to the next as the various teams you'll spend time with get themselves into and back out of trouble on Afghan mountains. There really isn't much of a \"story\" to Medal of Honor's campaign. Aside from a nosy general who's (poorly) calling shots from thousands of miles away, the antagonists are mostly faceless. So you'll spend four to six hours shooting your way through countless hordes of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces, and then watch the end credits. Considering the game is at least loosely based on real-world events, it's unrealistic to expect some kind of big boss fight or some kind of central villain that you're trying to find and kill, but as it stands, the events of Medal of Honor completely lack impact and the whole thing feels like the middle third of a three-act story.<br/> <br/> The gameplay in Medal of Honor's single-player component is roughly what you'd expect from a modern military shooter. On consoles, you'll pull the left trigger to aim down the sights and the right trigger to fire. The game will snap your aim to enemy targets if you aim down the sights while aiming roughly in their direction, which makes taking them down fairly easy, but overall, the game makes firing a weapon satisfying enough. Though you can collect weapons from the enemy, you can also ask any of your buddies for a refill if you're running low. This results in an unsightly \"press (square) to request ammo\" prompt whenever you get close to one of your guys.  <br/> <br/>Though you can sort of play the game however you like, Medal of Honor's campaign feels heavily scripted, and I ran into multiple situations where the scripting gets in the way of the action, making a lot of the action feel very sloppy. I had one case where a door that was supposed to be open simply wasn't, causing one of my allies to clip right through the unopened door while I was stuck and forced to reload my last checkpoint. Another such situation left me stuck inside a small house, blocked in by an ally that was standing in the doorway and refusing to move. In another case, an enemy hung near the back of the immediate area, refusing to come forward to pop out to fight. When I took off in search of the enemy, my AI allies immediately started scolding me, talking about how we need to stick together... but they weren't exactly moving forward to find this guy, either.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9712/1426129-mohmpgame_2010_07_05_16_44_32_55.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1426129\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9712/1426129-mohmpgame_2010_07_05_16_44_32_55.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1426129\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9712/1426129-mohmpgame_2010_07_05_16_44_32_55.png\"></a><figcaption>The dot-matrix display style for the multiplayer HUD is one of Medal of Honor's cooler ideas. </figcaption></figure>     Not to get all \"laundry list\" with this scripting stuff, but I was left with quite a few specific examples after one playthrough. Another part of the game has you and one of your guys waiting for a group to separate before moving forward, undetected. After messing it up the first time, I decided to play it properly and wait. But my AI guy never moved forward, even after the guys separated. After waiting for 10 minutes... and then reloading the checkpoint six or seven times with the same result, it all just sort of snapped back into place and worked as intended. Later on, your team is surrounding a campfire with a number of soldiers around it. As you're gunning them all down, another one pops out of nowhere and slams a bottle down on the fire and starts shooting. The smoke coming from the fire signifies to the enemy that something has gone wrong, sort of blowing your cover. Assuming this was because I let that guy break his bottle, I reloaded and attempted to get him and remain stealthy. But that's not possible, because the guy is completely invincible until after he's tossed that bottle. I understand that some things have to be scripted in order to make the story go in a certain direction, but this sequence really pulls back the curtain and broke any sense of immersion the game had built up until that point. The gritty soldier talk and basic action feel fine, but when it's surrounded by all of these issues, it becomes very hard to care about any of it.<br/> <br/> But then, it's entirely possible that Medal of Honor is built as a multiplayer game first and a single-player game second. After all, the back of the box touts \"multiplayer developed by the creators of Battlefield\" at the very top, making it the first thing you see when you flip the box over. The split development makes Medal of Honor feel like two different games, but that doesn't quite work out to some kind of mythical \"two games for the price of one\" deal.<br/> <br/> The multiplayer side of Medal of Honor feels like DICE took the action of Battlefield: Bad Company 2, streamlined bits of it to focus more on shooting and less on support roles, sped the whole thing up a bit, and placed most of the action on smaller maps. Some aspects from the single-player game, like the way you can reload early to keep one bullet in the chamber, or the ability to go prone or slide into cover by hitting duck while running, aren't present at all. It's a weird disconnect that's unfortunate, because those features are neat additions that would have added to the multiplayer experience and helped give the game a feel of its own. Instead it feels caught between the fast, loose style of Modern Warfare 2 and the somewhat more surgical class-based play of Bad Company 2. While it's totally competent, there are a few instances of invisible walls on the multiplayer maps that just seem like totally boneheaded errors. Also, the things you unlock as you level up the game's three classes are real yawners. With 15 levels per class, it's a waste to have one or two levels just give you the enemy team's statistically identical weapons.<br/> <br/> You'll take those weapons and character classes into a few different modes, like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\"> team deathmatch</a>, a zone control mode, and a couple of objective-based modes that put one team on the attack while the other tries to prevent bombs from being planted on their gear. Combat mission, which has the attacking team work its way through five bomb sites while the defenders try to exhaust the other team's ticket supply, feels the most directly like Battlefield. These matches take place on larger maps and you'll even see a vehicle or two. The rest take place on smaller maps that feel more appropriate for the action. Regardless of the mode, you earn points with every kill, and putting together a streak of kills will allow you to call in support powers, like a UAV, mortar and missile strikes, or on-the-fly armor and ammo upgrades for your entire team. The flak jackets and match ammo are pretty interesting, since they'll benefit your entire team and last for each player until he dies. Of course, you need to be good enough to actually string some kills together, as your points reset after every death.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1468979-moh_screen_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468979\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1468979-moh_screen_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468979\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1468979-moh_screen_24.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1468979-moh_screen_24.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> In one spot, you'll work the guns on a helicopter, giving you plenty of chances to blow things up.</figcaption></figure>     Most of Medal of Honor runs at what appears to be a solid 30 frames per second, though a couple of spots in the campaign dragged a bit. The best visual aspect of the game is probably its lighting. Seeing sunsets or fighting at dusk looks particularly nice, and in cases where there's no light at all, you can flip on your night vision for that green, electronic look. Some of the textures and shadows look a bit off, though, and some of the animation in the single-player game gets a little twitchy. Also, for all the time spent focusing on how these soldiers are so raw that they get to wear beards, you'd think that the in-game beards would look a little better. <br/> <br/>The audio across all modes is really fantastic, and is probably some of EA's best as far as shooters are concerned. Gunfire echoes around realistically, making the act of firing a weapon feel appropriately radical. Most of the voice-work is great, too, though I found the dialogue to get a little jargon-heavy at times. I shouldn't have to have watched a bunch of recent war movies just to know that CAS means \"close air support\" or that Delta Hotel means \"direct hit.\" Your mileage may vary on that stuff depending on your personal level of interest, but at times I felt like I needed a glossary, and had to stop to look things up online.<br/> <br/> Medal of Honor has some strong moments, but overall it feels like a game that could have been a lot better. Most of the issues I experienced while playing feel like things that could have--and should have--been avoided. But all of those scripting bugs and boring unlockables quickly add up, death-of-a-thousand-cuts style. In the absolutely ruthless world of online shooters, there's little room for weakness.

Not so much in real life...</figcaption></figure>     At the same time, something about Kirby's Epic Yarn transcends the  traditional notion of \"challenge\" as being a primary factor to make a  game worth playing. Developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6469\" href=\"/good-feel/3010-6469/\">     Good-Feel</a> (apt, very apt) has discovered something  slightly insidious here, harnessing the power of overwhelming cuteness  not just to create an endorphin-releasing visual experience, but to make  its gameplay somehow far more compelling than it seems like it really  ought to be, given its relative simplicity.<br /><br /> This thoroughly precious tale begins with a bit of storybook  introduction about <a data-ref-id=\"3005-726\" href=\"/kirby/3005-726/\">    Kirby's</a> latest predicament. One day, Kirby runs afoul  of a cranky sorcerer by the name of Yin-Yarn, who is, appropriately enough,  constructed entirely from yarn. After gobbling up Yin-Yarn's delicious Metamato  (as Kirby is often wont to do), Yin-Yarn angrily turns the tables on our  resident sucker-up of all things evil, and sucks Kirby into an  alternate dimension via a magical gym sock. Kirby awakens in a reality  in which the world around him \"feels like pants\" (the narrator's words, not mine),  as all of the world appears constructed out of various types of  patchwork materials. Much to his surprise, Kirby discovers that even his  body has gone the arts-and-crafts route, with his previously pudgy mass  replaced by outlines of pink and red yarn. <br /><br /> This sudden change in body mass also happens to rob our favorite walking  Dirt Devil of his powers of suction, meaning that Epic Yarn doesn't  really play quite the way that a typical Kirby platformer would. Now,  Kirby's primary weapon is a piece of wayward yarn he can toss in the  direction of enemies to either pull them apart or grab them, roll them  up into a ball of yarn, and toss as a projectile. More important than  that, though, is how Kirby's yarn arm comes into play as he hops and  jumps around each of the game's levels. Progression through the world  requires you to be aware of various dangling threads, loose buttons, and  other attachable linens scattered around each stage. Sometimes latching  onto one of these will simply provide Kirby a place to swing from, and  other times, it might unstitch a significant chunk of the  environment, revealing a new area to traverse. <br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405593-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405593\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405593-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405593\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/669/1405593-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_080.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Death from adorable!</figcaption></figure>     Half of the game's addictive quality comes from simply wanting to pull  at every random thread and button and patch that the game presents you  with. I won't sit here and pretend that that doesn't have quite a bit to  do with how unabashedly precious everything in this game is, because it  totally does. The visuals are, by any standard, delectable. The detail  that's gone into each and every piece of fabric woven into this game  world is entirely impressive, and at the same time, spine-meltingly  adorable. On top of all of that, Epic Yarn is one of those rare games  where visual presentation actually feeds your desire to keep playing.  Every world has its own unique, patchwork feel to it, and exploring each  stage not only offers up amusing visual treats (my particular favorite  being the game's definition of \"water,\" which is just blue yarn that you  swim around in), but ample opportunities for discovery as well.<br /><br /> Every stage is chock full of \"beads,\" little candy-colored gems that  practically beg to be collected. Many of these are hidden behind various  threads and buttons and zippers in each stage. The idea is to collect  enough beads in each level to earn yourself a gold medal--doing so  during boss fights even allows you to unlock additional hidden stages in  each game world. More to the point though, these beads are the game's  sole method of punishment for not playing well. Getting hit or falling  down a pit will cause you to lose almost embarrassing numbers of beads.  Maybe it's just my natural desire to collect every gleaming, shiny thing  in front of me, but every time I finished a level with sub-standard  bead numbers, I wanted to go back and play again. <br /><br /> There are also myriad rewards to collect, including various pieces of  furniture, and new musical tracks to play with. These furniture pieces  can be used in your own little apartment you get at the beginning of the  game, or you can place them in other apartments found in the complex. Doing so  will cause new people to move in, and each one of these new tenants  comes with a new minigame to play along with them (hide and seek, races,  etc.). These rewards are, arguably, the weakest part of the game,  unfortunately. The minigames are decent enough, but the stitched-in  <a data-ref-id=\"3025-32\" href=\"/animal-crossing/3025-32/\">   Animal Crossing</a> elements don't hold a great deal of sway. <br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405597-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_086.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405597\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405597-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_086.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405597\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/669/1405597-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_086.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/669/1405597-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_086.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The cuteness of that yarn dragon is melting my brain! I just want to hurrrrrrrrrrr...</figcaption></figure>     I haven't even gotten into Kirby's incredibly fun form-shifting  abilities (by entering vortexes found in certain stages, Kirby will  change into anything ranging from an acrobatic dolphin, to an off-road  racer, to an enormous, yarn-missile-launching tank) or the game's excellent  two-player functionality (a second player can take control of Prince Fluff, a cantankerous looking blue yarn creature that has all the same  abilities as Kirby), but at this point, I feel like rambling on too much  longer would rob you of the game's best quality--its feeling of  constant discovery. Every single time I found some new form Kirby could  take on, or encountered a new, aggressively cute world to explore, I  found myself with a big, doofy grin splayed across my face. <br /><br /> And that is what Kirby's Epic Yarn is all about.

It's not quite as torn up as some of the other wastelands you've seen in previous Fallout games, but there's still plenty of scrap and a lot of ill-tempered mutant creatures roaming around the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3054\" href=\"/mojave-desert/3035-3054/\">  Mojave</a> wastes. At the center of it all is New Vegas, a shining beacon of debauchery that, if it weren't for all the policing robots and rubble surrounding the big gates to the city's main strip, wouldn't feel too different from what 1950s Las Vegas probably felt like. Parts of the city are still obsessed with things like \"swinging\" and people like <a data-ref-id=\"3040-26697\" href=\"/elvis-presley/3040-26697/\">  Elvis Presley</a>. It's bright. It's gaudy. It's a great place to go if you're wealthy enough to handle the swings while gambling or just need to get out of the desert for a spell. But it's also under the control of an enigmatic man known as Mr. House. I probably don't need to tell you that this name was probably chosen specifically to allow for some uses of the phrase \"the House always wins.\"<br /><br /> But House isn't the only powerful faction in town. The surrounding areas are filled with soldiers from the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4845\" href=\"/new-california-republic/3015-4845/\">  New California Republic</a> and the huge tribe known as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4828\" href=\"/caesars-legion/3015-4828/\">  Caesar's Legion</a>.

You're down, but not out, and your entry into this world puts you on a collision course with the smiling, slick-talking hustler that gunned you down. As you'd expect, it quickly becomes more than just a simple revenge tale, and the fate of New Vegas swings in the balance as you decide which factions to work with and which ones to dispose of.<br /><br /> Along the way, you'll meet a lot of interesting characters. Mr. House, for one, is a great, mysterious presence. Caesar, leader of the Legion, is another--sure, his Legion is a bunch of slave-driving scum, but at least he's a learned man. The NCR is full of bureaucrats and soldiers, and they're probably the closest thing to modern society that you'll see in New Vegas. That also means that they aren't much fun. Deciding which faction to support in their quest to take Vegas is the focal point of the story, and it's the one that has the most impact on how it ends. There are also a lot of side quests, and some of these make for the game's best moments, though others feel a little slapped together. As in Fallout 3, New Vegas' ending is presented as a series of spoken segments that tell you how your action--or inaction--impacted the world around you. So if you don't help the stealth-loving super mutants wean themselves off of stealth addiction, you'll find out exactly what happens just before the credits roll. Though see the bits of the ending flip one way or the other is sort of an anti-climactic experience, it at least tells you more about the state of the world than you'd have if the game ended after seeing its last in-engine moment.<br /><br /> Let's talk about that engine. New Vegas runs on the same basic framework that powered Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and it brings a lot of technical weirdness up from those games. Less than an hour in, I was staring at a guard, pacing back and forth to guard his post... 20 feet off the ground. Enemies clip into the ground with an alarming frequency, often making them impossible to shoot. The game--a retail disc running on a new-model Xbox 360--crashed on me about a dozen times over the 33 hours I spent playing, often taking a significant amount of progress with it. The load times and frame rate seemed to get randomly worse as I continued to play the game, with some simple scene transitions taking 20 seconds or more. The technical hurdles you'll have to make to stay interested in New Vegas are meaner and more frustrating than any Deathclaw or Nightkin you'll face in the game. If you're the type of person who likes to watch for a patch or two before settling into a game, know this now: you probably don't want to play Fallout: New Vegas right away.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1464089-new_vegas_marcus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1464089\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1464089-new_vegas_marcus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1464089\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/3/30036/1464089-new_vegas_marcus.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/3/30036/1464089-new_vegas_marcus.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Marcus runs Jacobstown and won't just attack you on sight. Crazy, right?</figcaption></figure>     But if you can accept a partially broken game, Fallout: New Vegas is well-worth the trip. It also streamlines some of the rougher aspects of Fallout 3. Dealing with companions, for example, can be done via a wheel of options that pop up when you approach that companion and hit A. This way, you can access their inventory or tell them to heal up without having to work through a bunch of dialogue options first. Some of the companions are pretty cool, too, such as a cyber-dog that can knock your enemies down or Veronica, a young Brotherhood of Steel scribe that offers up some terrific quips, should you ever stop to talk to her. The game also has \"true iron sights,\" which lets you get an aiming view similar to that of Call of Duty, but the sights on most of the guns aren't very good, which just made me want to turn all that off and go back to a generic zoom view when aiming. <br /> <br />The iron sights prove once again that Fallout is not, first and foremost, a first-person shooter, and it's as easy as it's ever been to see invisible dice rolls guiding your bullets just as much as any skill you might when holding a gamepad. The game offers weapon mods, such as scopes and silencers, that you can apply, but they're limited to specific weapons. Modern-day Fallout is about scavenging up whatever weapons you can. Unless you want to get married to a weapon and are willing to spend a significant amount of money keeping it in working order, weapon mods are a waste of time. I was too busy picking up new stuff to worry about keeping one or two guns for any real length of time. The game also has a crafting system that lets you cook the animal meat you scavenge, reload bullets, concoct your own stimpacks, and so on. This might come down to how you want to play the game, but I didn't mess around with crafting very often and never ran low on supplies. There are more than enough stimpacks and existing food items out there that you don't need to go and make your own.<br /><br /> Beyond the handful of new features, New Vegas has the Fallout 3 stuff in it. You'll build your character at the beginning using the same type of character creator, and you'll set your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills. You'll earn perks as you level up and, yes, Bloody Mess is still terrific, as is Mysterious Stranger. There are enough new perks thrown in, however, to keep the game from feeling like it's retreading too much of the same ground. The system works, and it's comforting that this aspect of the game didn't change too much. If you're looking for a more dramatic change, there's a \"hardcore\" mode you can enable, which takes things like dehydration, hunger, and sleep deprivation into account while also making limbs much more difficult to heal while you're out in the wasteland, forcing more trips to a doctor. As its name states, it's pretty hardcore... I certainly don't want anything to do with it, that's for sure.<br /><br /> Visually, Fallout: New Vegas has some amazing moments, though walking out of the doctor's shack and setting eyes on the world for the first time isn't quite as climactic as exiting the vault for the first time was in Fallout 3. The game handles the transition of time really well. Sunsets and sunrises look outstanding, and the glow you'll see coming from the New Vegas strip from just about anywhere in the world also looks great. Some of this is offset by the game's often-awkward animation. Characters still scurry from place to place at times, giving the appearance that they have to hit their marks before delivering a line of dialogue, which can make the whole thing seem like a bad school play in spots.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1362315-awesomedeathray_mueller.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1362315\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1362315-awesomedeathray_mueller.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1362315\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/30/1362315-awesomedeathray_mueller.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/30/1362315-awesomedeathray_mueller.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Well that can't be good.</figcaption></figure>     There's a lot of great voice acting in New Vegas, from the Securitron robots that patrol the strip to the ghouls you find hiding out in a rocket testing facility. You'll hear some great music along the way, too, most of which either fits into the swinging Vegas style or more of a 1930s cowboy theme. As in Fallout 3, the radio stations you can tune in with your wrist-mounted <a data-ref-id=\"3055-386\" href=\"/pip-boy/3055-386/\">  Pip-Boy</a> are great at first, but quickly become too repetitive. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98405\" href=\"/wayne-newton/3040-98405/\">  Wayne Newton</a>'s great as \"Mr. Las Vegas\" on the radio, but he repeats himself so frequently that it's hard to keep it running while you play. Also, the playlists are short. I feel like I've heard Peggy Lee sing \"Johnny Guitar\" a thousand times now. With more dialogue and more licensed tracks, the radio option could have been much, much better.<br /><br /> It's not a surprise that Fallout: New Vegas sticks closely to Fallout 3's structure and style. But if it weren't for the game's way-too-long list of technical issues, New Vegas would actually be better than its predecessor. Instead, it's a well-written game with so many issues that some of you might want to take a pass, at least until some of this nonsense gets fixed.

No, seriously--I'm not trying to be all cute here and feign outrage at how hard it is. I <i>hate</i> this game. Sometimes. But I guess I also love it (not easy to admit). It's the times when those two feelings collide in a Venn diagram of pain that you're tapping straight into the bloody beating heart of this brutally hard, ultra-fast-paced throwback of a platformer. It's one of the toughest games I've ever played, but just try to stop yourself from getting swept up in how ridiculous and extreme it all is.<br /><br /> Super Meat Boy is some two or three hundred levels of total run-and-jump mayhem, a member of the \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-1165\" href=\"/masocore/3015-1165/\">masocore</a>\" genre that includes such indie luminaries as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20773\" href=\"/n/3030-20773/\">N+</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22845\" href=\"/i-wanna-be-the-guy/3030-22845/\">I Wanna Be the Guy</a>. If you've suffered through one of those games you know exactly how this game plays as well. If not, it's a platformer where your character is just a few pixels tall (and is in this case an animated hunk of meat), and you have an incredible degree of control over how you move that character around. You can run extremely fast, stop on a dime, reverse direction on your jumps in mid-air, skid up and down walls, and more, and this much control lets you pull off all kinds of insane-looking moves. You'll need those moves, because the levels are... unpleasant.<br /><br /> Those levels only last anywhere from three to, say, 30 seconds. Or at least, they would only take that long if they were played perfectly by a robot. As a fallible human being you're likely to spend anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours trying to work your way through some of the utterly absurd, you-have-to-be-kidding level designs that populate SMB's later worlds. You will want to break a controller, repeatedly, but the feeling of accomplishment after every level is equally intense. And the way the game flows is one of its greatest strengths. You respawn instantly when you die, so there's no punishment for death other than making you try again, and the absolutely fantastic music in each world never stops when you change levels, giving the progression from level to level a great sense of momentum.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38382/1484747-meat_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1484747\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"550\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38382/1484747-meat_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1484747\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/3/38382/1484747-meat_3.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You can't reason with a talking turd. Don't even try!</figcaption></figure>     Super Meat Boy has such a reverence for both modern independent game development and the halcyon era of 8- and 16-bit classics. From the former, the developers called in favors from a bunch of their indie friends and included a huge number of playable characters like<a data-ref-id=\"3005-10834\" href=\"/commander-video/3005-10834/\"> Commander Video</a> (<a data-ref-id=\"3025-1298\" href=\"/bittrip/3025-1298/\">Bit.Trip</a>), <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5730\" href=\"/tim/3005-5730/\">Tim</a> (<a data-ref-id=\"3030-20716\" href=\"/braid/3030-20716/\">Braid</a>), the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-660\" href=\"/alien-hominid/3005-660/\">Alien Hominid</a>, and the kid from I Wanna Be The Guy. There must be close to 20 playable characters in here, and they all have their own special powers that let them do things like stick to walls, float in mid-air, double jump, or rewind time (guess who does that one). I only got a handful of those guys, though, because the requirements to get them are even more ludicrous than the rigors of the main game. But I'll circle back around and unlock them soon.<br /><br /> I totally will! Seriously! Just give me a few more tries.<br /><br /> Anyway, the nostalgia is as thick as the indie cred here, with really specific references to games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14547\" href=\"/mega-man-ii/3030-14547/\">Mega Man II</a>, the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6673\" href=\"/castlevania/3030-6673/\">Castlevania</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1653\" href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3030-1653/\">Ninja Gaiden</a> (the NES one, not the arcade one). That stuff comes out of left field, but you have to appreciate it if you have any fond memories of playing video games in the late '80s. The nostalgic bits are woven into the game's own bizarre, sadistic sense of humor that has <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10939\" href=\"/meat-boy/3005-10939/\">Meat Boy</a> chasing the evil <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15922\" href=\"/dr-fetus/3005-15922/\">Dr. Fetus</a>--a fetus inside a robot suit wearing a <i>tailored</i> suit--to recover his girlfriend <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10940\" href=\"/bandage-girl/3005-10940/\">Bandage Girl</a>.

You've got a hundred-some-odd regular levels, and finishing each of those levels under a par time will unlock a \"dark world\" version of the level that is, somehow, even harder. You can collect bandages to unlock more characters, but most of those might as well be impossible to get. At 20 bandages, you unlock \"Teh Internets,\" a portal through which the game's developer will be pushing out free DLC levels on a regular basis. In fact, they've already posted an entire set of 20 new levels before the game is even out. All this is to say nothing of the numerous, insanely hard warp zones and kill screens hidden all over the game. Every time I thought I had seen everything this game has to offer, it genuinely surprised me with some other crazy new type of level or challenge. On top of all that, the developer has <a data-ref-id=\"1100-2654\" href=\"/hey-guess-what-super-meat-boy-is-10-until-november/1100-2654/\">lowered the first-month asking price to $10</a>, which makes this seem like a pretty ridiculous value.<br /><br /> Super Meat Boy knows exactly what it wants to do, which is to baffle, entertain, and frustrate you, to fill you with joy and rage in equal measure. And by God it does all those things without apology.

No sooner are they  out of the house and knocking on neighbors' doors that one of them (the  one you didn't choose to control at the beginning of the game) is  kidnapped by a horrible, candy burgling goblin. He skitters off toward a  mysterious black gate at the edge of the suburbs, and you're off on a  quest to save your sibling, while ridding the world of candy grubbing beasts in the process.<br /><br />  That quest comes in the form of a game that feels a little bit like \"My  First RPG.\" In the game's overworld, you'll find yourself wandering  around three distinct areas (the suburbs, a local mall, and a carnival  village on the outskirts of town). These worlds are chock full of hidden  stuff to find, not to mention a couple of additional children who are  more than willing to tag along on your quest. Eventually you'll find  yourself going door-to-door and trick-or-treating. Behind each door lies  one of two things: A costumed adult, who usually has some pithy comment  for you before they unload gobs and gobs of candy (the game's currency)  on you, or a horrible monster of some fashion, who usually says  something equally pithy before engaging you in battle. <br /><br />  Battles play out in turn-based fashion, and once a fight is engaged,  your characters morph from cute little kids into giant, battle-ready  versions of whatever costume they happen to be wearing. Costumes are  earned throughout the course of the game (either by finding the  materials in chests, or by completing side quests for other characters),  and each one comes with its own unique set of combat abilities. There  are attack-oriented costumes--like the robot costume that turns you into  a giant <a data-ref-id=\"3025-290\" href=\"/gundam/3025-290/\">  Gundam</a>-looking cybernetic thing with a fist-firing basic attack, and a  special attack that blasts missiles at all enemies currently on the  screen--as well as more defense and stun-oriented costumes--such as the  <a data-ref-id=\"3035-790\" href=\"/the-statue-of-liberty/3035-790/\">   Statue of Liberty</a> costume, which, yes, transforms your character into a  giant-sized Statue of Liberty, capable of blasting fire as a basic attack, and  for a special move heals all party members via a delightfully patriotic  mural that features the American flag, bald eagles, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3731\" href=\"/abraham-lincoln/3005-3731/\">      Abraham  Lincoln's</a> floating head. The less said about the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2030\" href=\"/french-fries/3055-2030/\"> French fry</a> costume,  which morphs you into what would happen if you cross-bred the greasy  snack with an enraged spider, the better.<br /><br />  The combat moves are executed through a variety of different  timing-based button presses. Sometimes it's a well-timed press of one  button, sometimes it's a meter that can only be filled up by pressing  the left control stick over and over, but in every event, it's all  pretty simple stuff. The variety of costumes and related combat moves is  actually pretty good, but it won't take you long to find the costumes  you're most comfortable with, and odds are you'll stick to those  throughout the course of the game. That fact does make the combat a tad  repetitive, as does the fact that few, if any, of the battles are  terribly difficult. I don't think I lost a fight until I got to the last  boss, actually. The addition of battle stamps, purchasable items that  give you added abilities like increased attack strength and additional  stun abilities, add a bit of variety to the proceedings, but not a great  deal.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101590/1542808-missle_barrage.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1542808\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101590/1542808-missle_barrage.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1542808\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/10/101590/1542808-missle_barrage.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>  ...But once imagination gets involved, they turn deadly. </figcaption></figure>      That said, whatever repetitiveness the game might suffer from is pretty  well trumped by its positive onslaught of charm and humor. This being a  Double Fine game, Costume Quest's dialogue is unsurprisingly quite  clever and humorous, but more to the point, the world of this game is  simply adorable as all get-out. There is a distinctly cartoonish, almost  cel-shaded look to the game, not to mention a smoothness and stylish  quality to the animation that makes this one a real eye-pleaser. The  delightfully Halloween-y music certainly adds to the atmosphere, as  well.<br /><br />  Additionally, while the game's quest isn't a terribly long one, the basic pace and design of the game feels just about <i>right. </i>Each  world is just big enough to make exploring it a fun endeavor, while not  being so large as to be unwieldy or confusing. The game never gets  fetch-questy to pad its length, sticking to quests that you'll solve  naturally over the course of your exploration. And while the mechanics  of the game are undoubtedly simple, the combat never gets old. Even if  you do end up sticking to a few specific costumes and attacks through  most of the game, you'll undoubtedly want to see them all, and try out  each of their different moves a few times, since the battle animations  are often pretty entertaining. <br /><br />  Perhaps Costume Quest could have benefited from one additional world to  explore, a little bit more in the way of costume and combat variety, or a  slight uptick in challenge, but ultimately, these few issues do  little to hinder one's enjoyment of what is an incredibly bewitching  little title. What Double Fine has done right here easily trumps what  few issues it might have. This is an easy game to lose yourself in for  as long as it lasts, and, by the end of the adventure, all I could think  to myself was how much I'd like to see these characters again come next  All Hallows' Eve.", "deck": "This lightweight RPG oozes charm and humor.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-328/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store, PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32304/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/costume-quest/3030-32304/", "id": 32304, "name": "Costume Quest"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-10-20 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-104750/", "id": 104750, "name": "Costume Quest"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/ea-sports-mma-review/1900-329/", "description": "<br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1523173-ea_sports_mma_ng_scrn_tatsuya002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1523173\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1523173-ea_sports_mma_ng_scrn_tatsuya002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1523173\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/11660/1523173-ea_sports_mma_ng_scrn_tatsuya002.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dude-on-dude violence. </figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26815\" href=\"/ea-sports-mma/3030-26815/\">EA Sports MMA</a> makes a terrible first impression, especially if you've been playing <a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\">THQ</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29376\" href=\"/ufc-undisputed-2010/3030-29376/\">UFC Undisputed</a> series. MMA has a control scheme that, at first, seems too simple. It's also a timing-based game that discourages button mashing in favor of more careful play... but it doesn't do a very good job of teaching you how to time your moves. This leads to a few hours of frustration and confusion, but once you get over the hump, EA Sports MMA has some real depth to it, and the fighting feels more like the real thing than the games that have come before it. It also has some interesting online options that, if there are enough people playing on a regular basis, could make for some very cool tournaments. <br /> <br />The fighting system is deceptively simple, employing a universal control scheme that behaves similarly whether you're standing up, on the ground, on top of a guy, or in the standing clinch. It's based around using specific buttons to either improve or get out of your current position. When your opponent tries to posture up, it's on you to deny that with another button press. Submissions are also done via one button, though this quickly engages one of two different minigames, depending on whether it's a limb-based submission or a choke. Strikes are handled with the right analog stick, as in EA's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-190\" href=\"/fight-night/3025-190/\">Fight Night</a> series, with triggers used as modifiers for body punches or kicks.  <br />  <br /> EA Sports MMA doesn't necessarily have the fighters that you'd want to see in an MMA game. Because many of those fighters appear in UFC. Instead, EA has gone out and licensed a bunch of individual fighters, as well as Strikeforce, a competing organization. If the first thing you want out of an MMA game is the biggest names in the sport, you might be a little underwhelmed. But EA's game is not without its stars, including guys like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-14375\" href=\"/randy-couture/3005-14375/\">Randy Couture</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6094\" href=\"/fedor-emelianenko/3005-6094/\">Fedor Emelianenko</a>, and fighting stalwarts like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-573\" href=\"/ken-shamrock/3005-573/\">Ken Shamrock</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-14135\" href=\"/bob-sapp/3005-14135/\">Bob Sapp</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11390\" href=\"/bas-rutten/3005-11390/\">Bas Rutten</a>, who also serves as your head trainer in the game's career mode. Personally, I found the most satisfaction by using the game's fighter creation options, which uses the same \"Game Face\" option found in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20452\" href=\"/fight-night-round-4/3030-20452/\">Fight Night Round 4</a>, allowing you to use two photos of yourself (or anyone else who happens to stumble in front of your camera) to generate your face. There's also a fighter share option that lets you download other created fighters, provided you enter the code that is packed-in with all new copies of the game. Predictably, the top downloads are currently filled with created versions of real-life UFC fighters like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8576\" href=\"/brock-lesnar/3005-8576/\">Brock Lesnar</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1539\" href=\"/chuck-liddell/3005-1539/\">Chuck Liddell</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3914\" href=\"/wanderlei-silva/3005-3914/\">Wanderlei Silva</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9097\" href=\"/frank-mir/3005-9097/\">Frank Mir</a>, and so on.<br /><br /> Those created fighters also figure into the game's career mode, where you'll build up their stats via a series of training exercises. Unlike some other boxing or MMA career modes, this one lets you simulate the game's training minigames with no penalty once you've completed them once. This helps keep the career mode moving as you work your way up through three leagues. You'll also add up to 16 special moves to your fighter via training, letting you tailor your fighter's submission moves or add a Superman punch, spinning backfist, front kicks, and other offensive and defensive maneuvers. The career mode is pretty straightforward, but it at least gives you some sort of progression if you're going to play by yourself. Also, the training minigames are the game's real tutorial, teaching you combos and the basics of getting your submissions cinched in. There's an \"MMA 101\" option available on the main menu that attempts to be a tutorial, but it's lame. It's too bad the game isn't better about revealing itself to new players, as the learning curve is, in some spots, needlessly high.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1443461-ea_sports_mma_ng_scrn_xtc_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1443461\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1443461-ea_sports_mma_ng_scrn_xtc_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1443461\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/19513/1443461-ea_sports_mma_ng_scrn_xtc_001.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The career mode is pretty linear, giving you choices on your training and special moves, but not much else.</figcaption></figure>     Of course, all of this builds up to taking on real, live opposition. Naturally, you can do this alongside your opponent locally, but the online mode is where the real action is. You'll rank up as you fight and earn the ability to challenge other players for online titles, and if you're just looking to fight your friends, you can set up unranked fight cards that let you assign a human player to each slot. It helps that EA Sports MMA is actually fun to watch, and that once players get good, it starts to more closely resemble actual real-world fights. This also factors into an online live broadcast mode, where selected players get a chance to compete online during a live event, complete with live human commentary from EA. Considering the commentary in the regular game is a little flat and repetitive, hearing actual people talk about the fights and getting to see players' pre-recorded \"hype\" videos is a pretty cool twist on what would otherwise be a pretty standard mode. Of course, only a handful of players will get selected for the live events, so most of us will probably be relegated to just watching the action. Either way, it's a really neat idea.<br /><br /> EA Sports MMA has great animation. The models don't clip through each other very often, and the movements look believable, like the fighters are constantly struggling for position. This actually makes the game a little harder to pick up, as it's initially tough to tell when your button presses are translating into on-screen action. The controller vibrates when the other fighter is attempting to make a move on you when you're grounded, but you'll have to spend time watching the action to figure out which animations are which when you're trying to move past the guard and into a mounted position. There's a decent amount of ring variety in the game, too, allowing you to fight in octagonal rings, circular arenas, and traditional boxing rings.<br /><br /> If you're willing to put in the time to learn how to actually play it properly, EA Sports MMA becomes a very rewarding experience. When you lose a fight online, you usually know exactly what you need to work on, either in the career mode to get your fighter's stats up or just, you know, as an actual player.

It's a cynical and condescending way to do business, and it's rampant enough that it has left an indelible mark on the Wii platform as a whole. Leave it to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> to prove that there's nothing wrong with a party game with the bluntly yet accurately titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31210\" href=\"/wii-party/3030-31210/\" slug=\"wii-party\">Wii Party</a>. The house-brand name actually helps to underline the fact that you don't need some half-assed <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5494\" href=\"/carnival-games/3030-5494/\" slug=\"carnival-games\">carnival</a> theme or a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-508\" href=\"/mario-party/3025-508/\" slug=\"mario-party\">shoehorned mascot</a> to make a party game work. The only gimmick here is a plainly presented collection of fun, clever minigames. Doesn't seem so hard, does it? <br/> <br/> Other than the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-270\" href=\"/mii-support/3015-270/\" slug=\"mii-support\">Miis</a> that populate the game, the only character to speak of in Wii Party is a muppety, pink-tuxedoed ringmaster whose primary purpose is to get you up to speed on certain mechanics and to point you to the minigames you'll have the most fun with. Wii Party assumes that you're here to <i>party</i>, so the very first time--and <i>every</i> time--you boot the game up, you're immediately presented with a simple menu giving you a few different ways to approach the 70-plus minigames contained within. <br/> <br/> Top row, you've got five different board games to choose from, each of which helpfully lists the average runtime of a full game, ranging from 15 minutes to about an hour. Longtime <a data-ref-id=\"3025-508\" href=\"/mario-party/3025-508/\" slug=\"mario-party\">Mario Party</a> players should be familiar with the infuriating odds-evening that can happen within this format, to the point that your performance in the actual minigames can be inconsequential. Wii Party has a few built-in mechanisms for introducing some random chance and keeping games from being complete washouts, but it does so with a certain restraint. It also doesn't hurt that the board game mechanics themselves are appreciably different from one to the next, going from a dice-powered trip up a perilous mountain to a Mii-themed game of bingo.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1365691-wii_party_wii_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1365691\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56264775413712\" data-width=\"423\" style=\"width: 423px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1365691-wii_party_wii_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1365691\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/45471/1365691-wii_party_wii_001.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The main menu is totally self-explanatory... when it's in English.</figcaption></figure>     There's also a suite of cooperative two-player games, the most interesting of which test how much you know, or <i>think</i> you know, about your partner. Similarly, the best of the House Party selections tend to be more about facilitating parlor games that involve quiz shows about your fellow contestants, hot-potato word games that have you tossing <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1304\" href=\"/wii-remote/3055-1304/\" slug=\"wii-remote\">Wii Remotes</a> back and forth, and a straight-up, Wii-Remote-based game of hide-and-seek. The level of quality and variety in the minigames is admirable across the board in Wii Party, but these House Party games felt particularly clever, and I wish there were more of them. In most cases, Wii Party will pinch-hit with AI players if you can't wrangle up two to four players, though these House Party types require live competitors to work. Then again, if you're playing a party game all by yourself, you probably need to reassess some things about your lifestyle.<br/><br/> With a few exceptions, you can access just about everything Wii Party has to offer right from the get-go. If you don't need the board-game framing devices, you can go straight to a list of minigames, or if you'd rather not poke around the list, you can hit the \"suggestions\" button on the main menu, dial in the number of players and the amount of time you've got, and go from there. <br/><br/> I think it speaks volumes to just how low the level of quality in most Wii party games has become that all it took was Nintendo putting together a competent, though still largely familiar package, to put everyone else to shame.

That willingness to buck the oh-so-serious tropes of the genre is what made the first two Fable games so endearing, and the new third game in the series has that same absurd charm running all through it. Absurdity may have also governed some of the design elements that shape the way <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27878\" href=\"/fable-iii/3030-27878/\" slug=\"fable-iii\"> Fable III</a> plays and progresses, though. Too frequently it feels like the game mechanics do their best to obscure, rather than enhance, what Fable does best. <br/> <br/>This sequel has a loose connection to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20514\" href=\"/fable-ii/3030-20514/\" slug=\"fable-ii\"> Fable II</a>, with you in the male or female role as the younger offspring of the heroic monarch you played in the last game. It seems your older brother and the current king Logan is a bit of a despotic jerk who's ruling <a data-ref-id=\"3035-52\" href=\"/albion/3035-52/\" slug=\"albion\"> Albion</a> with an iron fist. The people are eager for a hero to lead a rebellion against him, and naturally it only takes one injustice at the hands of your brother before you are that hero, on the lam and gathering followers to take the crown for yourself and (if you choose) rule with benevolence. Lionhead did a good job of evolving Albion's look and feel, giving you the sense that a few decades have passed in which the rapid rise of industry has sullied the land and stratified the population into a mass of working poor and the wealthy elites who exploit them. The opening cinematic's tour around the belching smokestacks and through the polluted back alleys of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1702\" href=\"/bowerstone/3035-1702/\" slug=\"bowerstone\"> Bowerstone</a> is enough to convince you that Albion is a kingdom that could <i>use</i> some saving. It's a good way to kick off your quest and give you a reason to see it through. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1403662-996895_20100614_screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403662\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1403662-996895_20100614_screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403662\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1403662-996895_20100614_screen002.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The people of Bowerstone have seen better days.</figcaption></figure>     The drive to bring the kingdom's varying cultures to your cause provides a good impetus to move you from area to area, and most of the story quests focus squarely on that goal. Everything about the way Fable plays at its core is still sound here. It's still got that basic but satisfying three-part, one-button combat, with melee, ranged, and magic each on its own button. And on the margins, Fable III also has plenty of loose, optional side questing that lets you build up your character through new weapons, clothing, relationships with other citizens, and chances to tweak your moral alignment toward good or evil. If you want to take a break from your revolution to participate in a tabletop roleplaying game gone absurdly awry, or father a bunch illegitimate children, or bet on chicken races, or become a wealthy business magnate, or hunt down dozens of awfully foul-mouthed garden gnomes, you can do those things and a lot of delightfully silly other things too.<br/> <br/> The side quests are your chance to witness lots of ridiculous and often riotous little storylines playing out here and there. Fable doesn't get enough credit for being funny, or at least, it's not a franchise that's thought of first as a vehicle for comedy. But this game is downright hilarious, and it's at least clever and expertly written when it's not outwardly trying to make you laugh. And the game's wry British sense of humor is brilliantly enhanced by the celebrity voice cast, most of whom I didn't even know about till I watched the credits. At the time I just remember thinking, repeatedly, that the writing and voice acting sure were fantastic, maybe some of the best in the business.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1464674-combat_and_leveling_up__5_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1464674\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1464674-combat_and_leveling_up__5_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1464674\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1464674-combat_and_leveling_up__5_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1464674-combat_and_leveling_up__5_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Some of the new interface elements work out better than others.</figcaption></figure>     Those are the good parts of Fable, which are again in effect in Fable III. But it's in navigating all those quests and trying to keep up with all the items you're picking up and people you're meeting and real estate you're buying and weapons you're upgrading and... well, it's a lot to take in, and Fable III doesn't give you a good, clear pathway to accessing and managing those things. The last game certainly had its issues with menu presentation and so on, but Lionhead's solution here wasn't to improve those menus to but rather toss them out completely. Now, in order to change your clothing or weapons, or look at the map, or check your quest log--to do anything managerial at all, really--your character has to bodily teleport to a small hub level and then physically run up to the wall in your armory to change your weapons out, or over to the map table to view the world map. It's nice to get a visual representation of things like new clothing before you use them, but this intermediate step between exploring the world and accessing important information starts to make the game feel ponderous after a while.<br/> <br/> Streamlining and simplifying the user interface is a noble goal, but I really feel like Lionhead threw the baby out with the bathwater here. In-game, you no longer see helpful things like a life bar, so you never know exactly how close to death you are, nor how many health potions you have remaining (unless you're in battle), so you don't know when you need to go buy more. But you do see an enormous reminder containing your current quest's name and description that takes up at least the top fifth of the screen. That thing <i>never</i> seems to go away when you want it to. And while the game will occasionally pop up D-pad shortcuts to things like the map, they only appear when some sort of internal logic deems them necessary. Why shouldn't up on the D-pad <i>always</i> take you to the map, instead of only when the game thinks you might <i>want</i> to see the map? It's an unfriendly and downright baffling way to handle the interface, which should just quickly lead you to basic, important game functions instead of only dangling them in front of you from time to time.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1403666-996895_20100614_screen006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403666\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1403666-996895_20100614_screen006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403666\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1403666-996895_20100614_screen006.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1403666-996895_20100614_screen006.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The look and feel of the world is Fable, through and through.</figcaption></figure>     The game has some other rough spots of a mostly technical nature. I had quests randomly disappear from my quest log on occasion, and the light-up breadcrumb trail that guides you to the quest locations in the game world would always disappear along with them. Since Fable III's in-game map still isn't the most functional, any gap in your navigational tools really sticks out. I also hit one nearly game-breaking issue deep into the game where an enemy fell through the floor and the game wouldn't progress the storyline until I killed that enemy. Reloading the game took me right back to that exact same state, which made me think I was going to have to start the game over at the beginning and throw out almost 20 hours of progress. I eventually figured out a way to find the enemy's location by the sounds it was making, and used area-of-effect magic to kill it, but for about 10 minutes there I sort of felt like I was going to be sick.<br/> <br/> I was willing to forgive all those interface issues as long as I was enjoying the adventure on offer in Fable III, which I really was for most of the game. But there's a significant shift in the storyline and, consequently, the game mechanics in the last few hours of the game, once your revolution succeeds and you take the throne, that alters the tone and the pacing of what you're doing. You're still getting to hack up <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3283\" href=\"/hobbes/3015-3283/\" slug=\"hobbes\"> hobbes</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2412\" href=\"/hollow-man/3015-2412/\" slug=\"hollow-man\"> hollow men</a>, and completing quests in exotic lands, but there's an extra layer of responsibility on top of that which feels like it introduces more urgency into the Fable experience than I'm comfortable with. And when I finally felt like I had a handle on the new stuff that was going on, I got dragged without warning past the point of no return, into a lackluster endgame scenario before I'd had time to finish up all the business I knew I wanted to take care of. Not finishing those few tasks significantly affected the way my ending turned out, and left my version of Albion in such a state that, despite having a stack of side quests and achievements to finish up, I kind of don't ever want to visit it again. I know this sounds like the world's vaguest complaint (getting more specific would require me to detail most of the story's major plot points), but the way the game wrapped up in the last few hours really lessened my experience with the package as a whole. <br/> <br/>Fable III does a great job reprising the elements you expect from the Fable series. The colorful, sprawling lands to explore, the great flexibility in how you develop your character and make your way through the world, the wonderfully dry sense of humor, and the cockeyed view of fantasy tradition are all here and accounted for. It's just the rough trimming around the edges, the ways that those grand elements could have been better realized and better conveyed to the player, that make this as frustrating a game as it is lovable.    ", "deck": "Fable's cheeky charms get a bit buried by strange design decisions in this new sequel from Lionhead.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-331/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27878/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fable-iii/3030-27878/", "id": 27878, "name": "Fable III"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-10-25 21:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-85940/", "id": 85940, "name": "Fable III"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dj-hero-2-review/1900-332/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1396549-29mkev7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396549\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1396549-29mkev7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396549\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1396549-29mkev7.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Star battles have two DJs competing simultaneously.</figcaption></figure>     The original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23882\" href=\"/dj-hero/3030-23882/\" slug=\"dj-hero\">DJ Hero</a> was a bright spot in a year that looked sort of grim for the music genre. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a> was flooding the market with \"<a data-ref-id=\"3025-1308\" href=\"/activision-hero/3025-1308/\" slug=\"activision-hero\">Hero</a>\" games and the whole thing was starting to look like it was about to collapse under its own weight. But the developers at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4343\" href=\"/freestylegames-ltd/3010-4343/\" slug=\"freestylegames-ltd\">FreeStyleGames</a> are producing the only game with Hero in the title worth caring about in 2010, and they've made a handful of smart additions that make <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29778\" href=\"/dj-hero-2/3030-29778/\" slug=\"dj-hero-2\">DJ Hero 2</a> feel like a better, more complete game.<br/> <br/> DJ Hero 2 works off of the same basic concept as the previous game, offering mashed-together songs and giving you a turntable controller that you'll use to cut back and forth between the two records and, when asked, scratch. The sequel uses the same controllers as the original, but it still manages to add new types of freestyle sections, giving you a little more control over how some parts of the track sound. Freestyle crossfading sections are probably the most dramatic, since you can cut off either record or let both play. This is the most direct and realistic freestyle section available. You can also scratch on your own in freestyle scratch sections, but these don't feel as accurate. The game sort of lays out a basic scratch track, and you're sort of rubbing that back and forth. There are also held notes, where you have to hold one of the three buttons down for a set length of time. That's a minor thing on its own, obviously, but when all of these new elements combine, they make DJ Hero 2 feel more dynamic than its predecessor. There's more to do and the action feels like it's more closely simulating things you might actually do on a real turntable.<br/> <br/> You'll deploy your mock-turntablism across 80 or so different mixes, some of which are broken out into the game's battle mode, which is where two players can compete either locally or online. The battle mode is part of an expanded multiplayer component, which offers different competitive game modes beyond the simple star battle. Some of these are more streak-focused, where you'll have to bank your longest note streak before you lose it. Another employs use of the game's power decks, which are unlocked in the single-player mode.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7580/1538203-dj_hero_2___the_rza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1538203\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7580/1538203-dj_hero_2___the_rza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1538203\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7580/1538203-dj_hero_2___the_rza.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Deploying 'Euphoria' properly can give you a quick boost in points.</figcaption></figure>     The single-player in DJ Hero 2 is very straightforward. It's called \"empire mode,\" but it's not much more than a list of tracks and battles that must be completed to earn stars and unlock additional events, clothing, DJs, arenas, and so on. It's here where you'll encounter the game's licensed, real-life DJs, like Tiesto, David Guetta, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-980\" href=\"/the-rza/3005-980/\" slug=\"the-rza\">The RZA</a>. The most important thing you'll unlock are additional mixes and the aforementioned power decks, which increase your scoring potential. The game makes good use of online leaderboards and provides a feed of what your friends are doing, giving you plenty of opportunities to battle over the lead on a specific song. The power decks can give you the edge in that battle, but the leaderboards denote their use, letting you know who's getting a bit of a lift and who's doing it without any sort of performance enhancement.<br/> <br/> There's an expanded vocal component in DJ Hero 2 that scores a vocalist on how well they sing the songs, making this a three-player game. It's a noble concept, but singing remixes just makes the whole thing sound lame. It takes away from the mixes to have someone--even a great singer--repeating the same line or words again and again, as if their voice is also being chopped up by the turntable controllers. It's an ill-conceived effort that feels completely out of place alongside the rest of the game.<br/> <br/> As with any music game, some portion of your enjoyment of DJ Hero 2 is going to come specifically from your musical tastes and how well they match up with the game's track list. DJ Hero 2 does a better job at picking good, modern content and, when necessary, mashing it up with notable older songs that fit the general mood of the game. There's nothing as out-of-place as Marvin Gaye's \"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\" in DJ Hero 2, and more of the tracks sound like quality mixes that you'd actually consider listening to outside of the game this time around. And, well, any rhythm game that dares to include Snow's \"Informer\" is OK in my book.<br/> <br/> Overall, DJ Hero 2 just feels tight. Everything from the menus to the gameplay has a clean, streamlined look and feel to it. The gameplay additions--with the exception of the weak vocals--are intelligent and really make the game more playable than it was last year.

As someone who's been enjoying rhythm games since they were little more than an exotic novelty for importers of Japanese video game delights, it's been an interesting journey these past 10 years watching the genre evolve into a full-blown cultural phenomenon, doing its share to put video games into the hands of people who would otherwise have no interest in the pastime. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-648\" href=\"/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/\" slug=\"harmonix-music-systems-inc\">                   Harmonix </a>was one of the first--if not the  <i>very</i> first--Western developer to take on the genre with its spacey, techno-driven <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5825\" href=\"/frequency/3030-5825/\" slug=\"frequency\">                  Frequency </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1420\" href=\"/amplitude/3030-1420/\" slug=\"amplitude\">                 Amplitude </a>titles, both of which I was a passionate fan of. But even when I bullied my way into a cramped <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3168\" href=\"/e3/3015-3168/\" slug=\"e3\">                E3</a> backroom for an early look at the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6311\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3030-6311/\" slug=\"guitar-hero\">               Guitar Hero</a> game, as giddy as I was to see someone bring some proper rock-'n-roll sensibilities to what I recognized as an extension of what <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2065\" href=\"/konami-computer-entertainment-japan-inc/3010-2065/\" slug=\"konami-computer-entertainment-japan-inc\">              Konami </a>had started with the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-288\" href=\"/guitarfreaks/3025-288/\" slug=\"guitarfreaks\">             GuitarFreaks</a> series in Japan, I never imagined anyone without an already-established interest in this niche would see the appeal of picking up one of these bright-buttoned plastic guitars.<br/><br/>And yet here we are. Still, I think it's fair to say that the fierce competition between <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">            Activision </a>and Harmonix these past four years has been good for the evolution of the genre, but has also left some folks feeling a certain sense of rhythmic fatigue. Today, even as an ardent fan of the genre, I have significant doubts about its continued longevity, never mind its role as a savior of the struggling music industry. I give this lengthy preamble here, not just for my personal nostalgia's sake, but  to let you know what was swirling through my head as I first put <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27919\" href=\"/rock-band-3/3030-27919/\" slug=\"rock-band-3\">           Rock Band 3</a>, Harmonix's latest and most heedlessly ambitious title, into my <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">          Xbox 360</a>. This is still an iterative experience in a lot of significant ways, but Harmonix has, if you'll pardon my French, gone completely, utterly balls-out, delivering an experience that keys directly into the ways people  <i>actually</i> play Rock Band, while also making what I have a hard time imagining as anything other than the  <i>final</i> instrumental addition to the hardware lineup, and expanding on the core conceit in ways that address the perennial, and perhaps, misguided critique that rhythm game players should just pick up some  <i>real</i> musical instruments, for God’s sake. Frankly, the only real slight I have against Rock Band 3, and part of the reason for this brief history of rhythm games, is that I come away feeling like I’ve experienced the end game for the genre, as I'm having an exceptionally hard time figuring out where it can all go from here.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398798-rb3screenwlogo17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398798\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56290322580645\" data-width=\"1240\" style=\"width: 1240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398798-rb3screenwlogo17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398798\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398798-rb3screenwlogo17.jpg\"></a><figcaption> If this looks too familiar, look a little closer.</figcaption></figure>     For now, let's just talk about where it's at. Rock Band 3 finds all of the basics from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20714\" href=\"/rock-band-2/3030-20714/\" slug=\"rock-band-2\">         Rock Band 2</a> in place, with a career mode that lets you form a virtual band and take them on the road as they go from playing local bars to trotting the globe in private jets to play sold-out arenas. It might seem like a minor point, but the knowing way that Rock Band has approached the weird, wearying trials of the touring rock band, and the tone that 3 maintains, has always been a key part of the Rock Band experience for me. Playing Rock Band is all about emulating the sense of musical performance, and the tone enhances that. You can also just play any of the songs in your Rock Band library--which, if you choose to pay the $5-$10 import fees for past Rock Band games, can include songs from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9860\" href=\"/rock-band/3030-9860/\" slug=\"rock-band\">        Rock Band</a>, Rock Band 2, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25765\" href=\"/lego-rock-band/3030-25765/\" slug=\"lego-rock-band\">       LEGO Rock Band</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29439\" href=\"/green-day-rock-band/3030-29439/\" slug=\"green-day-rock-band\">      Green Day: Rock Band</a>, plus any DLC you've picked up along the way--in a quick play format, as well as build custom playlists. You can also take it online.<br/><br/>None of this is new, but what's significant is how it's all structured, as there's no longer any real distinction between progress your band makes in the tour mode or in random play. It all goes in the same bucket, which, in a way, kind of strips much of the gameiness out of the package, or at least keeps it from distorting the way you'd prefer to approach the game. There's a series of road challenges for the tour experience, with each challenge mapping to a specific regional, national, or international tour for your band. Part of what I really appreciate about the road challenges is that, while each stop comes with a predefined setlist, you're also always presented with alternate options such as playing random or custom setlists from specific eras, genres, or combinations thereof. Not once did I feel like I was facing a bunch of songs that I had no interest in playing, which is a huge step for such a mode.<br/><br/>At first blush, the lack of stuff like explicit, instrument-specific careers made Rock Band 3 seem a little spare to me. But all that stuff is still there, it's just organized into a generalized set of goals that encourages much more à la carte consumption. There are goals for band achievements and specific instrument achievements, goals based on performance in specific sets of songs. There are even sets of goals specific to downloadable songs, and the songs you can import from past Rock Band games. It provides all the sorts of objectives you'd expect and then some, so if you want those sorts of directives to help shape where you spend your time with Rock Band 3, they're there. They just don't get in the way when you just wanna get some friends together and rock out. <br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398789-rb3screen113_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211120.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398789\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56290322580645\" data-width=\"1240\" style=\"width: 1240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398789-rb3screen113_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211120.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398789\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398789-rb3screen113_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211120.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398789-rb3screen113_embargoed_until_june_11_1276211120.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Don't wanna play drums? Don't have to!</figcaption></figure>     Speaking of which, if you've ever played Rock Band with a group, you're familiar with the dilemma of running into songs that no one wants to play on a specific instrument, and Rock Band 3 makes it much simpler for players to just drop in and drop out or adjust the difficulty level they're playing at. This system also makes it much, much easier for the solo player to hop from one instrument to another, without having to do lots of arduous profile swapping. Granted, some of this stuff was introduced in Guitar Hero a few iterations ago, but they're notable additions here regardless.<br/><br/>Completing your goals, in turn, increases your fanbase, unlocking bigger and better road challenges, as well as awarding you with new instruments and wardrobe to deck out your band in, eliminating the cash economy of Rock Band 2. Character creation runs just as deep here as it did in Rock Band 2, and while there's a significant amount of shared wardrobe and hairstyles, the underlying look of the characters has been altered. For lack of a better word, they look a little  <i>harder</i>--still caricatured, but not quite as cartoony, and the overall look of the game just generally has more grit to it. Navigating the wardrobe for these ruffians and ne'erdowells has been streamlined, and while it's all still sorted into a series of different styles, it's easier to just page through, say, all of the shirts you might have available.<br/><br/>For the hardware, there are three, significant new pieces to consider. Most accessibly, and perhaps because of this, most importantly, is the keytar controller. This new controller features an abbreviated set of ebonies and ivories, a small touch-ribbon for some mild effects-bending, and a button for activating overdrive. It can be held  <i>like</i> a keytar, from a standing position with the strap slung over your shoulder, though when first getting to know the instrument, I found it much easier to play from a seated position. Though there are two octaves worth of keys on the controller, for regular Rock Band play, you need only worry about five specific ivory keys near the middle. (We'll get into the pro mode business in a minute.) Aside from the fact that you're using your right hand instead of your left to follow the notes, this five-note configuration makes it very analogous to guitar notation in Rock Band, to the point that, should you find a song that has no specific keyboard charting, you can simply choose a guitar or bass part to play instead. Though you're not strumming anything with your off hand, there's a weight to the keys that makes it a little more physically demanding on your fingers. The fact that there are keys surrounding the five you're trying to hit, rather than the five isolated buttons found on the neck of a guitar controller, can make it harder to move the position of your hand and play by feel. Still, I regularly found myself choosing to play guitar and bass parts with the keytar controller, even when I had a capable guitar controller sitting right next to me, simply because there's something about the keys that makes it feel  <i>more</i> like a musical instrument.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398793-rb3screenwlogo12_1276211126.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398793\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56290322580645\" data-width=\"1240\" style=\"width: 1240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/1398793-rb3screenwlogo12_1276211126.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398793\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398793-rb3screenwlogo12_1276211126.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56735/1398793-rb3screenwlogo12_1276211126.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Finally, those piano lessons are paying off.</figcaption></figure>     The keytar controller also comes with a pro mode option, easily the most ambitious feature in Rock Band 3, as well as one that's aimed squarely at the most hardcore and musically adventurous players out there. While Rock Band has always been about interpolating the act of playing a musical instrument into something that just evokes the  <i>feeling</i> of playing that instrument, pro mode strips away that pretense, putting every last key to use. There are also pro mode options for the drums, which require you to purchase a set of additional cymbals to attach to a standard set of Rock Band drums, as well as a pro mode for guitar. There will be two hardware options for the pro mode guitar, though neither is available at launch. There's a MadCatz-produced controller whose neck features narrow, individual buttons for each fret and string placement, as well as five short strings at the bottom for picking and strumming, in addition to an actual, MIDI-enabled Fender Mustang guitar built to interface with Rock Band 3. The price tag for the pro mode guitars is just as daunting as the actual challenge of playing these songs note-for-note, starting at around $150. <br/><br/>There's the full easy-to-expert gradation in difficulty within the pro mode, as well as a series of patient tutorials that introduce basic musical concepts like scales and chords and so on. As someone who's been playing this style of rhythm game for a long, long time, I'd settled into the difficulty settings I'm comfortable with a while ago, but pro mode reveals a whole new set of challenges to undertake. At its highest end, the difficulty seems insurmountable to me, someone with little in the way of actual musical skill, but it still starts off approachable enough. <br/><br/>The actual on-disc music of Rock Band 3 seems largely informed by the hardware additions, the keytar specifically. Songs like The Doors' \"Break On Through,\" Dire Straits' \"Walk of Life,\" J. Geils Band's \"Centerfold,\" Huey Lewis and the News' \"Power of Love,\" and Elton John's \"Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)\" are just fun songs, but they seem particularly notable because of their prominent keys. Still, it's a varied soundtrack without feeling schizophrenic, and while there are definitely songs geared more towards some instruments than others--INXS's \"Need You Tonight\" is a fine jam, but there's barely enough keyboard parts to justify paying attention--everyone gets their fair due.<br/><br/>So with Rock Band 3, Harmonix has introduced the keyboard, the last of the common rock instruments, as well as a set of instruments that eliminate the distinction between playing a game and playing an actual instrument, wrapping it all up in a package that makes itself almost entirely passive to the way  <i>you</i> want to play Rock Band 3. Like I said at the top, I'm not sure where else there is to go, but I don't really care.

So why wasn't it a great game?

But in truth, for all its incredible bells and whistles, its myriad customization options, this game can't shake the eternal monkey on its back: It's just not very much fun to play. <br/> <br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/1511107-e52de4a400e6a65da4734febbead4b85.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1511107\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56237424547284\" data-width=\"994\" style=\"width: 994px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/1511107-e52de4a400e6a65da4734febbead4b85.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1511107\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/1511107-e52de4a400e6a65da4734febbead4b85.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Random rivalries, run-ins and betrayals frequently occur in the new WWE Universe mode.</figcaption></figure>     I wish I could report that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31640\" href=\"/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2011/3030-31640/\" slug=\"wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2011\">             SmackDown! vs. RAW 2011</a> was the game to  change all this, the game to finally toss that monkey aside and revamp  the gameplay from the ground up. Instead, wrestling fans are in store  for more or less the same type of experience they got last year. All the  real improvements have gone into building out the new modes that  debuted last year, as well as some major changes to core modes like the  career mode. Again, it's the outer shell that has seen the most work,  the surrounding walls made more ornate and elaborate, while the core of  the game, the controls and animations and basic wrestling experience,  remains largely the same. It's like the Wizard of Oz; a huge, elaborate  fantasy built to obfuscate the withering, weak old man at the center of  it all. Yes, we're still talking about a wrestling game here. Just bear  with me.<br/> <br/>Let's start where the most significant changes live, and that it's  in the brand-new WWE Universe mode. You've undoubtedly heard this buzz  term tossed around ad nauseum by WWE announcers as of late, though in  the context of this game, it falls into the realm of a new career mode.  WWE Universe presents you with an infinitely running calendar, with each  month packed with four episodes of RAW, SmackDown! and Superstars, as  well as a PPV event. Each card is dynamically booked by the game, but  you can add custom matches to any card you please, utilizing any created  characters, legends, or whoever else you feel like.<br/> <br/>That doesn't mean it's a quick and easy path to the top. You can't  just book yourself in endless title matches just for funsies. You have  to earn your way to the top by winning matches and establishing  rivalries. These pop up simply by fighting other wrestlers, and the game  keeps track of those rivalries via a news tab that lets you know who  hates you on any given week. That's a tricky thing to keep track of,  since pretty much every wrestler you beat will start to hate you, at  least for a bit. Cutscenes, run-ins, and occasional team-ups rear their  heads too, but all of it feels a bit...random. Not that I'd expect a  script-quality storyline to appear as you play through a mode predicated  on randomized events, but a lot of the matches I found myself in  throughout my first year in the Universe mode felt pretty scattershot  and incoherent. After winning the Royal Rumble and starting a rivalry  with champion <a data-ref-id=\"3005-602\" href=\"/randy-orton/3005-602/\" slug=\"randy-orton\">            Randy Orton</a>, I somehow kept getting booked in non-title  matches on Superstars against <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16489\" href=\"/zack-ryder/3005-16489/\" slug=\"zack-ryder\">           Zack Ryder</a>, even though I'd already beaten  him like a dozen times over the course of the year. The whole mode has a  very grindy feel to it, though thankfully you can just sim any matches  you don't feel like messing with. By all means, this is an intriguing  new way to handle a wrestler's career--I just think it'll be a lot  better once Yuke's has had time to perfect the progression of it.<br/> <br/>If you prefer your storylines more heavily scripted, there's still  the Road to Wrestlemania mode to keep you busy. Five specific storylines  are built into this year's mode, each focusing on one specific  wrestler--or, in one case, one specific opponent, in the story where you  take one of the mid-tier wrestlers or a created guy through a story  involving breaking the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-473\" href=\"/the-undertaker/3005-473/\" slug=\"the-undertaker\">         Undertaker's</a> Wrestlemania streak. Like previous  attempts at this mode, the storylines are...goofy, at best, but they do  offer a far more structured take on a character's rivalries and such,  and you do get heaping helpings of voice work from various WWE  Superstars, even if they do sound like they're flatly reading cake mix  ingredients into a microphone most of the time.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/94102/1468925-svr2011_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468925\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/94102/1468925-svr2011_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468925\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/94102/1468925-svr2011_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The newly implemented physics system can lead to some cool moments when using weapons--and some goofy ones, too.</figcaption></figure>     The interesting wrinkle to the Road to WM mode this year is the addition  of a backstage area. At the beginning of each show, your wrestler will  find himself in the backstage area, with multiple dressing rooms, the  GM's office, an interview area, and the training room to explore. The  reason for all this walking around is twofold. One, certain story  elements will only progress when you talk to other wrestlers or your GM.  Additionally, you'll also find random wrestlers wandering about the  place, and you can engage them in conversation, or choose to fight them.  Fighting them just engages a quick backstage brawl, where you have to  knock your opponent out. Doing this, as well as participating in actual  matches, earns you points you can use to upgrade several stats for your  wrestler.<br/> <br/> That all sounds well and good, except that you pretty much have to do  every single backstage fight in order to get enough points to make those  upgrades meaningful--and those fights are repetitive as <i>hell. </i>While  the idea of adding an exploratory element to the mode isn't an  altogether bad one, nothing that's been added here actually enriches the  experience whatsoever. It feels like length-padding gone horribly  wrong, and hopefully won't exist in this form in next year's game.<br/> <br/> Outside of all of that, there are still plenty of features to play around  with. Online modes return with largely the same functionality as last  year (online exhibition matches, the ability to upload and download  created wrestlers and moves, etc.), though the lag issues that plagued  the previous sequel seem largely defeated now. The one new addition is  the Royal Rumble mode, where up to 12 players can take part in the  30-man over-the-top-rope battle we all know and love. It's a neat  addition, especially since even once you're eliminated, the game smartly  gives you an opportunity to come back and wrestle a second (and  possibly even third) time as the match goes on. The only issue is one  simply inherent to the nature of the match, which is that it's easy to  get ganged up on, and that can get pretty frustrating when specific  players are hellbent on working together. Also, I did run into a decent  amount of trouble getting full 12-player matches to sync up properly.  Once they did though, lag was only rarely an issue.<br/> <br/> All the creation and customization options from last year are back, and  with some added functionality. You can still create your own wrestlers,  fix up their entrances with either some quick-and-dirty options, or get  super granular with absurd levels of detail, create highlight reels for  your favorite guys, and design new and exciting finishing maneuvers out  of different slices of animation. Of course, everyone's favorite new  thing from last year, the story editor, returns once again, and with a  greater roster of scenes, scenarios, and options at your disposal. This  mode is still tons of fun to play with, and uploading your stories  online is a pretty nifty thing. <br/> <br/> The one thing I will say is that it'd be nice to see all these different  customization elements find a greater cohesion within the game's online  play. Uploading stories is nice, but it'd be a lot cooler if you could  factor the storylines into a greater online league system, perhaps a la  some of the stuff EA's been doing with its sports titles. Being able to  create leagues and build cards within them, replete with cutscenes and  rivalries and all that hot stuff, that'd be something else. The pieces  to do it are almost all in place at this point. It's just a matter of  Yuke's putting them all together into a greater online universe. <br/> <br/> Then again, maybe that's just not the direction THQ, the WWE, Yuke's, or  anyone else sees this thing going in.<a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5671687/the-spectacle-of-pro-wrestling-played-with-a-straight-face\" rel=\"nofollow\">    In a recent interview</a>, one of the  producers of this title stated that they are all about presenting your  eight-year-old's perception of what pro-wrestling is, and not breaking  \"kayfabe,\" I.E. the concept of reality within the WWE Universe. That  wouldn't seem to be entirely true, given that the game offers you the  ability to create your own unique storylines, essentially admitting  that all this stuff is scripted out. But then again, when you look at  how steadfastly the developers have stuck to the notion that this is  expressly meant to be a game of competition, not a game of management  and design, then those statements make a fair amount of sense.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/1511086-870dcfcb86388355a89ec900f1159747.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1511086\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2000\" style=\"width: 2000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/1511086-870dcfcb86388355a89ec900f1159747.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1511086\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/1511086-870dcfcb86388355a89ec900f1159747.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/1511086-870dcfcb86388355a89ec900f1159747.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The wrestling can be fun in spots, but by and large just feels tired and clunky at this point.</figcaption></figure>     By that same token, if this is truly meant to be a game of competition,  then it's officially time to take that competition out of the rotting,  rickety basket it's been sitting in for the last several sequels. There  is no nice way to put it: This gameplay engine is <i>tired. </i>Every  year, Yuke's tosses in some new change or wrinkle that changes up the  mechanics a bit. The big new thing this year? The removal of a weak/strong grapple  modifier (now strong grapples simply take place when your opponent is  stunned). Does this change have any real impact on gameplay? Not really.  It's a step sideways, not an improvement or a detriment. And that's  what playing SmackDown! has felt like for years now, an endless series  of steps to the side, in order to avoid the fundamental issue that this  whole engine needs to be overhauled, and badly. <br/> <br/> That said, there are some issues inherent to this year's title in  particular that left me scratching my head. For one thing, the default  difficulty level is insanely easy, to the point where I never lost a  singles match I didn't simulate, and actually ended up winning most  matches in pretty quick and tidy fashion, even when I was playing as  lower-tiered guys like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16485\" href=\"/santino-marella/3005-16485/\" slug=\"santino-marella\">        Santino</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16483\" href=\"/primo/3005-16483/\" slug=\"primo\">       Primo</a>. Granted, that was mostly  against the AI, which is still terrible on any difficulty level besides the highest, meaning if you want a competitive match, it's Legend difficulty, or not at all. Online matches are better for  competition, but if you and your opponent both know what you're doing,  the game's one-button reversal system tends to make a lot of online  matches into endless strings of deadlocked reversals.<i> </i><br/> <br/> The look of the game is also aging rather poorly. Once again, it seems  like all the visual energy is being funneled into wrestler entrances,  because the in-ring stuff looks just clunky as hell. Not even the  addition of the Havok physics engine does much to help, especially since  it seems like those physics have really only been haphazardly stitched  onto the game's existing animation engine. It's pretty goofy watching  the stiff moves and strikes try to blend with weapon and object physics  that are working in realtime, and that can lead to some pretty hilarious  glitches. Nothing game-breaking, though it is a bit world-breaking. I think going with a new physics engine to make the weapon hits and table smashings look more realistic is a great idea, but in this year's game, it's clear that Yuke's hasn't completely figured out how to make it all work together.<br/> <br/> By no means is SmackDown vs. RAW 2011 a terrible game, but then, neither  were any of the last several sequels, all of which pretty much went  down this or a similar path. I enjoy playing around with all the  different creation and storyline-focused options in these titles, but  when I actually find myself presented with the concept of wrestling, my  enjoyment disappears in a cloud of disappointment. There was a time when  this gameplay design worked, and that time was <i>years ago. </i>Undoubtedly  stalwart fans of the WWE and this series in particular will find things  to enjoy here, but at some point the larger issues that plague this  franchise are going to have to get addressed.

He also has the kind of forcefully cocky attitude and lack of respect for authority,  <i>man</i>, that lead him to drop wry one-liners about eBay in the heat of battle, or feel totally comfortable <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1442\" href=\"/smoking/3015-1442/\" slug=\"smoking\"> smoking</a>. In  <i>space</i>. It’s unsurprising that Sam ends up at odds with the gruff, half-mechanized leader of the squad of otherwise characteristic-free space marines that he’s tagging along with.  The little shouting matches between the two play host to some specific and familiar post-9/11 language, and Vanquish briefly flirts with <a data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\" href=\"/hideo-kojima/3040-63395/\" slug=\"hideo-kojima\">            Kojima</a> territory with its adorably naive navel-gazing over the horrors of war. For as sincere and serious as it seems like it’s trying to be about ideals like sacrifice and duty, its glimpses of robot dance parties suggest sillier intentions, and yet I can’t tell if Vanquish is winking when it delivers midnight-movie-worthy lines like “We won’t let New York become the next San Francisco!” I guess it doesn’t really matter, I laughed anyway.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1539237-vanquish_013__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1539237\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"912\" style=\"width: 912px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1539237-vanquish_013__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1539237\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1539237-vanquish_013__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You're not the only one out there with bleeding-edge power armor.</figcaption></figure>     It’s his anachronistic nicotine habit that clearly pegs Sam as a facile <a data-ref-id=\"3005-75\" href=\"/solid-snake/3005-75/\" slug=\"solid-snake\">           Solid Snake</a> pretender, but I’m going to let a lot of that slide, just because his awesome gear makes him so much goddamn fun to play as. Aside from making Sam particularly resilient, the suit enables him to perform a rocket-powered slide-tackle, allowing him to move from one piece of cover to another, or put some space in between him and the laser-filled hordes of Russian automatons, with bracing speed. It’s sort of like the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1872\" href=\"/roadie-running/3015-1872/\" slug=\"roadie-running\">          roadie run</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">         Gears of War</a>, but with a greater degree of turning control and much, much faster. The suit also lets you slow down time to better line up your shots--Russian robot design, it seems, falls prey to a recall-worthy weakness to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-85\" href=\"/headshot/3015-85/\" slug=\"headshot\">        headshots</a>, and the massive mechanized bosses you face on the regular are freckled with conveniently glowing red weak spots. Between these two abilities, plus the usual cover-based opportunities to ever-so-briefly retreat from battle, you’ve got a certain deal of control over the pace of the battle, yet the fundamental movement speed is so blinding that it never moves too slowly. Both of these suit abilities tap into a shared energy bar that, if depleted entirely, can take several seconds to cool down and use again, which, in the hot-and-heavy firefights of Vanquish, can be several seconds too long. Managing your energy levels is something to keep in mind, but on its normal difficulty, the game is forgiving enough that you can have some fast-and-loose fun with these abilities. <br/> <br/>Sam also has what may be one of the best guns in video games, because it is, essentially,  <i>all </i>guns. Any gun that Sam finds, either in strategically placed weapon lockers or out on the battlefield, can be scanned in and then immediately equipped. You can store up to three of these patterns at a time, switching between them, and two flavors of grenades, with the D-pad, but there are well more weapons than that, including basic <a data-ref-id=\"3055-608\" href=\"/machine-gun/3055-608/\" slug=\"machine-gun\">       machine-gun</a>, heavy machine-gun, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">     sniper</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">      shotgun </a>varieties, plus a suite of exotic, high-powered lock-on weapons, making for lots of on-the-fly decisions about what to keep and what to drop. I found that, of the basic gun models, I relied on the heavy machine-gun first and foremost, but ammo for weapons like the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">    rocket launcher</a>, pulse cannon, and laser array tended to be a little more scarce. Being aware of ammo for all the weapons you're carrying pays dividends, as the game features a simple upgrade system that increases the rank of a held weapon whenever you pick up that same weapon again, provided you are already maxed out on ammo. <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1539235-vanquish_011__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1539235\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"912\" style=\"width: 912px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1539235-vanquish_011__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1539235\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1539235-vanquish_011__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1539235-vanquish_011__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Quantity AND quality.</figcaption></figure>     Sam's gun also looks spectacular as it rearranges itself from one weapon configuration to another, though the action tends to be so intense, and the third-person angle is such that you don't get to see that slick little touch too often during battle. That's OK, though, as Vanquish makes looking spectacular a big priority in just about everything it does. The battlefield itself is never terribly large, with a very simple, linear path laid out to take you from one encounter to the next, but you're constantly reminded of the almost unfathomable size of the space station, with arching vistas that make Halo look like a townhouse, and set-piece events like a huge space cruiser crashing dramatically into the ground right beside you. The glowing power source on the back of Sam's sleek, scaled suit helps it look even more high-tech than all of the grey steel that surrounds him on the space station, and the insect-like design that permeates the Russian armaments gives them a great alien quality. And, not to sound like a broken record here, but it all moves awfully fast. In a way, that speed is the biggest issue with Vanquish. Aside from making it an experience that can be too intense to take in for long stretches, the game seems to blow right by at around five hours.<br/><br/>Its weird, half-hearted political gestures aside, Vanquish is the kind of video game that reminds you that  <i>these are video games</i>. Perhaps more than any quality, video games allow for visceral thrills unfettered by the real-world logistics of physics and general plausibility. Sometimes a game just needs to look cool and make you feel like a space-age badass, and Vanquish accomplishes both with vigor.", "deck": "An enthusiasm for accelerated popcorn sci-fi action makes this latest ride from PlatinumGames, however brief, an exhilarating one.

It’s somehow the most fully realized insider look into the games business as we’ve seen in a game, despite being on the iPhone, and being pretty overtly cutesy about the whole thing. It’s a game that seems to have found particular resonance within the game development community, something that, at least to me, would seem tantamount to watching your character in <a data-ref-id=\"3025-282\" href=\"/the-sims/3025-282/\" slug=\"the-sims\">      The Sims</a> play The Sims. I suppose this speaks to the ways in which Game Dev Story crudely, yet somehow accurately depicts the game development process, or perhaps the streamlining irons out the messy creases that can make the real thing so damn hard. Maybe it’s just thinly veiled narcissism. Regardless, the low-impact strategy and the simple charm of “playing developer” kept my attention for much longer than just about anything else I’ve encountered on the iPhone.  <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1619783-1559256_img_0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1619783\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.140625\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1619783-1559256_img_0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1619783\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1619783-1559256_img_0004.jpg\"></a><figcaption> He's heating up! </figcaption></figure> As much as Game Dev Story leaves out of the game development process, it covers an admirable amount of ground, and does a pretty good job of laying out the simple, rhythmic flow of the game. I could go into painstaking detail of all the little mechanics tucked in here, of which there are truly legion, but the basics of the business boil down to hiring a staff, choosing the platform, genre, and theme of your game, choosing which employee you’ll have focus on the initial pitch, the graphics, and the sound, doing some debugging and then pushing it out the door, seeing how the critics and the game-buying public take to the game, maybe spend a little money on advertising, and then rinsing, and repeating. Each and every one of these little factors, plus dozens of other, smaller decisions you have to make, can determine the success of each title. It’s fun to experiment and mix and match weird genres and themes--like, say, a historical golf game--and then seeing how successful the results are, but the game obfuscates so much of the math behind each little step that it can, at times, be tough to really min-max the process.<br/> <br/>        While you manage all the little details, including, but not limited to, the training of your employees; whether you choose to attend the annual games industry convention GAMEDEX and how much you want to spend on a booth; whether you want to take a break between dev cycles to take on a quick, potentially lucrative contract job; all the way down to the <i>freaking seating chart for your employees</i>, you also have to keep the big picture in mind, since running out of capital in the middle of the dev cycle will cause that game to be canceled, and cranking out cheap, quick, low-quality games will prevent you from ever winning any awards, or developing any games good enough to warrant a sequel, never mind getting your company to the point where you have the know-how, and the cash, to develop your own console.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1619784-1559264_img_0015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1619784\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.140625\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1619784-1559264_img_0015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1619784\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1619784-1559264_img_0015.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1619784-1559264_img_0015.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> I hope you like menus and graphs! </figcaption></figure> Though it adheres to a pretty strict arc for each game you develop, the game is constantly introducing new genres and themes to play with, new consoles to consider developing for, and bigger offices to make space for more employees. The action in Game Dev Story ultimately boils down to two simple acts: selecting various menu items, and watching various meters fill up. That’s really it! The only real objective in the whole thing is to just make the best durned games you can muster. The game “stops” at the 20-year marker to tally your accomplishments, but you can still keep playing after that, should your heart desire. Personally, by the time I hit  the big two-oh, I had pretty thoroughly burned out on Game Dev Story. For one, those twenty years represented a lot of hours with the game, though the mobile nature of the iPhone and the ability to play in short bursts makes it hard for me to peg an exact play time. The real issue, though, is that I just ran out of new, interesting ways to expand my company at a certain point, and was kind of grinding out games year-in, year-out. When Game Dev Story works, it’s because of the constant carrot-on-a-stick of incremental expansion, and all the busywork can make it hypnotic. I just reached a point where it ran out of carrots.<br/> <br/>        The boxy, pixel-art-style visuals that more than a little recall <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23072\" href=\"/habbo-hotel/3030-23072/\" slug=\"habbo-hotel\">    Habbo Hotel</a> establish the cutesy tone of Game Dev Story, though it’s also jam-packed with characters, consoles, and competing developers and games with names that wink towards real-world games business and pop culture in general. The constantly looping music in Game Dev Story can get pretty shrill after a while, though there’s an option to mute it that I’m very grateful for, and over time I developed a certain Pavlovian response the rest of the game’s cheery little chimes.<br/> <br/>The menu-based interface is clunky as hell, and the odd letterboxed look of the visuals betrays the fact that Game Dev Story was somewhat hastily ported from another mobile platform.

Unfortunately that game's combat suffered from some control and design issues that kept it from realizing its full potential, but at least it had a clear ambition to offer a great, epic <a data-ref-id=\"3025-551\" href=\"/star-wars/3025-551/\" slug=\"star-wars\">Star Wars</a> experience. The new sequel <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29438\" href=\"/star-wars-the-force-unleashed-ii/3030-29438/\" slug=\"star-wars-the-force-unleashed-ii\">The Force Unleashed II</a> doesn't even feel like it's trying to reach those same heights. It's a short, shallow, linear game with entertaining core mechanics but a paucity of all the other things that a really satisfying and memorable action game ought to have.<br/> <br/> That core combat feels a little more refined and accessible than it was in the first Force Unleashed, but otherwise it really hasn't changed. You can still lift <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2030\" href=\"/stormtrooper/3015-2030/\" slug=\"stormtrooper\">stormtroopers</a> up into the air and fling them around, zap them with <a data-ref-id=\"3015-172\" href=\"/the-force/3015-172/\" slug=\"the-force\">Force</a> lightning, throw your <a data-ref-id=\"3055-70\" href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70/\" slug=\"lightsaber\">lightsabers</a> at them, or hit them with a quick Jedi mind trick to make them jump off a cliff (which is pretty funny). But that's about it. There's not much of an upgrade path for all these powers--you can merely put experience points into making them a bit more powerful--so you'll have seen just about all of the combat abilities, not to mention the small handful of enemy types, a couple of hours into the game. I had fun playing through the game, but man, there's not a lot of substance here.<br/> <br/> The story doesn't feel much meatier. The first Force Unleashed ended with the demise of its protagonist, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1564\" href=\"/starkiller/3005-1564/\" slug=\"starkiller\">Starkiller</a>, but this one starts with a contrivance that has <a data-ref-id=\"3005-308\" href=\"/darth-vader/3005-308/\" slug=\"darth-vader\">Darth Vader</a> creating a perfect clone of Starkiller with all his Jedi powers intact... not to mention all of his memories. So you're basically playing the same guy, rendering the last game's ending largely irrelevant. That could have been an interesting setup if the game explored some kind of contrast between the original Starkiller and this reproduction, but it ignores that element almost completely and instead gives you a thin, boilerplate tale about Starkiller helping the Rebellion attack the Empire and looking for <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1779\" href=\"/juno-eclipse/3005-1779/\" slug=\"juno-eclipse\">Juno Eclipse</a>, his pilot-slash-love interest from the first game, at the same time.

If you're respected driving game developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-716\" href=\"/bizarre-creations/3010-716/\" slug=\"bizarre-creations\">Bizarre Creations</a>, the answer lies somewhere in the neighborhood of \"a whole hell of a lot.\" While the developer's all-new <a data-ref-id=\"3005-238\" href=\"/james-bond/3005-238/\" slug=\"james-bond\">Bond</a> tale is primarily a stiff, basic third-person shooter, the action is peppered with just enough driving sequences to remind you that the developers are really good at making that sort of thing, when they aren't attempting to cram their <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25961\" href=\"/blur/3030-25961/\" slug=\"blur\">Blur</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-430\" href=\"/project-gotham-racing/3025-430/\" slug=\"project-gotham-racing\">Project Gotham Racing</a> experience into a game that doesn't necessarily benefit from that sort of thing. The end result is that Bond's adventure has some nice-looking moments, but feels largely uninspired and dead simple.<br/> <br/> With the Bond movie franchise completely sideways at the moment, there's no new film for the developers to draw from. That hasn't stopped Bizarre or <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a>, which have instead taken <a data-ref-id=\"3040-90200\" href=\"/daniel-craig/3040-90200/\" slug=\"daniel-craig\">Daniel Craig</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98301\" href=\"/judi-dench/3040-98301/\" slug=\"judi-dench\">Judi Dench</a> and slapped them into an all-new story with singer, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98303\" href=\"/joss-stone/3040-98303/\" slug=\"joss-stone\">Joss Stone</a>, who is as close as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32093\" href=\"/james-bond-007-blood-stone/3030-32093/\" slug=\"james-bond-007-blood-stone\">007: Blood Stone</a> gets to a \"Bond girl.\" While you'll get a couple of the characters and actors you'd expect from a Bond experience, a lot of the line delivery is flat, and the story, which has 007 on the hunt for missing research, which leads to potentially weaponized anthrax, which leads to a lot of car chases and occasional explosions... by the end of the game, I had already forgotten why I was even there.<br/><br/> Blood Stone plays like your standard post-<a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears</a> cover-based third-person shooter. You can stick to walls, pop out over them to take shots, or blind fire in the general direction of your enemies. You can also execute enemies with up-close melee attacks, which gives you a focus shot. You can store up to three of these, and they operate a bit like the \"mark and execute\" system from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20464\" href=\"/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/3030-20464/\" slug=\"tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction\">Splinter Cell: Conviction</a>. If you hold down the focus button, you'll automatically aim at an enemy's head, and one shot will take him out. If you have multiple instances stored up, you can chain all three of them together to quickly empty an area of enemies. But the focus system isn't really vital to Blood Stone, because the basic shooting is almost as easy. The game will snap your reticle to your target when you aim, and if you feather the zooming aim button while popping off shots, you'll rarely miss shots, even if the enemies are specks on the far side of a long level and you're firing a silenced pistol. On one hand, it makes sense that a guy like James Bond would be so raw that he can waste guards from such a distance. On the other, it doesn't make for a very challenging game. Blood Stone offers four difficulty settings (one of which is locked until you complete the game once), and you'll need to play one of the higher settings to reduce the amount of auto-aim. But since this also makes Bond less resilient, the net result of setting it to Agent or higher is a slower-paced game that drags on too much.<br/> <br/> Like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-asylum\">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>, Blood Stone has an alternate vision mode that shows you your next waypoint, scannable intel items, and the location and current status of any nearby enemies. Seeing your enemies through walls and knowing if they're alert or not is a key piece of info that makes it worth keeping this vision mode on almost all the time. The catch is that the screen gets a layer of static over it when you're in this mode, which can be a little annoying. Also, the in-game conceit for this ability is Bond's cell phone, so whenever you have it enabled, Bond holds his gun in one hand and lazily gazes at his cell phone in the other. It's like he's checking into Foursquare or staring at his Twitter feed in the middle of a firefight or something. It's hardly game-breaking, but it's definitely goofy.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1440346-31_bloodstone_reveal_bizarre.h264_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1440346\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1440346-31_bloodstone_reveal_bizarre.h264_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1440346\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1440346-31_bloodstone_reveal_bizarre.h264_06.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You encounter this style of car in different regions, but it always has the exact same license plate.</figcaption></figure>     After every couple of areas, the story will call for a car chase. So Bond will hop behind the wheel of some licensed super car and drive along a set track in pursuit of some thug. The whole thing feels really scripted, like you can't actually end the car chase early if you happen to be a great driver. If you fall too far behind, though, the target will get away or, in one case, you'll get shot up by a helicopter that's chasing you. Either way, it's back to the last checkpoint. The driving sequences look great, and there's an awesome sense of speed. But you really feel like you're just making your way up a set track until the game decides that you've driven far enough, at which point it goes into a cutscene that ends the chase.<br/> <br/> Aside from the game's solo story mode, there's also a multiplayer component, where you're broken up into two groups (red and blue) and play team deathmatch, a last-man-standing TDM variant, and an objective option, where one team attempts to take over three control points while the other tries to stop them. All of this is set against the same basic third-person action found in the campaign. The map design is a little drab and, overall, the whole mode feels a bit unnecessary. <br/> <br/> Blood Stone isn't bad, but literally every single thing you can find here has been done better elsewhere. Considering there's no shortage of other third-person shooters out there, it's tough to recommend Bond's newest adventure for anything beyond a rental.    ", "deck": "Bond's newest adventure has a few thrilling moments, but the mix of cover-based shooting and car chases doesn't hold up for the duration of its story.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-338/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32093/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/james-bond-007-blood-stone/3030-32093/", "id": 32093, "name": "James Bond 007: Blood Stone"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-11-03 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-104094/", "id": 104094, "name": "James Bond: Blood Stone"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/goldeneye-007-review/1900-339/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Remaking a beloved classic like the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-43\" href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" slug=\"nintendo-64\">               N64</a> shooter <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3166\" href=\"/goldeneye-007/3030-3166/\" slug=\"goldeneye-007\">                GoldenEye 007</a> just  sounds like a bad idea in principle.

The story of the game has been rewritten and  \"modernized,\" with <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89827\" href=\"/pierce-brosnan/3040-89827/\" slug=\"pierce-brosnan\">             Pierce Brosnan's</a> cheeky and suave version of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-238\" href=\"/james-bond/3005-238/\" slug=\"james-bond\">           James Bond </a>replaced by  <a data-ref-id=\"3040-90200\" href=\"/daniel-craig/3040-90200/\" slug=\"daniel-craig\">            Daniel Craig's</a> more sarcastic and overtly homicidal Bond. The new storyline  pretty much follows the key beats of the original, with characters like  the traitorous <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3316\" href=\"/alec-trevelyan/3005-3316/\" slug=\"alec-trevelyan\">          Alec Trevelyan</a>, the cute-as-a-button programmer Natalya  Seminova, and the murder-by-sex specialist <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4553\" href=\"/xenia-onatopp/3005-4553/\" slug=\"xenia-onatopp\">         Xenia Onatopp</a> all making  appearances, albeit in rejiggered form. In most cases the differences  are pretty minor, though they're all pretty keenly designed to fit into  the Craig brand of Bond universe, meaning everyone's a little more  savage, and a little less quippy. At least the voice acting is largely  decent, if a bit stiff in a few places.<br/> <br/> Granted, the original game was pretty light on story to begin with, so  this really only applies to people who were big fans of the movie. As far as  the progression of the game itself goes, the differences you'll notice  tie more largely into the mechanics and layouts of the game's various  levels. You'll find familiar scenery, such as the massive dam at the  outset of the game, plus the tank chase through Russian streets, but  you'll also find that these aren't just rehashes of levels you've  already played. Everything's bigger, more elaborate, comes with the  requisite visual upgrades (which are quite nice as Wii shooters go), and  lean a bit heavier on the action. Some of that comes from the improved  enemy AI, which is certainly several steps above the dunderheads that  occupied the original--these guys will actually detect you if you're not  careful with your attempts at stealth, call in reinforcements, and use  cover just like you will. <br/> <br/> There are other changes. Bond now has an all-important smart phone,  which he can use to hack various electronic things around each level (such as door locks and controls for sentry guns). Also, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">    quick time events</a>!  You love those, right? Now they're here, albeit in limited and mostly  unobtrusive fashion. You'll also periodically find yourself in a bit of  an on-rails sequence, shooting down bad guys as you roll along on a  motorcycle or sit shotgun in a stolen Russian supply truck. Most of these  additions are pretty light in the grand scheme of things, though, and  the vast bulk of the time you'll be running around, shooting Russians  and Janus Group thugs in their stupid faces.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100622/1429190-36463_113311128716557_102796916434645_85175_5341390_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1429190\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/100622/1429190-36463_113311128716557_102796916434645_85175_5341390_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1429190\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100622/1429190-36463_113311128716557_102796916434645_85175_5341390_n.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The gameplay is an interesting mix of the old and the new, and it works shockingly well.</figcaption></figure>     It is in the action that GoldenEye retains that ever nebulous but all-important  \"feel\" of the original title. It's hard to nail down exactly what it is  that the game does, but everything from the feel of the guns, to the  pace and design of the levels, just feels...correct. That's not to say  there aren't caveats. Stealth is not an overly effective mechanic in  this game, as headshots don't always seem like they work correctly,  often relegating you to melee attacks, and sometimes you'll get spotted  creeping around for no discernible reason. At the same time, the  run-and-gun gameplay is simply a wonderfully enjoyable mix of old school  mechanics mixed with updated technology. I felt like I was playing a  classic game, not an <i>old </i>game, if that makes any sense at all.<br/> <br/> The single-player campaign is a largely enjoyable one. It's got a decent  length to it, and multiple difficulties to play through, with  additional (and, unfortunately, largely hidden) objectives tossed into  the higher levels. A few levels go on for a bit too long and throw a few  too many waves of bad guys at you, but the overall pace of the game is a  good one. For the most part, the game handles well no matter what  control scheme you choose--it supports the Wii Remote/Nunchuk combo,  both types of classic controllers, as well as the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-23\" href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" slug=\"gamecube\">       GameCube </a> controller--though personally, I found that accuracy got a little more  scattershot when I was playing around with the Wii Remote. Fortunately, there are myriad controller setting options to play around with and tweak, so you're bound to find some setting you're comfy with.<br/> <br/> While the single-player game is all fine and dandy, GoldenEye ain't  GoldenEye without multiplayer. Eurocom was good enough to include both  the classic four-player, split-screen brand of play, as well as online  play for up to eight players. The split-screen action is pretty much the  brand of GoldenEye multiplayer you'll remember. You can choose from a  variety of character skins (yes, including that jerk <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4352\" href=\"/oddjob/3005-4352/\" slug=\"oddjob\">        Oddjob</a>), as well as  several game modifiers, including such gems as Hotshot (all headshots,  all the time) and paintball (so stupid, but so weirdly enjoyable). The  maps are smaller to accommodate the smaller player roster, and the  action itself is nearly every bit the hoot it was back in the N64 era.  Is it quite the dorm-room classic it was back in the late '90s? Not  quite, but if you have any nostalgia for this mode, you're bound to have  some fun with it.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1441768-7_goldeneye_trailer_hdh264_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1441768\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1441768-7_goldeneye_trailer_hdh264_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1441768\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1441768-7_goldeneye_trailer_hdh264_15.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1441768-7_goldeneye_trailer_hdh264_15.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Reminding you of college much?</figcaption></figure>     Online play goes in a decidedly more modern direction. The mode's ten  maps are markedly larger, and a variety of different game modes are  available. You've got your typical single and team deathmatch options,  as well as such modes as Golden Gun (the holder of the golden gun gets  more points for kills, can kill with one shot), GoldenEye (teams try to  capture specific satellite stations in order to move the GoldenEye  weapon over the opposing base) and Black Box (MI6 team members attempt  to destroy a black box full of classified data, while the opposing team  tries to keep it alive so they can download data from it). All of these  modes are fun in their own right, and the game's leveling system is a  good incentive to keep coming back to play again and again. Taking a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">       Call of Duty</a> cue, you earn XP with every match you play, and as you  level up, you can earn new guns, as well as gadgets, which are  essentially the game's answer to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-366\" href=\"/perks/3015-366/\" slug=\"perks\">   perks.</a> They'll boost your accuracy,  your speed, give you more grenades, and so on and so forth. Leveling up  can be a time-consuming process, but the progression of the rewards  system is such that you're never too far away from some new thing to add  to your repertoire. <br/> <br/> If GoldenEye 007 wasn't called GoldenEye 007, people would likely not  know entirely what to make of it, perhaps viewing it as an interesting,  entertaining curiosity. People would find a game that felt decidedly  like a shooter from a bygone era, yet with a number of more modern  elements tossed in to counteract a bit of that antiquated feel. In that  regard, I think this game being a GoldenEye remake actually helps  contextualize the experience. You understand from that title why this  game feels the way it does, and if you're the sort with any fond  memories of the original, this remake seems tailor-made to put a smile  on your face. At the same time, thanks to the rock-solid gameplay  contained within, specific knowledge of the original game is not  required to enjoy it.

As a  demonstration of technology, Kinect Adventures is mostly successful.  However, as a game, its qualities are a bit more scattershot.<br/> <br/> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7580/1625026-kinect_adventures_game.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1625026\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7580/1625026-kinect_adventures_game.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1625026\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7580/1625026-kinect_adventures_game.jpeg\"></a><figcaption> Kinect Adventures does little more than a serviceable job of showcasing Kinect's technology...and making you look silly in the process.</figcaption></figure>     Each of Kinect Adventures' five minigames revolves exclusively around  you jumping, ducking, side-stepping around, and periodically flailing  your limbs like a positive lunatic in order to collect \"pins,\" which are  basically the game's version of points. The best of these games finds  ways to integrate a variety of these motions over the course of each  play. The worst rely on you doing the same stuff over and over again,  just in different positions. It's roughly a 50-50 split between  either end of the spectrum.<br/> <br/> The games that work the best are River Rush and Reflex Ridge. River Rush  puts you on a raft that sails down one of a few different obstacle  courses. You'll be side-stepping to steer and jumping in the air a lot  to collect congregations of pins scattered throughout each course.  Reflex Ridge also has you riding something (in this case an on-rails  cart) while dodging various obstacles via jumping, ducking and  side-stepping, as well as jumping around and contorting your body to  collect the maximum numbers of pins. Again, what both these games have  going from them is that each course finds a way to keep you guessing  about which types of obstacles are about to come your way. These are  also easily the best workout you'll get in Kinect Adventures, if that's  the sort of thing you're into.<br/> <br/> On the opposing side are 20,000 Leaks and Space Pop. In 20,000 Leaks,  you're in a glass tank underwater, and dickish fish keep wandering up to  crack the glass and spring leaks. You plug those leaks by contorting  your body to cover them up. That's it. While it does make for some  amusing body humor to watch people make these goofy positions, it's  barely enough of a game to amuse beyond the first couple of  play-throughs. Space Pop is lousy for different reasons. You're in a  space station, and bubbles start flooding the room in various  configurations. Because it's space, you can float around the room by  flapping your arms, and drop back to the ground by pulling your hands to  the side. While there's a bit more game here, it's also a colossal  bore. At no point does the game ever find a way to make this act  exciting or even amusing.<br/> <br/> Sitting somewhere in the middle is Rally Ball, one of the first bits of  Kinect technology Microsoft ever showed, and by far the most  tech-demo-ish element of the game. This is basically human <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\" href=\"/breakout/3030-13049/\" slug=\"breakout\">  Breakout</a>,  where you're handed a dodgeball and tasked with tossing it at a bunch  of moving targets while returning the ball over and over again by moving  your limbs around the play space. Again, there's not an awful lot to  this game. Hitting bonus targets will return volleys of balls back at  you, which can be a little hectic, but by and large this whole game is  just about arm and leg flailing. That said, it's a lot more satisfying  to play (and fun to watch) than the two previously mentioned games.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7580/1625022-216152_1.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1625022\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56101694915254\" data-width=\"590\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7580/1625022-216152_1.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1625022\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7580/1625022-216152_1.jpeg\"></a><figcaption> The whole living statues thing feels like it came from a completely different (and markedly more insane) game.</figcaption></figure>     The best thing you can say about any of these games is that the  technology largely works as it should. I only ran into a few weird bits  of my on-screen avatar flipping out due to me being unable to get into  the position the game wanted me to get in (possibly due to couch-based  constraints). That said, technology alone does not a game make. The lack  of variety and mixed level of quality of the minigames in Kinect  Adventures ultimately drags the experience down a few pegs. This becomes  especially clear the longer you spend playing the game's adventure  mode. While it does a decent job of mixing up the objectives with  timing- and collection-based goals, the repetition of the same  games over and over, with only moderate increases in difficulty to  differentiate each play-through, makes the adventure mode feel like a  lackluster grind. The rewards for playing also aren't terribly enticing,  with perhaps the sole exception of the game's inexplicable living  statue concept. What is a living statue? I could try and explain, but  perhaps it's better to <a data-ref-id=\"2300-3459\" href=\"/the-living-statues-of-kinect-adventures/2300-3459/\" slug=\"the-living-statues-of-kinect-adventures\">    watch</a>...<br/> <br/> By the dual standards one generally judges a pack-in title  by--specifically, whether the game showcases the newfangled technology  you're purchasing alongside it appropriately, and whether or not it's  any fun--Kinect Adventures comes up a bit short. While the technology is  certainly sound, nothing on display here makes an overly compelling  argument for the merits of Kinect, and though some of the games are  fun--more so in multiplayer--too few of them are strong enough to keep  the experience from wafting into the realm of the monotonous. New  Kinect owners will undoubtedly have some fun early on with it, but Kinect  Adventures seems destined to be more or less forgotten by the time the  next wave of titles hits store shelves.", "deck": "Microsoft's Kinect pack-in is a middling minigame collection that bores as often as it amuses.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-340/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31704/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/kinect-adventures/3030-31704/", "id": 31704, "name": "Kinect Adventures!"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-11-08 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-105172/", "id": 105172, "name": "Kinect Adventures"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-review/1900-341/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1470522-victor_charlie_attack1_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470522\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.67890625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1470522-victor_charlie_attack1_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470522\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1470522-victor_charlie_attack1_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Frank Woods: total badass.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26423\" href=\"/call-of-duty-black-ops/3030-26423/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-black-ops\">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> makes a lot of ambitious changes to things around the outside edges of the action while leaving the core campaign and multiplayer components largely intact. It's got a lot of great moments, but portions of the story feel cliched and hokey. Also, this is now the fourth game out of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a> that has used the same style of combat to power its campaign and multiplayer. The formula, as awesome as it can still be, is starting to wear thin.<br/> <br/> That's not to say that Black Ops doesn't have a lot of new tricks up its sleeve. The story found in the campaign feels like a solid departure from what's come before it. Set in the same universe as <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1488\" href=\"/treyarch/3010-1488/\" slug=\"treyarch\">Treyarch</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20777\" href=\"/call-of-duty-world-at-war/3030-20777/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-world-at-war\">Call of Duty: World At War</a>, Black Ops doesn't spend much time weaving different playable characters together into a single narrative. Instead, you play the majority of the game as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17021\" href=\"/alex-mason/3005-17021/\" slug=\"alex-mason\">Alex Mason</a>, a special ops guy who's hooked up with the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2988\" href=\"/central-intelligence-agency/3015-2988/\" slug=\"central-intelligence-agency\">CIA</a> to do dirty work anywhere it needs doing, and missions where you don't control Mason are there to fill in some gaps or tell Mason's tale from a different angle. The game is set over a large chunk of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1888\" href=\"/cold-war/3015-1888/\" slug=\"cold-war\">Cold War</a>, opening with a Cuban raid as you attempt to assassinate <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10343\" href=\"/fidel-castro/3005-10343/\" slug=\"fidel-castro\">Castro</a>. For taking on that mission, you quickly end up locked away in a Siberian prison, and the globetrotting begins. As much of the game is told via flashback, Mason's adventures are able to cover a wide period of time, taking you up to the war in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-40\" href=\"/vietnam/3035-40/\" slug=\"vietnam\">Vietnam</a> and beyond. Since we're dealing with the past, you'll encounter a few characters from real-life history, too, which feels really out of place, considering all of the over-the-top theatrics you're performing across the rest of the game.<br/> <br/> To be clear, Black Ops is <i>not</i> a Vietnam game. But the middle of it most definitely is, complete with cliched examples of licensed music from the era. At one point, you're traveling down a river, blasting \"Sympathy For The Devil\" by the Rolling Stones. I just sort of rolled my eyes at this point. They aren't always directly related to the music, most of which is really great, but the campaign is full of moments that just don't fit. The action, meanwhile, is fairly standard. There are a lot of guys to shoot, and all that shooting gets broken up by a few larger set-pieces, including one where the game sort of turns into a real-time strategy game for a few minutes as you order a squad around from the cockpit of an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4063\" href=\"/sr-71-blackbird/3055-4063/\" slug=\"sr-71-blackbird\">SR-71</a>. There were also a couple of baffling moments that just feel like they're underexplained by the game. In one case, you need to run up to barrels full of napalm and interact with them to take out some enemies. But the game isn't clear that running up to them is the way to proceed, so I found myself shooting the barrels, running around the barrels, running past the barrels, and so on until I stumbled upon the trigger needed to make the game move forward.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1403320-tr_callofdutyblackopseminemremix_700_48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1403320-tr_callofdutyblackopseminemremix_700_48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403320\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1403320-tr_callofdutyblackopseminemremix_700_48.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It wouldn't be 'Nam without a chopper or two. At one point you'll fly one for yourself. </figcaption></figure>     But it's the multiplayer side of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> that keeps people coming back year after year, right? The list of modes in the team-based multiplayer component hasn't really changed. Yes, Headquarters is still Headquarters. There are some gameplay changes to consider, though. You can dive to a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-622\" href=\"/prone/3015-622/\" slug=\"prone\">prone</a> position by hitting the stance change button while running. This is especially fun when used to dive through windows, and there's an in-game challenge that'll get you some bonus experience points for diving through five of them. But by and large, it's the same game, new maps. There are some great maps in the game, like Nuketown, a 1950s-style neighborhood with mannequins hanging around. Oh, and at the end of every match, a nuke goes off and destroys the level. Other maps give you a larger playfield, like Jungle, which has a small, wooden bridge at its center with enough ways to get to it that anyone crossing the bridge tends to get gunned down pretty quickly. There are 14 multiplayer maps to choose from. <br/> <br/>Most of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4056\" href=\"/kill-streak-reward/3015-4056/\" slug=\"kill-streak-reward\">killstreaks</a>, perks, and equipment you'd expect to find in a Call of Duty game appear in Black Ops, though there are some notable changes. On the killstreak side, nukes are out and dogs (boo!) are in. There's also a new remote control car killstreak bonus that lets you control a little buggy with the aim of driving it up to a foe and making him and the car blow up. It's kind of annoying and it only requires three kills, so those little things are liable to be everywhere. Deathstreaks are completely gone. Perks are definitely present, but the pro versions of the perks take more work to unlock. Still, I found gaining the ability to get my gun back up more quickly after coming out of a run to be insanely invaluable. Some of the pro bonuses are, as before, very nice. While all this stuff is present, how you'll get it is a bit different this year.<br/> <br/> A lot of the changes to how the multiplayer functions takes place outside of the game. The player progression has been broken into two pieces. Now, leveling up merely unlocks the ability to purchase additional weapons, perks, equipment, attachments, and, well, just about everything else. You'll have to spend your \"COD points\" to actually use any of that stuff. On one hand, this is nice because it lets you skip the items that don't fit with the way you play. For example, I have no desire to use gas grenades or sniper rifles. So I can focus my purchases on assault rifles and LMGs. The downside to this is that you don't feel the same thrill when you gain a level. By the time I was level 20 or so, I felt like I had unlocked just about everything to make my class function the way I like, leaving me with a lot less to look forward to. At least the pro versions of the perks are significantly tougher to unlock in many cases, giving you something significant to grind on. You can also gamble with your COD points using a contract system, which gives you a set amount of time--like 40 minutes of in-game time, in some cases--to complete specific tasks, like getting five headshots with a specific weapon or planting the bomb a certain number of times, and so on. You have to spend money to buy these contracts, and you only get paid if you complete the task before your time expires. The challenges appear to rotate on a regular basis, giving you new things to try over time, if you're so inclined. But that's not the only way you can lose all of your money.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1546941-5944_01_2251_20100311_e7mf1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1546941\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1546941-5944_01_2251_20100311_e7mf1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1546941\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1546941-5944_01_2251_20100311_e7mf1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1546941-5944_01_2251_20100311_e7mf1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The crossbow is useful if you want to stay quiet, but you can strap explosives to your bolts if you want to go very, very loud.</figcaption></figure>     The main new multiplayer thing in Black Ops is set of six-player free-for-all modes that fall under the heading of Wager Match. In these modes, you pony up some of your COD points as an ante, and the top three players in the round get a portion of the overall pot. These modes play around with how the weapons are used and acquired, so in Gun Game, you'll all start with basic pistols, but each kill upgrades you to a new gun, and the first player to cycle through all 20 guns (which includes the crossbow, one of the new weapons found in the game) wins. I think my favorite is One in the Chamber, which gives everyone a pistol with only one bullet. If you kill another player, you earn another bullet. So if you're out of ammo, you'll need to knife someone to rearm yourself or lose one of your three lives. It's a tense battle, because accuracy becomes so, so key. The wager-based modes feel like little mods and, in fact, Gun Game was actually a somewhat popular Counter-Strike mod. It's interesting to see the developers take a fresh stab at free-for-all play, considering that team-based modes effectively rule the shooter landscape in this day and age. It's a cool addition, but considering that most of the key items you'll unlock for multiplayer don't cost that much, it's not really something you'll need to turn to for additional funds too often.<br/> <br/> Black Ops has a file-sharing and video editing setup similar to the tools found in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\" href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" slug=\"halo-3\">Halo 3</a>. Your matches are automatically saved, and if you like, you can go in and watch any other player's recent matches. You can also chop up smaller clips, fiddle with speed and camera angles, and save the files out to your file share, which has six slots for your saved films, screens, and custom game modes. While you can customize modes for private matches, the tools at your disposal feel fairly basic when you compare them to what <a data-ref-id=\"3010-476\" href=\"/bungie-studios/3010-476/\" slug=\"bungie-studios\">Bungie</a>'s been doing with Halo for the past few years, but hey, it's a start.<br/> <br/> The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3023\" href=\"/nazi-zombies/3015-3023/\" slug=\"nazi-zombies\">Nazi Zombies</a> mode found in World At War returns in Black Ops, and you'll find two maps available for online play once you've completed the single-player campaign. Each map is setup with a little video, and each one has you play as a unique set of characters, giving each map its own \"zombie team.\" Perhaps this is an unpopular stance, but I really didn't like the zombie mode in World At War, and it's not much better here. All it does here is make me miss the Spec Ops mode found in Modern Warfare 2, which I found to be a much more exciting cooperative mode. There's also a Combat Training mode that lets you go up against bots in deathmatch or team deathmatch, which would be a great option for players out there that don't have Internet connections... but for whatever reason, the mode is only available when you're connected to a network.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11763/588147-icecube1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-588147\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"375\" style=\"width: 375px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11763/588147-icecube1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-588147\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11763/588147-icecube1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11763/588147-icecube1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hearing Cube gripe about how my tactical insertion was destroyed is probably one of my favorite parts of the entire game. </figcaption></figure>     Moments of Black Ops look fantastic, and Treyarch's signature fire technology shines yet again, whether you're using a barrel-mounted flamethrower or just blowing things up. You'll find some sharp lighting in spots, and much of the character animation is solid. A few textures here and there look a little grungy, but it's easy to forgive some of its shortcomings when you consider the game's solid, smooth frame rate. You can opt to sacrifice a lot of that frame rate to play in a 3D mode, but I didn't find the tradeoff to be worth it at all. There are some moments that look really cool when you're playing on a proper 3D setup, but the Call of Duty series is all about that great frame rate. Without it, the entire experience suffers, even if you're getting some new depth from the 3D display.<br/> <br/> The audio is largely fantastic. Gun reports, especially ones in the distance, really stand out nicely, and much of the voice acting helps sell the campaign. It's helped out by some big names, like <a data-ref-id=\"3040-99127\" href=\"/ed-harris/3040-99127/\" slug=\"ed-harris\">Ed Harris</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-7892\" href=\"/ice-cube/3040-7892/\" slug=\"ice-cube\">Ice Cube</a>. But it's also hampered by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-99173\" href=\"/sam-worthington/3040-99173/\" slug=\"sam-worthington\">Sam Worthington</a>, who voices Alex Mason in such an awful, inconsistent way that by the end I was wondering if Mason (said to be a native of Alaska in the game's backstory) was Australian. Maybe it's just the horrors of interrogation, right? As I said before, a lot of the game's music is also fantastic, setting up the intense sequences with pounding tracks that don't try to be period-appropriate. The smattering of licensed music found in the game just sort of gets in the way, and makes you feel like the game is trying too hard to be compared to Vietnam-era films.<br/> <br/> I'm usually not too big on bonus material, but Black Ops does a great job with its intel items. You'll get a couple of microfilm-style pages for each mission, and collecting intel items in those levels removes the redactions that prevent you from reading the text. This helps sell the covert CIA vibe that the game is attempting to pull off really nicely. Also, there's a hidden terminal in the game that lets you read e-mail and hack the accounts of world leaders to read theirs, as well. The terminal feels more fully featured than it probably needs to be--it even has a command history. You can unlock a couple of bonus games here, too, including an overhead twin-stick shooters and a classic text adventure. Though comparing a game to Enter the Matrix is usually seen as a bad thing, it's similar to the computer terminal found in that game, and it's very cool, even if reading <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10744\" href=\"/john-f-kennedy/3005-10744/\" slug=\"john-f-kennedy\">JFK</a>'s e-mail feels ridiculously anachronistic.<br/> <br/> Do you want to play more Call of Duty? I'm guessing the answer is yes, and by all means, Black Ops is worth playing. But for all its ambitious steps to set itself apart from the previous games, it flounders in a few too many of those areas to be a total success. Even with those flaws, though, the heart of the series--its competitive multiplayer--lives on quite well, which should be enough to satisfy most fans of the franchise.    ", "deck": "Black Ops takes the kitchen sink approach by throwing in a ton of modes and options, but the core action remains mostly intact.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-341/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26423/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-black-ops/3030-26423/", "id": 26423, "name": "Call of Duty: Black Ops"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-11-09 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-91887/", "id": 91887, "name": "Call of Duty: Black Ops"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dance-central-review/1900-342/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1403359-tr_dancecentrale3_fix_061410_1500_32.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403359\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1403359-tr_dancecentrale3_fix_061410_1500_32.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403359\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1403359-tr_dancecentrale3_fix_061410_1500_32.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The boombox keeps track of your score. The boombox sees all.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31705\" href=\"/dance-central/3030-31705/\" slug=\"dance-central\">Dance Central</a> is successful both as a rhythm game and as a good bit of proof that the brand-new <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\" href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" slug=\"kinect-support\">Kinect</a> sensor for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">Xbox 360</a> is a functional piece of cool technology. The game does a fine job of detecting your body, using that data to judge your ability to mimic on-screen dancers through a variety of songs and routines. Though it's a little thin on modes and options other than picking a song and dancing, the baseline gameplay is good enough to make Dance Central the game to have if you buy a Kinect.<br/> <br/> That baseline gameplay has you moving your body around to match a pre-set routine. The routine is made up of many different types of moves, each of which is broken down and listed on a \"flash card\" that appears on the right side of the screen. Almost like the \"next\" box in a Tetris game, you can also see the next couple of flashcards, giving you time to get ready for a transition when you're done with the current step. These individual moves range from incredibly simple stuff, like stepping side-to-side in time with the music all the way up to full spins, jazz squares, and so on. The closer you are to the game's expectations, the better you score. If you're off, limbs on the game's on-screen dancer begin to glow red, quickly letting you know what you're getting wrong. This feedback system is great and the whole thing feels like a big step forward for the dance game genre, largely because the game is actually looking at your entire body instead of your actions on a floor mat or how you can move a motion controller. You feel like you're actually up there dancing, and the game is accurate enough to judge you on your full-body performance, rather than just extrapolating your moves from whatever limited input it can gather.<br/> <br/> While it's possible to correct your mistakes on the fly, your best bet at success is to prepare for the dance ahead of time. For that, there's a mode called \"Break It Down,\" where you're taken through a song's specific steps, one at a time, and are given the chance to practice them a few times. If you nail them on the first try, the practice mode moves on, but if you're having trouble, it'll slow down and spend a little time with you on those moves. This is available for the easy, medium, and hard settings on each song.<br/> <br/> Though every individual song is open to you right from the beginning of the game, Dance Central does lock away some of its content behind a very basic progression. At the outset, you'll only be able to dance the easy version of a song. If you get at least three of the five stars available for that song, you'll unlock medium. Doing that on medium gets you the hard version of the dance. The difference in difficulty is mostly that the easy dances have you repeating the easier parts of a routine instead of getting into the trickier steps. As you move up, basic sidesteps and claps are replaced with more elaborate moves. Difficulty is definitely relative, though, as some songs are just inherently more difficult than others. I suspect it'll be a case where some players are better at some songs and worse at others, depending on your individual dance weakness. My coordination lapses occur when I have to cross things up, like using my right arm and my left leg simultaneously. If I break the moves down in the practice mode, though, it's usually something I can warm up to. Overall, most of the dances seem doable, but it'll probably help if you already have at least a basic sense of rhythm to know when to expect changes and such.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1403344-tr_dancecentrale3_fix_061410_1500_19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403344\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1403344-tr_dancecentrale3_fix_061410_1500_19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403344\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1403344-tr_dancecentrale3_fix_061410_1500_19.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of the steps are a lot easier than others, but practice makes perfect. </figcaption></figure>     The other modes include the ability to turn off flashcards, a basic workout mode that gives you a quick and dirty calorie counter as you play, and a two-player mode that doesn't actually let two players dance at the same time. Instead, it's a dance battle, where one player dances a sequence, then changes out with the other player during a freestyle section. Then the other player dances the same sequence, and the song continues. It's not a great substitute for a proper simultaneous mode, but considering how much movement you're doing while you're up there, it's easy to see how dancing alongside someone else could be very, very dangerous.<br/> <br/> Dance Central also has one of the best interfaces of any of the Kinect launch games. Instead of forcing you to hold your hand over a button and leave it there for way too long, you move your hands up and down to move through the menus, and then \"slap\" at the screen from right to left to select an item. It's a much faster solution... though even nicer is the way the game just lets you pick up a controller and make the selections normally, if you'd like.<br/> <br/> There's a nice variety of danceable music in the game, though like all things, it begins and ends with Lady Gaga. \"Poker Face\" is the easiest, first song on the list while \"Just Dance\" is the last. Different types of hip-hop, electronic, dance, and R&amp;B music can be found here alongside a handful of straight-up pop songs. Even the songs that I found personally distasteful--Soulja Boy's \"Crank Dat\" comes to mind--were still fun in-game. The game also launched with some downloadable additions, which just integrate themselves into the song list and sort by difficulty, just like the rest. Each difficulty tier culminates in a bit of a mash-up, where you'll perform steps from all of the songs in one session. It's a neat idea, but the way the songs grind together isn't especially graceful, so these mixes sort of jerk from one song to the next. Also, a lot of the songs have been edited for length.<br/> <br/> The game offers different backgrounds and different dancers, and these look pretty good, but you aren't going to be blown away by how the game presents itself. Watching and copying the dancer is core to the gameplay, so the camera is locked down during the game, and there aren't any particularly flashy effects. Overall, it has a functional look with some nice dancer designs and animation.<br/> <br/> Dance Central feels very basic and leaves a lot of room for future expansion, but it's also a lot of fun in its current state. It's also one of the best Kinect games out there, so if you've got one of those, make sure you pick up one of these, as well.", "deck": "Dance Central is a lot of fun, but the game surrounding the dancing feels really basic.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-342/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31705/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dance-central/3030-31705/", "id": 31705, "name": "Dance Central"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-11-10 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-102897/", "id": 102897, "name": "Dance Central"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/kinect-sports-review/1900-343/", "description": "<p style=\"\">I think it's safe to say we can all blame <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">        Nintendo</a> for thrusting the  once barely-existent sports minigame collection into the limelight as  the benchmark by which all motion-controlling technologies are judged.

I don't really know if making painstaking judgments about which  game/system features the superior rendition of table tennis is really  the way to be properly stacking these technologies against one another,  but at the very least, the publisher-produced versions of these games do  tend to make for solid showings of the technology they're built around,  and can occasionally be pretty fun to boot.<br/> <br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-31703\" href=\"/kinect-sports/3030-31703/\" slug=\"kinect-sports\"></a> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2121/1515831-kinect_sports_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1515831\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2121/1515831-kinect_sports_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1515831\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2121/1515831-kinect_sports_5.jpg\"></a><figcaption> To punch dudes in boxing, you, well, punch dudes.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31703\" href=\"/kinect-sports/3030-31703/\" slug=\"kinect-sports\">  Kinect Sports</a> is Microsoft's stab at the genre for its newly  released motion-tracking camera. Developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-174\" href=\"/rare-ltd/3010-174/\" slug=\"rare-ltd\"> Rare</a> shows that it has a  fairly firm grip on the Kinect tech, creating a solid variety of  sporting minigames that each require unique and energetic movements from  the player. This is one of those games that pretty much requires  additional players to really be worth your while, but if you do have  some companions to play with, Kinect Sports can be precisely the kind of  riotous party experience you would want from this type of game.<br/> <br/> Six basic games are included in this package: Boxing, beach volleyball,  table tennis, soccer, bowling, and track and field. Actually, track and  field is a competitive suite made up of five smaller games--javelin,  discus, hurdles, long jump, and sprint--so I guess you could say there  are technically eleven games. And, now that I think of it, the game also  includes \"minigames\" versions of the, erm, minigames, with differing  rule sets--how many bowling pins can you knock down in a set amount of  time, how many times can you return the ball in table tennis, etc.--so,  OK, let's just say there's a bunch of different games to play around  with.<br/> <br/> Kinect Sports has the benefit of being one of the more solid  demonstrations of the Kinect technology, in terms of functionality and  fun. All of these games work as intended, with only a touch of  noticeable input lag, and do so in ways that are almost immediately  intuitive to the player. Want to throw a discus? Wind your arm back, and  fling it forward like...well, you were throwing a discus. Hitting a  ball in table tennis, throwing a bowling ball down the lane, punching a  dude in boxing, all this stuff works in ways that, were the helpful  tutorials not there, would mostly make sense from a practical standpoint.  Even the slightly more abstracted stuff, like sprinting or long jumping,  makes sense as you simply run in place and jump in the air when  required. The only game that is maybe a little too abstracted for its  own good is soccer, which is less a game of soccer and more a game of  you standing in place, and kicking the ball toward another player,  eventually getting the goal. Again, it works fine, but it's not a great  deal of fun.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99198/1452466-kinectsports4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452466\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.565\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99198/1452466-kinectsports4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452466\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99198/1452466-kinectsports4.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Try bowling against the hardest AI difficulty, and you are entering a world of pain.</figcaption></figure>     Still, that's one blemish among a group of games that are largely a  hoot--at least in a multiplayer scenario. The single-player experience  in Kinect Sports is a touch lacking, sadly. It's not that the games  don't provide an ample challenge to the solo player. In fact, if you  crank the difficulty up, you can get into some really tough games  against the computer--perhaps a little too tough once you get up to  Champion difficulty. It's fun to feel challenged, but when you're  getting regularly smoked by a computer opponent that knows how to nail  practically every shot in volleyball and can bowl like eight or nine  strikes in a given game, your enjoyment tends to flatline.<br/> <br/> But in multiplayer, that's far less of a concern, and really, that's how  these games are meant to be played. As with other Kinect titles, the  game can only handle two players on screen at once, but there's a nice  array of competitive and cooperative options for various games across  the board. Want to play some cooperative doubles table tennis? Or just  punch some people in the face online? You can, and should.<br/> <br/> I'll go so far as to say that the genre of sports-themed minigame  collections probably isn't capable of really being revolutionized, but  Kinect Sports gets dangerously close, simply by virtue of doing the one  thing other motion-controlling technologies haven't been able to yet:  Tracking your feet. This is far more of a full-body workout than  something like a Wii Sports, and best of all, it's a fairly fun workout  at that. It would be entirely understandable if seasoned players who  have already run the gamut of previously released mini-sports titles  like this one might balk at the notion if picking up yet another one.  But if you've invested in a Kinect and you're looking for a nifty,  well-put-together party game to show off your fancy new gadget, this is  about as good as anything you're going to find in the system's launch  lineup.", "deck": "The quality of the games and implementation of the Kinect technology in Kinect Sports make this sports-themed minigame collection more than just another genre also-ran.

The first was a bold, if not entirely sure footed venture that, while hampered by an eventually laborious lack of variety and an abundance of rough edges, still established an interesting sci-fi premise and showed the promise of the fluid, stealth-driven open-world mechanics beneath it all.

Frankly, I found myself so engrossed in the nuts and bolts of the world itself that a lot of the specific story beats were kind of a blur--I was less interested in the specific whos and the whys of my murderous pursuits than I was the actual execution. In a way, the predestined nature of Ezio’s story makes it not really matter in the grand scheme, though the final moments with Desmond left me feeling baffled by the mop of loose ends it rather deliberately leaves cliff-hung. <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1524371-996092_20100614_790screen011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524371\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56329113924051\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1524371-996092_20100614_790screen011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524371\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1524371-996092_20100614_790screen011.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The kills come quicker in Brotherhood.</figcaption></figure>     A quick intro video recaps the big bullet points of the story so far for those who haven’t kept up or simply forgot. Similarly, the first several hours of Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood are uncharacteristically linear, spending ample time easing you into the particular feel of the Assassin’s Creed movement and combat, while also introducing you to the new stuff. The basic handling no different from Assassin’s Creed II, and by and large, you’re performing the same types of tasks--sneaking through the dense streets and gymnastic rooftops, coolly tracking and assassinating specific targets, and juggling groups of enemy combatants. The group combat has never been Assassin’s Creed’s strongest point, though Brotherhood streamlines it in a way that makes stringing together one-hit kills an absolute breeze. This allows you to chew through your enemies, which, in kind, lets the game throw more enemies at you. It doesn’t really address the fundamentally shallow feel, but the satisfaction of watching Ezio fluidly conduct his dark business certainly helps take some of the edge off. <br/> <br/>A lot of the activities introduced in Assassin’s Creed II are expanded on, or at the very least, multiplied. The real-estate angle from ACII has been opened up to let you purchase dozens of blacksmiths, art dealers, banks, and clothing stores, all the way up to actual Roman landmarks like the Pantheon and the Colosseum, with each purchase increasing your periodic income. Before you can start getting your <a data-ref-id=\"3025-887\" href=\"/monopoly/3025-887/\" slug=\"monopoly\">     Monopoly </a>on, you need to rid the area of the Borgias' corrupting influence by destroying their tower in the district, a task which adds a little assassination mission to the tower-climbing business that has been an Assassin’s Creed staple. Unlike Assassin’s Creed II, you can now replay any story mission out of order, and each mission now has a secondary win condition, such as never breaking stealth or executing enemies in a specific fashion. There are side missions and challenges to be taken from thieves, mercenaries, and courtesans, a fun series of missions tasking you with stealing, using, and destroying some fantastical da Vinci-built war machines that the Borgia have in their possession, pickpockets and Borgia agents to chase around the city, shop-specific collection goals, and just a load of posters, feathers, flags, and treasure chests to be collected. At a certain point, the world of Brotherhood opens up, and it kind of never stops blossoming, and it constantly introduces something new to do. When you pull up the map to try and decide what you’re going to do next, it can be downright overwhelming. This is not a short game, and while I didn’t stick to the critical path, I probably spent a good 20 hours with Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, and the mad completionists out there will surely put that number to shame. <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1524388-996093_20100916_790screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524388\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1524388-996093_20100916_790screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524388\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1524388-996093_20100916_790screen005.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1524388-996093_20100916_790screen005.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Leonardo has some wonderful new toys for you to play with.</figcaption></figure>     Depending on your play style and how much time you spend on all the stuff outside the main story missions, it might be a while before you get to start recruiting and training your own brotherhood of assassins, something that’s new to Brotherhood and easily my favorite addition. As you’re running your vicious errands around Rome, you’ll find citizens fighting it out with the corrupt city guards, and if you rescue them, they’ll pledge allegiance to your cause. Once recruited, you can earn more money and build up the experience of your individual assassins by sending them out on jobs across <a data-ref-id=\"3035-289\" href=\"/europe/3035-289/\" slug=\"europe\">    Europe</a>. Any assassins that aren’t out on assignment, though, can be used to take care of any enemies you don’t want to dirty your hands with, simply by targeting the enemies in question and tapping a button. It really compounds the cool confidence Ezio has when you watch him raise his hand and then calmly stroll by as his minions appear out of nowhere and explore his enemies’ head and body cavities with various razor-sharp implements. Through the entire game, it never failed to elicit a satisfied chuckle from me when an assassin would just hop out of the nearest haystack or simply fall from the sky ready to do some pro-grade stabbin’, but there are a number of missions designed to necessitate their use. The only adjustment in Brotherhood that cut the wrong way for me was the decision to put horses inside the city limits. Rome is a massive city with significant tracts of open space that are well-suited for short bursts of the kind of horseback riding seen in the previous games, but they just don’t fit in the dense alleys and abundant staircases of the city’s urban centers. There’s even a new fast-travel system that doesn’t shrink the city too much, but which makes the horses feel at least somewhat redundant. <br/> <br/>The biggest gamble in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood is the new multiplayer mode, which goes to some pretty clever lengths to adopt something recognizable as the Assassin’s Creed gameplay into a player-versus-player experience. The premise here is that all of the players are <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2653\" href=\"/abstergo-industries/3015-2653/\" slug=\"abstergo-industries\"> Abstergo </a>trainees being taught in the ways of the assassins with networked Animus scenarios designed to help them better understand their enemy. This makes room for the biggest contrivance in the multiplayer, albeit a necessary one. Games can support up to eight players, and as such, there are eight different player models to choose from, and only one player can use one of those models in any given game. The levels are then populated exclusively with benign AI versions of the models, providing you with crowds of pedestrians to blend in with. There are a few different free-for-all and team-based configurations, but the basic idea is that everyone is given a specific player to assassinate, making everyone both hunter and hunted, creating this cat-and-mouse Mobius strip of sorts. In addition to your target’s face, you’re also provided with a simple directional compass that provides a general idea of where and how far away they are, though at a certain point you have to use your skills of observation to figure out who’s a real person and who’s AI.  <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1524381-996092_20100615_790screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524381\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1524381-996092_20100615_790screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524381\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1524381-996092_20100615_790screen001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1524381-996092_20100615_790screen001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Hakuna Matata!</figcaption></figure>     That you’re constantly looking over your shoulder creates a terrific sense of tension, and there’s an interesting dynamic of balancing how quickly to approach your target without betraying yourself as a live target to whoever’s hunting <i>you.</i> The whole thing’s outfitted with a persistent experience system that grants you rechargeable abilities like a brief sprinting boost and additional slots to have multiple abilities active at once. It probably ends up working better than it really ought to, and I’ll admit that I found it particularly satisfying to be able to shout “UH!” at my live opponent as I slipped a dagger into his ribcage, though it’s still more of a novelty than a serious multiplayer contender. There’s good variety in the small number of maps included, but there’s not many of them, and the four modes don’t cover much ground. More importantly, with the tools provided, it’s remarkably easier to hunt down your targets than it is to evade assassination, and it makes the experience feel a little lopsided. <br/> <br/>Brotherhood lacks that generational leap we saw from Assassin’s Creed to Assassin’s Creed II, but it more than makes up for that with a full-bodied single-player experience teeming with interesting gameplay additions and a risky multiplayer component. Even more surprising than the single-player experience is the addition of a competitive multiplayer game that, through some downright acrobatic contrivances, manages to make the cat-and-mouse core of the single-player work with live opponents.

I wish the game offered more control options--namely, options that don't involve shaking the controller around--but overall this is a really well put-together and fantastic-looking platformer that will really challenge your ability to play hard games the way you used to way back when.<br/> <br/> I've played all the way through this game, and even I'm not sure exactly what's going on in the thin wisp of a storyline. There are some comically sinister events involving some evil jungle spirits that come out of a volcano, and then (what else) Donkey Kong's stash of bananas goes missing. That's just your excuse to run and jump Donkey and Diddy Kong across eight worlds full of pretty intense platforming levels. There's an incredible amount of visual variety from world to world, with levels set in jungle, beach, cave, prehistoric, industrial, and volcano environments, and Retro's artists have outdone themselves in bringing these areas to exaggerated life. Everything moves in a big, cartoonish way, with a ton of little animations going on in the background that make the world feel especially lively. This is up there as one of the absolute best-looking games on the Wii.<br/> <br/> The platforming action is really no slouch here, either, and if you remember anything about the old DKC games, this one is also high on the difficulty scale. It's no <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25114\" href=\"/super-meat-boy/3030-25114/\" slug=\"super-meat-boy\"> Super Meat Boy</a>, but by the end of the first world you'll know the game demands pretty tight, specific timing of you. Like in the originals, Donkey Kong can pair up with Diddy when you find him hiding out in a level, and having Diddy onboard doubles your life and also gives you a jetpack-assisted hover move that makes the jumps a lot easier to pull off.  <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405745-rvl_dkcreturns_01mov01_e3_046.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405745\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405745-rvl_dkcreturns_01mov01_e3_046.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405745\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1405745-rvl_dkcreturns_01mov01_e3_046.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The game's art design is absolutely top-notch.</figcaption></figure> The unfortunate consequence of this is that when you take a couple of hits and lose Diddy, you also lose the hover. I found myself enjoying the game a little less when Diddy wasn't around and I had no way to get him back until the next level, since the way Donkey Kong moves on his own is a little sluggish compared to the sorts of jumps and landings you sometimes have to make. If you ever get <i>really</i> frustrated, you can use Nintendo's <i>patented Super Guide technology </i>to make the game literally finish a level for you so you can just move on to the next one. You don't actually get credit for any of the collectibles in the levels you skip through, anyway, so you can still go back and accomplish them for yourself if you feel the need.<br/> <br/>     Donkey Kong Country Returns lets you play with the standard Wii Remote and Nunchuk combo, or just the Remote on its side like an NES controller (which I preferred), and mostly these controls work fine. In addition to jumping on top of enemies, you can roll forward to pick up speed quickly, pound the ground to stun enemies and interact with a lot of background elements, and make Donkey Kong blow a big puff of air to do weird things like put out the flames of enemies that are on fire. Unfortunately, you activate all three of these moves by shaking the controller, which is never as fast as just pressing a button. But the game sometimes wants you to roll or pound with really specific timing, more quickly than a controller shake really allows. I would have really appreciated Classic Controller support here, with all those abilities mapped to different buttons, but the game is playable enough with the existing controls.<br/> <br/> There's a lot of ingenious stuff going on in the level design that makes the game well worth playing through, anyway. Massive parts of levels will explode or collapse into each other on a regular basis, and you'll find yourself getting launched into the fore- and background from time to time. Between all the platforming, there are some occasional forced-scrolling levels where you're careening along in a mine cart or hurtling through the level in a barrel with a rocket jammed into it. These stages rely a little more on memorizing and anticipating the obstacles by dying repeatedly than I would have liked, but there's still a ton of fast-paced, satisfying action here.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405742-rvl_dkcreturns_01mov01_e3_045.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405742\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405742-rvl_dkcreturns_01mov01_e3_045.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405742\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1405742-rvl_dkcreturns_01mov01_e3_045.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1405742-rvl_dkcreturns_01mov01_e3_045.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The game has bosses.</figcaption></figure>     There's also a <i>ton</i> of collectibles here. Bananas give you extra lives every time you find 100 of them, and banana coins let you buy a few trinkets at <a data-ref-id=\"3005-311\" href=\"/cranky-kong/3005-311/\" slug=\"cranky-kong\"> Cranky Kong</a>'s shop in between levels. You can collect balloons for extra lives, and an enormous number of puzzle pieces and K-O-N-G pieces if you really want to do and see everything the game has to offer. Despite all this, the game felt a little on the short side to me, partially because you don't have to finish every level in a world to move on to its colorful boss and then on to the next world. You certainly <i>can</i> go back and play every level, but you could also finish each world in less than an hour if you really wanted to.<br/> <br/> Nintendo's got an uncanny knack for knowing when it might be a good time to bring one of its hallowed franchises back to the fore, and sure enough, now seems like as good a time as any for more Donkey Kong Country. And Retro has done a fine job with this new installment, which has Nintendo's trademark fit and finish all over it.

It achieves this by stripping away a lot of the extra junk that's been building up around the edges of the last several games and refocusing on actual driving. You aren't going to spend time tuning your cars, buying upgrade packages, or working your way through some hackneyed storyline in Hot Pursuit. Instead, you're going to build up your arsenal of available cars as both a racer and a cop across a set of single-player challenges and a multiplayer side that's one of the best online modes that the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-483\" href=\"/need-for-speed/3025-483/\" slug=\"need-for-speed\"> Need For Speed series</a> has ever seen.<br/> <br/> The crux of Hot Pursuit is the interplay between racers and police chasers, and at any time you'll be able to take on race events or police events, with a separate set of experience points and unlockable cars for each side. As you take on events, either offline or on, you'll earn \"bounty,\" which increases your level and gives you access to more cars across five different tiers. There are also a set of career milestones in both careers, so you'll get bounty bonuses for crashing 100 times, spending set amounts of time driving at top speed, drifting for a long time, and so on. On top of that, you'll also unlock upgraded offensive and defensive gear when you effectively use the weapons you're given when racers and cops collide.<br/> <br/> Those weapons are the thing that separates Hot Pursuit from the rest of the recent Need For Speed games. In events where both cops and racers are present, cops are given abilities like roadblocks, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-361\" href=\"/helicopter/3055-361/\" slug=\"helicopter\"> helicopters</a>, spike strips, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4910\" href=\"/electromagnetic-pulse/3015-4910/\" slug=\"electromagnetic-pulse\"> EMP</a> blasts. Calling in roadblocks and choppers lets you deal with racers from a distance, while dropping spike strips behind you or firing EMP charges ahead of you are the preferred method of dealing with nearby offenders. The racers, however, can fight back, as they have EMPs and spike strips of their own. Racers can also jam police radar and abilites with a jammer and bust out a turbo boost that's way faster than the standard nitrous oxide system fitted onto every car in the game. These powers don't turn the game into <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19071\" href=\"/super-mario-kart/3030-19071/\" slug=\"super-mario-kart\"> Super Mario Kart</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25961\" href=\"/blur/3030-25961/\" slug=\"blur\"> Blur</a>, though. The number of times you can use each ability is very limited, forcing you to be strategic about when and where you use them. They don't replenish at any point during an event, either. It gives the game a different feel than the typical weapon-based racing game, though it would have been nice to see fewer shared abilities between the two factions or some sort of loadout customization.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1465458-action3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465458\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1465458-action3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465458\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/95284/1465458-action3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>When cops and racers collide, the faster car usually wins. </figcaption></figure>     Hot Pursuit is at its best in the actual \"Hot Pursuit\" mode, where a team of racers tries to get to the finish line while the cops try to stop them. But in the career, it feels like too many of the racer goals don't have any cops at all, which turns it into a very standard, understeer-heavy racing game. And if an event is going to have a police presence, you always know that up front. A little more surprise about when and where the cops are going to try to stop your races--which is how the series has handled this in the past--would have been nice.<br/> <br/> While everything you do feeds into your experience points and unlocked cars, there's also a full career mode with a couple of different ways to attack the events. The default career just gives you a map of event locations and a \"new\" tag on a location means there's an event there you haven't tried yet. Cop and racer missions are both listed on this map, letting you freely interchange between the two. The map isn't great at letting you know what's next, though, and it sort of leaves you hunting around the screen to see what's new, rather than quickly letting you know what the next event is.<br/> <br/> The other way to move through the career is to follow your friends. The game has a set of friends leaderboards that it uses to recommend events to you. It's termed the \"Autolog,\" and it'll occasionally tell you about events you haven't tried yet, but it's more focused on letting you know when people on your friends list have beaten your times on events you've already completed. If you're the type of person that lives for beating your friends, you'll love it. But as someone who was also interested in seeing events that I hadn't seen yet, the whole Autolog feels a little underwhelming and overly in your face.<br/> <br/> The single-player events on the racer side often feel like they don't have enough cops in them, but the police side of the career is really exciting. Sometimes it places you up against a full team of racers in the Hot Pursuit events. These aren't too tough because the opposing racers are always following a race track. But the Interceptor events, which gives the AI racer the option to go anywhere and spin around at will, open things up in a cool way. Both sides have point-to-point races against the clock, but on the police side, you're penalized for collisions. Overall, the career is decent, but you're more likely to find lasting excitement via the game's online mode.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3507/1402893-997658_20100614_screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1402893\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3507/1402893-997658_20100614_screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1402893\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3507/1402893-997658_20100614_screen002.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3507/1402893-997658_20100614_screen002.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Ramming into roadblocks is bad for your health.</figcaption></figure>     There are three online events to choose from. Race is the least exciting of the bunch because it's just a basic race. Hot Pursuit allows up to eight players to break into two teams and battle it out across the game's courses. It smoothly moves from one event to the next and, if you're playing public games, it'll auto-balance the teams and swap you between the two factions automatically. The Interceptor mode is also available online, and it's a two-player, one-on-one mode. It doesn't seem like too many people are playing Interceptor online, as it can be hard to get a game going. It's interesting, but Hot Pursuit is where it's at. That you earn bounty and can upgrade your weaponry by playing online only helps to make the online mode more addicting and exciting, since you're unlocking additional cars every few races.<br/> <br/> Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit feels like it's almost always locked at 30 frames per second. While that's not 60, it's smooth enough to convey a real sense of speed. When you've unlocked the fifth tier of cars and start barreling through these courses at like 250 miles per hour, it feels insane. Also, the game has really terrific weather effects. The rain and the wet roads look fantastic, and thunderstorms that light up the nighttime tracks are frequent and really, really cool. Beyond that, the car models look good and crunch up pretty well after a crash... well, pretty well for licensed cars, anyway. Considering how hard some of these hits can be at top speed, it'd be nice to see more realistic damage. The racing in Hot Pursuit also sounds great, with throaty exhausts and some pretty good cop talk over the radios to spice things up.<br/> <br/> Though I occasionally felt like I was fighting the front-end UI to get it to tell me which events I should be trying next, the gameplay offers just enough variety to work well in short bursts and the online modes are terrific fun that could keep you coming back for a while as you strive to gain levels and get a better, longer spike strip.", "deck": "Hot Pursuit has some of the best online play that the Need For Speed series has ever seen.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-346/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31698/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/3030-31698/", "id": 31698, "name": "Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-11-19 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101657/", "id": 101657, "name": "Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/pac-man-championship-edition-dx-review/1900-347/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/1635057-pacman_ce_dx_release.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1635057\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56288659793814\" data-width=\"970\" style=\"width: 970px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/1635057-pacman_ce_dx_release.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1635057\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12337/1635057-pacman_ce_dx_release.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The ghosts have numbers, but YOU ARE THE PAC-MAN.</figcaption></figure>     Taking clear inspiration from <a data-ref-id=\"3025-237\" href=\"/geometry-wars/3025-237/\" slug=\"geometry-wars\">             Geometry Wars</a> pretty much across the board--from the thumping techno and pulsing neon lights to the perpetual sense of escalation and pure speed--2007's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19552\" href=\"/pac-man-championship-edition/3030-19552/\" slug=\"pac-man-championship-edition\">            Pac-Man Championship Edition</a> made <a data-ref-id=\"3010-382\" href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/\" slug=\"namco-bandai-games-inc\">           Namco</a>’s old <a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/27/1637314-pac_man_pie_chart.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">          pie-chart</a> feel more vital than it had, arguably in decades. As unlikely as the success of Pac-Man CE was, we're talking straight-up Powerball odds that the follow-up, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32607\" href=\"/pac-man-championship-edition-dx/3030-32607/\" slug=\"pac-man-championship-edition-dx\">         Pac-Man Championship Edition DX</a>, would be able to match it, let alone exceed it. But not only does DX make CE feel like weak tea, it all but makes that game obsolete. This is sensory overload of the highest order, the kind of game that leaves your eyeballs dry, your nerves shot, and every last bit of you wanting more. Pac-Man Fever has been effectively weaponized. <br/> <br/>As Championship Edition was a modern evolution of the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\" href=\"/pac-man/3030-7624/\" slug=\"pac-man\">        Pac-Man</a>, DX expands specifically on the work done by CE, creating an experience that’s anchored by a lot of the classic Pac-Man sights and sounds and the fundamental gameplay concepts, but whose resemblance to the old quarter-chomper is rapidly slipping away. Like Pac-Man, you are constantly nagivating a series of mazes, eating up dots and using <a data-ref-id=\"3055-685\" href=\"/power-pellet/3055-685/\" slug=\"power-pellet\">       Power Pellets</a> to turn the tables on the marauding <a data-ref-id=\"3015-758\" href=\"/ghosts/3015-758/\" slug=\"ghosts\">      ghosts</a>. Like Pac-Man Championship Edition, the widescreen mazes are split into left and right sides, with different maze patterns appearing on one side as you clear out all of the dots and Power Pellets on the other, giving the whole game a relentless sense of momentum, and putting more of a focus on high scores than simple survival. In addition to loading the game up with a well-considered number of visual styles that recall or reimagine past incarnations of the Pac-Man, as well as a good fistful of new mazes that feature varying balances of straightaways and tight corners, DX introduces three key gameplay concepts, the total sum of which is an experience that feels fresh precisely because it still feels so familiar. <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1620956-30785cedx_screenshot02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1620956\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1620956-30785cedx_screenshot02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1620956\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1620956-30785cedx_screenshot02.jpg\"></a><figcaption> These ghosts are about to get it.</figcaption></figure>     First and foremost are the green, static, \"sleeping\" ghosts that litter the mazes. Once you pass by these sleeper ghosts, they begin intently chasing you, showing none of the patterned behavior found in the regular ghosts. As you work your way back and forth across the changing maze, you can build up a pretty significant ghost train behind you, regularly numbering in the dozens. Once a rare Power Pellet appears, I have to tell you, the sensation you get when you about-face and just start plowing through these ghosts, with the recognizable arcade sound cue registering faster and higher as your combo points multiply... it’s one of the most purely enjoyable feelings I’ve gotten from a game in a long, long time. Considering how much time I’ve spent being stressed out and terrorized by those awful specters over the years, there’s something downright therapeutic about it. In their original arcade incarnation, the ghosts in Pac-Man were terrifying. The four of them hunted you for sport, with the scattered Power Pellets providing only brief reprieves from their malevolence. Championship Edition definitely strengthened Pac-Man’s position against them, but in DX they’re cheap fodder for the mighty Pac-God. <br/> <br/>As your score rises, so does the speed of the game, which is where the other two DX additions come into play. While the maze layouts are decidedly circuitous, the dot patterns are laid out into very deliberate paths, and high scores almost always hinge on how closely you can keep to that track. The increased speed, plus the rogue ghosts that still patrol the maze, as well as the increasing danger of running into your own ghost train as it grows longer and longer, all conspire to throw you off. It’s manageable up to a certain point, but the speed eventually just makes it overwhelming. When you’re close to having an unfortunate encounter with a ghost, the game will effectively go into <a data-ref-id=\"3015-78\" href=\"/bullet-time/3015-78/\" slug=\"bullet-time\">     bullet-time</a> and zoom in on your position, giving you time to choose an alternate path, or elect to trigger a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-97\" href=\"/bomb/3055-97/\" slug=\"bomb\">    bomb</a>, which momentarily bumps all of the active ghosts on the maze back into their central holding pen and lowers the game speed slightly, giving you time and room to breathe. <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1620957-30786cedx_screenshot03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1620957\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1620957-30786cedx_screenshot03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1620957\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1620957-30786cedx_screenshot03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1620957-30786cedx_screenshot03.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> HNNNG</figcaption></figure>     One of the net effects of the bombs, the slow-down, and the sheer volume of ghosts is that the challenge lies not in survival, but in besting the scores of your friends and climbing your way up the leaderboards. Though it won’t point out when friends beat specific scores, DX is more than happy to let you know where you stand in the global rankings in the maze-specific five- and ten-minute score attack modes, as well as the time trial and ghost combo modes, both of which go and put their own unique spin on the DX gameplay. There's a weird misstep with the leaderboards, in that your own score doesn’t show up integrated into your friends leaderboard. It’s easy enough to flip back and forth between your score and your friends leaderboard and figure out where you fit, but still, a goofy choice. <br/> <br/>The only thing I really wish Pac-Man Championship Edition DX had was just <i>more.</i> More mazes, more modes, more ways for me to subjugate ghosts and rub my high scores in my friends’ stupid, stupid faces. It’s not that this package feels particularly anemic, it’s just that what’s here is so damn good, I wish it didn’t have to end.", "deck": "This is the fastest, loudest, most overwhelming, most viscerally pleasurable Pac-Man experience available on the market today without a prescription.

When an outside shot that shouldn't have any chance of falling passes through the hoop, I curse. When a player is knocked down as a pass is headed his way, I curse. When goaltending is called, I curse. It might say \"Rated E\" on the package, but by the time I'm done, NBA Jam is probably closer to AO... unless I'm winning, of course. This has remained constant since the early 1990s, when Jam was first released, and it's also a clear indicator that EA's take on NBA Jam faithfully captures the spirit of the original game and its sequels, making for an awesome multiplayer game.<br/> <br/> NBA Jam, in case you don't already know, is a fast-paced, over-the-top, two-on-two basketball game that emphasizes your ability to run directly at the basket and hit the shoot button, which usually causes you to perform one of several crazy slam dunks. This time out, the defensive side of the game feels way more savage. Classic tactics like shoving the guy who doesn't have the ball to the ground just as a pass is heading his way still work, but it's also significantly easier to block jumpers, to the point where it's almost not worth trying them unless you can catch the defenders way out of position. In fact, blocking slam dunks seems easier than it's been in the past, too, which puts a greater emphasis on alley-oops, since those seem to come in higher and harder than the average slam dunk. This makes the game all about your ability to change up your timing and not rely on the same trick again and again, since it's easy to stuff any particular type of offense if you're looking for it. While it's all still governed by mysterious shot percentages--which invariably lead to you yelling at your TV when a three-pointer doesn't go down like you think it should--it feels like a pretty balanced system overall.<br/> <br/> With that foundation in place, NBA Jam becomes an incredible multiplayer experience that has the easy-to-understand feel of a basic party game, but offers enough nuance to reward players that take the time to figure out what's going on beneath the surface. If you've been a fan of games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16928\" href=\"/nba-jam/3030-16928/\" slug=\"nba-jam\">NBA Jam</a> (the original), <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10512\" href=\"/nba-hangtime/3030-10512/\" slug=\"nba-hangtime\">NBA Hangtime</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4632\" href=\"/nba-showtime-nba-on-nbc/3030-4632/\" slug=\"nba-showtime-nba-on-nbc\">NBA Showtime</a>, this probably doesn't shock you too much. The classic formula that's swallowed quarters for years is still completely intact and crazy exciting. But at some point, the question about whether or not you should pick up NBA Jam becomes a value proposition. That's why the game tries to flesh out its basic arcade style with a variety of single-player modes that alter some of the peripheral elements of the action while keeping the same basic core.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1405257-040.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405257\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.61614583333333\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1405257-040.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405257\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1405257-040.jpg\"></a><figcaption>I think, by law, I'm required to write BOOMSHAKALAKA in one of these captions. </figcaption></figure>     Game types like \"Smash\" focus on breaking the backboard by giving each hoop a health meter that drops more if you land rim-rocking alley oops than if you go for layups or regular jump shots. There's also a remix mode that adds power-up icons to the court, temporarily pumping up players with better offense, speed, and so on. The more dramatic departures from the standard gameplay actually cut the game down to a half-court and switch the perspective, putting the hoop at the top of your screen, rather than the sides. Here, you'll play first-to-21 games or domination, which is a zone control mode that lets you take control of spots on the court by shooting baskets from those spots. Despite the changed perspective, the same controls and basic ideas still apply, though I found it a lot harder to line up shoves and blocks from the new angle.<br/> <br/> These different types of games are combined into the remix tour, which clusters the teams together by division and gives you three challenges per team, each of which is one of the aforementioned game types or a boss battle, which pits you against a powered-up NBA player in a one-on-one confrontation. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6543\" href=\"/magic-johnson/3005-6543/\" slug=\"magic-johnson\">Magic Johnson</a>, for example, can teleport around the court, allowing him to alley oop to himself. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7085\" href=\"/karl-malone/3005-7085/\" slug=\"karl-malone\">Karl Malone</a>'s shoves send you flying across the entire court. The boss battles are pretty interesting and each one requires you to figure out a specific weakness for each player and exploit it. And beating those players unlocks them for regular (meaning they don't have their crazy powers) use in normal games. Along with those unlocks, the game has a big in-game achievement system that lets you unlock, for example, Dennis Rodman, provided you can get 10 rebounds in a single game. Beating the remix tour gives you access to the Beastie Boys, who previously appeared in home versions of NBA Jam, but not the arcade games.<br/> <br/> The way the remix tour pacakges up the various modes is fine, but it doesn't prevent NBA Jam from being a game best played in short bursts by more than one player. On the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, you can attempt to find players for online games, but the competition seems a little thin, and I've had trouble finding games. As such, you're probably better off playing with friends. The other difference between platforms is graphical, though it's a fairly standard deviation between the platforms. The PS3 and 360 versions have a crisp, clean look that really makes the player expressions and unique, almost marionette-like characters and animation pop out. The Wii version, running in a lower resolution and all, looks a little grungy when compared to the other versions, but that doesn't mean that it looks bad on its own merits. The art style is the \"thing\" about NBA Jam's visuals, and it works perfectly across all platforms. There are also Wii Remote control options in the Wii version, which lets you slam down the Wii Remote to drive dunks through. It's not the most precise thing in the world, but it's still pretty satisfying.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1405253-019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405253\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.61614583333333\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1405253-019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405253\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1405253-019.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1405253-019.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dunks, dunks, and more dunks. </figcaption></figure>     The audio also recaptures that classic sound, with longtime Midway sports announcer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-50068\" href=\"/tim-kitzrow/3040-50068/\" slug=\"tim-kitzrow\">Tim Kitzrow</a> returning to do all the announcing. That means your \"boomshakalakas\" are totally authentic. However, there's more repetition out of the announcing than you'd like, and the game often goes too far for a joke, making the game a lot more chatty than it was back in the day. Also, the commentary throws in lines like \"no hoop for you\" and other pop-culture-type stuff that feels a little too SportsCenter-y. Still, I suppose it's a step up from just hearing the guy yell \"<a data-ref-id=\"3005-7018\" href=\"/scottie-pippen/3005-7018/\" slug=\"scottie-pippen\">Pippen</a>!\" over and over again.<br/> <br/> NBA Jam has always been a game that lives and dies by its core gameplay and your desire to play that game at length, and that part hasn't changed in 2010.

Problem is, PowerGig has the misfortune of going up against <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27919\" href=\"/rock-band-3/3030-27919/\" slug=\"rock-band-3\">Rock Band 3</a>--an already established and recognizable franchise--which effectively did the same thing, and did it way, way better. Actually, even if the competition weren't so fierce, PowerGig is a substandard product across the board. The story mode, the song selection, the presentation, the number of players it supports--everything about PowerGig feels awkward and listlessly realized, as though the developer was unaware that there were already two, fiercely competitive franchises chasing after the same customers.<br/> <br/>As it's one of the defining characteristics of PowerGig, let's talk about that guitar. The underlying notion that using an actual instrument can make the mock-and-roll experience feel more real seems sturdy enough, but PowerGig fails utterly to make good on this promise. Disregarding the three-quarters size and the chintzy plastic body for a moment, this is an actual, functional electric guitar. It feels cheap and it's a difficult instrument to keep in tune, but these facts aren't really material to this review, or the game. What is material, though, is that playing PowerGig with this guitar is uncomfortable as <i>hell</i>, and the game itself never really capitalizes on the fact that you've got a real guitar in your hands to justify that discomfort. <br/> <br/></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396263\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56242424242424\" data-width=\"3300\" style=\"width: 3300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396263\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption> AND</figcaption></figure>     By default, PowerGig is a five-button guitar game, not unlike what you'd expect from Rock Band or Guitar Hero, though it uses its own style of notation that's difficult enough to read that it kind of explains why <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a> would be willing to pay <a data-ref-id=\"3010-648\" href=\"/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/\" slug=\"harmonix-music-systems-inc\">Harmonix</a> the licensing fee to use that familiar note highway. There is also a power chord mode, which expands on the complexity a bit by recognizing the individual strings and asking you to make some simple two-finger power chords. Even in this power chord mode, though, you're still limited to the five frets you use for standard play, and the game makes no pretense about any of this being useful for actually learning how to play guitar. I feel like this should be implicitly obvious, but in case it's not, you <i>cannot</i> use the PowerGig guitar to access the pro mode functionality in Rock Band 3, not that that's a reasonable expectation.<br/> <br/> You can choose to play PowerGig with a standard Rock Band or Guitar Hero compatible controller, which is certainly a more comfortable, if less <i>authentic</i>, experience. Even with a better controller, there's still the unique quirk of not being able to use those controllers' built-in tilt functionality to trigger PowerGig's version of star power or overdrive, instead requiring you to press the select button. As a baffling counterpoint that flies in the face of the authenticity that PowerGig's six-stringed controller seems to strive for, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7010\" href=\"/seven45-studios/3010-7010/\" slug=\"seven45-studios\">Seven45 Studios</a> has produced its own AirStrike drum kit that uses special drum sticks, and, I dunno, lasers I guess, to interpret your Metallica Drummer routine into actual gameplay. I won't even get into the fact that the bounce-back from striking <i>something</i> is an integral part of the real drumming experience, because the rarity of the AirStrike drums means that I've never actually handled a set myself. As far as I can tell this hardware is being made available almost exclusively through the developer's website. Smartly, PowerGig supports the drum controller you probably already have in your home.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396264\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396264\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> ROLL!!!</figcaption></figure>     In addition to guitar and drum controllers, PowerGig has microphone support. But in another move that can only be characterized as deliberately befuddling, there's no discrete bass guitar part, limiting your band play to a three-piece. Before you can get to the sub-par plastic band action, though, you must first suffer PowerGig's weirdo fantasy story mode, which is corny and self-serious in equal measures, and spends way, way too much time exhaustively explaining the tribal power structure in this stupid, rock-inspired universe. Without a library of downloadable content to rely on, PowerGig really lives or dies by its on-disc track listing, which is 100 percent leftovers. There are some recognizable artists in the mix, including folks like Eric Clapton and Dave Matthews who have up to now been staunchly opposed to the whole plastic-band idea. I suppose it's only fitting that these luddites would end up hitching their wagons to this lame horse. But even when it's bands you've heard of, chances are the songs themselves aren't the ones you'd want. <br/> <br/>After some serious consideration, I cannot come up with a single good reason why someone would buy PowerGig: Rise of the SixString.

At its core, the game was a fairly forgettable beat-'em-up with a few interesting monsters to bludgeon and eviscerate, but the sheer amount of blood and gore on offer (again, relative to other games of this era) made it an enticement, even in its heavily edited TurboGrafx form. Basically, it was all guts, no substance.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1471170-splatterhouse_2010_08_18_10_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471170\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4096\" style=\"width: 4096px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1471170-splatterhouse_2010_08_18_10_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471170\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1471170-splatterhouse_2010_08_18_10_13.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Don't let the jorts fool you: Rick is as brutal as they come.</figcaption></figure>     And yet, here we are with a modern-day take on the franchise. Arguably the most interesting thing about this remake--apart from its protracted development history, which makes for interesting reading elsewhere--is that the reverse is largely true here. The modern day <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22968\" href=\"/splatterhouse/3030-22968/\" slug=\"splatterhouse\">      Splatterhouse</a> for the Xbox 360 and PS3 is a game that manages to construct a more interesting gameplay experience around piles upon piles of largely forgettable gore. This is still a fairly standard beat-'em-up, but there are enough wrinkles, tweaks, and amusements here to keep a player functionally engaged through the entirety of its story. Simultaneously, no matter how much blood, viscera and spinal fluid the developers see fit to dump on you, it's exceedingly difficult to muster up more than a casual shrug at the sight of it all.<br/><br/>The set-up for all this \"house splattering\" is a pretty typical boy loves girl, boy and girl visit creepy mansion of lunatic doctor, lunatic doctor kidnaps girl and leaves boy for dead, boy finds ancient Aztec ceremonial death mask and uses it to become a hulking, jorts-wearing juggernaut of death kind of deal. The talking death mask transforms Rick, the aformentioned boy, into said juggernaut for entirely self-serving purposes. That said, Rick has little choice but to work with this demonic mask, since he would ideally like to save his comely young girlfriend before the doctor turns her into a sacrificial vessel and unleashes some creatures that exist halfway between Hell and Earth.<br/><br/>Halfway Between Hell and Earth would make a pretty good heavy metal album title, as would much of the stuff found in this game, really. Splatterhouse is basically the video game equivalent of a gigantic ASCII devil horns, a metal and gore geek's fantasy of grotesque violence by way of screeching guitar solos. As you run through this game, alternating between the weak and strong attack buttons to form accidental combos and periodically picking up boards, machetes, chainsaws, and even the occasional weaponized severed limb to ramp up the damage, licensed tracks from the likes of Mastodon, Five Finger Death Punch, and Goatwhore will often begin blaring in the background.<br/><br/>All the while, the spirit ensconced within the mask goads and curses at Rick to do better, makes fourth-wall breaking cracks about M-ratings and the nature of what makes a Splatterhouse, and occasionally takes the well-deserved opportunity to call him a pussy. This kind of dialogue could have been deathly with the wrong combination of writing and voice acting, but here it's generally chuckle-worthy, thanks in no small part to the delivery by veteran voice performer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-3244\" href=\"/james-jonah-jim-cummings/3040-3244/\" slug=\"james-jonah-jim-cummings\">     Jim Cummings</a>. It's just a shame the rest of the game's voicework is pretty boilerplate, and that the game frequently suffers from audio mixing bugs, where dialogue gets drowned out by metal guitars or otherwise chops up into glitchy nonsense.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1499584-4482221134_993260ed08_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1499584\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19306/1499584-4482221134_993260ed08_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1499584\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19306/1499584-4482221134_993260ed08_b.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You could paint the Great Wall of China a lovely shade of red with all the blood in this game.</figcaption></figure>         I haven't harped terribly much on the mechanics of Splatterhouse because, quite frankly, I have a hard time remembering very many of them. At some point the specifics of the beat-'em-up gameplay all blend together into one big, gooey, red paste. Learning the game's basic combos and attacks is most certainly important, as is earning blood, which is your primary purchasing method for additional combos and special attacks. Odds are most players will never get to a point where they memorize all these attacks, since you rarely need the most complex ones outside of the game's hardest difficulty setting--which is a real bastard, by the way. More often, though, you can satisfactorily blow through each room full of zombie men, animal-esque mutants, and various other grotesqueries by button mashing to your heart's content.<br/><br/>Fortunately, that serves the game just fine. The combat is largely satisfying, if not overly exciting. There are some nifty kill moves you can pull on weakened enemies. These launch you into quicktime events and play out like low-rent versions of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-7\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3025-7/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a> fatalities. The main problem is that there just aren't enough of them. You've seen all the ways to kill one enemy type by the first or second time they appear, so repetition does tend to set in rather quickly. Still, it's a beat-'em-up, and repetition is kind of the thing with these games. If you aren't willing to put up with a little of it, even in light of how brutal and decently entertaining the combat can be, then this is definitely not the game for you.<br/><br/>Where Splatterhouse falters is in the areas where it tries to veer outside of the standard beat-'em-up trappings. As a throwback to classic Splatterhouse--which, by the way, you can unlock a playable and well-emulated version of in the game (uncensored), along with Splatterhouses <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2793\" href=\"/splatterhouse-2/3030-2793/\" slug=\"splatterhouse-2\">   2</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-534\" href=\"/splatterhouse-3/3030-534/\" slug=\"splatterhouse-3\">  3</a>--the game will periodically morph into a sidescroller, letting you knock enemies silly from a different perspective, while also avoiding pitfalls and traps via copious amounts of jumping and ducking. In theory, these are a nice little nod to the classic games, but the controls for the jumping and dodging sections aren't quite responsive enough to avoid becoming a frustration. It's even worse in the non-sidescrolling platforming bits, where you're hopping from highlighted jump point to highlighted jump point. The timing is just janky, and for all the tough battles I ended up fighting through over the course of the game, the trifling little jumping bits proved to be infinitely more vexing, simply because the controls lack the necessary tightness. There aren't a million of these sections, thankfully, but there are enough to be a royal pain the ass, especially due to the atrociously long load times that plague both versions of the game. How do you make a game where you can die instantly, and force someone to sit for 30-to-45 seconds just to load up the last checkpoint?<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1551382-30770005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1551382\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4096\" style=\"width: 4096px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1551382-30770005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1551382\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1551382-30770005.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1551382-30770005.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Splatterhouse's monsters alternate between decent throwbacks to the games of old, and generic creature crap.</figcaption></figure>     The game's visuals are a bit of a disappointment. I am a self-professed gore junkie, but much of what Splatterhouse passes off as gore feels rather bland and superfluous. Interesting kills--and, to that point, interesting enemies to kill--are largely overshadowed by your ability to simply paint the walls with ungodly amounts of fakey-looking blood. This goop has the consistency of a bad spaghetti sauce, and while it's amusing for a bit to see Rick completely drenched in the junk, after a while I think the red detectors in my eyes started to fritz out, because I just stopped noticing or caring. There just isn't enough variety in the ways to kill, or in the designs of the enemies you're fighting, to really give all this violence the visceral impact you'd want. At least the basic visual style of the game, with its faux-cel-shaded design and frequently brutal environmental aesthetics, is nice enough to look at. Now if only the frame rate could stay halfway consistent...<br/><br/>Above all else, Splatterhouse is a game that screams \"competent.\" Specifically, it screams it with a guttural heavy metal growl over the deafening din of grinding power chords and machine gun blasts of double bass, while simultaneously vomiting a fire hydrant's worth of blood all over the screen. That all that gratuitous violence and gushing gore manages to inspire so little reaction is perhaps more a testament to where we as a society sit now compared to the late '80s. More to the point, it speaks to the notion that a bunch of bleeding freaks and severed torsos maybe isn't quite enough to sell a game all by its lonesome anymore. It's good, then, that Splatterhouse has a bit more going on upstairs than the games it originally spawned from. This isn't a game you're likely to remember for too terribly long past its conclusion, but if you're a die-hard nostalgist for this franchise, or just someone looking for a decent outlet to punch, stab, and batter the living hell out of some crap for 10 or so hours, Splatterhouse will scratch that itch.", "deck": "The splatter is most certainly on display in this functional, yet indistinct beat-'em-up.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-350/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22968/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/splatterhouse/3030-22968/", "id": 22968, "name": "Splatterhouse"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-11-28 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83539/", "id": 83539, "name": "Splatterhouse"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tron-evolution-review/1900-351/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1555445-14773multiplayer_22.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1555445\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.65246853823814\" data-width=\"1033\" style=\"width: 1033px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1555445-14773multiplayer_22.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1555445\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/95284/1555445-14773multiplayer_22.png\"></a><figcaption> The multiplayer lets dudes on foot and dudes on bikes fight.</figcaption></figure>     While I loved <i>Tron</i> when it was originally released back in 1982, I was also six years old. When I look back at the movie with a more discerning eye, it doesn't hold up especially well. But the visual style and the basic setting of <i>Tron</i>--a man getting sucked into a computer world where he has to play video games for real--is still something that works today. With that in mind, it seems like we would have reached this point years ago, but here in 2010, the planets have finally aligned. That plodding-but-beloved 1982 sci-fi flick is finally getting a sequel in the form of <i>Tron: Legacy</i>. Meanwhile, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29284\" href=\"/tron-evolution/3030-29284/\" slug=\"tron-evolution\">Tron: Evolution</a> (the video game) serves as a bridge between the two, giving you just enough of the cool old stuff to get interested while setting the stage and letting you know who the primary players will probably be in the upcoming film. The gameplay flounders in spots, but a few interesting set pieces and an informative story make this bridge at least somewhat successful.<br/> <br/> The basic story of Tron: Evolution comes down to control over the system at large. A new type of self-evolving program has appeared, leading to racial tensions between the existing \"basics\" and these new \"ISOs.\" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17245\" href=\"/kevin-flynn/3005-17245/\" slug=\"kevin-flynn\">Kevin Flynn</a>, who is now revered by the programs as the creator of the grid, routinely checks into the ol' computer world to see how things are going. But when a virus known as Abraxas strikes, Flynn and Tron are presumed dead, and one of Flynn's creations--<a data-ref-id=\"3005-17127\" href=\"/clu/3005-17127/\" slug=\"clu\">Clu</a>, otherwise known as the \"young <a data-ref-id=\"3040-99190\" href=\"/jeff-bridges/3040-99190/\" slug=\"jeff-bridges\">Jeff Bridges</a>\" seen in the trailers for the upcoming film, attempts to seize control of the entire system. You play as a silent protagonist named Anon, a security monitor program that is another of Flynn's creations, and it's your job to stop the spread of the virus and, hopefully, stop Clu.<br/> <br/> While the story can sound a little complicated and way crazy when you spell it out like that, seeing the early-game events unfold is really interesting if you've been at all interested in the upcoming film, which opens with Flynn being missing for 20 years. The game shows you where he went and why he wasn't around to raise his son. It also sets up the motivations for characters like Clu and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15523\" href=\"/quorra/3005-15523/\" slug=\"quorra\">Quorra</a> while also giving you a sense of how the grid has changed since the first film. Chalk it up to advancing technology if you like, but the world of Tron isn't quite so neon-filled this time around. While it still has a big blue and futuristic tinge to it, you'll also travel outside the supposedly-safe havens of Tron City and see vast wastelands, where power is hard to come by. Like the original film, the game uses colors to signify things like control and influence, like the bright orange corruption that lets you know that Abraxas is at work in your current location.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1555448-14776multiplayer3b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1555448\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.53117600631413\" data-width=\"1267\" style=\"width: 1267px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95284/1555448-14776multiplayer3b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1555448\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/95284/1555448-14776multiplayer3b.jpg\"></a><figcaption>As you gain levels, you'll get access to abilities that really change the game. </figcaption></figure>     Actually playing Tron: Evolution is where things get a little less exciting. For the most part, you'll switch between sections where you need to run along walls or climb around and sections where you'll fight groups of enemies before you're allowed to proceed. The traversal sequences are usually pretty straightforward, but sometimes the camera doesn't play along, leading to a few cases where you're not sure where you're supposed to be jumping next. To mitigate some of that, most of the walls and ledges you'll need to run on or hop to have icons on them. This reduces the need to explore the world, though there are collectibles stashed here and there for players who do decide to look behind every pillar and climb every surface. The critical path through these sequences is never too difficult and rarely requires you to do more than hold down the right trigger and make sure you're jumping off of the walls at the right time.<br/> <br/> That wall-running and climbing also factors into the combat a bit, since you'll restore your energy and health by running over lit-up wall strips or vaulting off of energy nodes. But breaking away from the enemies that are lighting you up with disc tosses that home in on you can be a bit of a pain, making extremely defensive play the best way to stay alive when you're being attacked by wave after wave of glowing dudes. When you're blocking, any normal attack will bounce right off, giving you an opportunity to execute a more-damaging counterattack off of that block. You've got basic three-hit combos with disc tosses or melee, and you'll also acquire harder-hitting secondary attacks as you gain experience. This starts with the Heavy Disc, which is is a basic heavy attack. But you can eventually swap that for the Bomb Disc, which explodes, the Stasis Disc, which slows down enemies when they're hit, or the Corruption Disc, which siphons health from your targets. Certain enemies are weak to specific discs, so you'll have to switch them out on the fly as you face different types of foes. Those weaknesses are only shown to you when you first encounter a new type of bad guy, and since they all look pretty similar, I found it a little tough to keep track of all those weaknesses.<br/> <br/> The combat can get extremely frustrating in spots, but it becomes easier as you get deeper into the game because you're constantly gaining experience points and getting points (megabytes, actually) that you can use to beef up your character. The standard add-ons of bigger health bars and more energy reserves are there, but the most game-changing ability I discovered is an auxiliary power that, once purchased, allows you to effectively turn invisible whenever you stand still. So in the middle of a fight, you can select Stasis and stop your enemies in their tracks. This lets you slowly crawl over to health or sneak up behind people to set them up for a charged-up melee attack. It makes the rest of the game a lot easier, and since your levels and abilities are persistent across multiple plays and multiplayer mode, it might be worth it to sink some time into multiplayer first before going into the campaign, just to start out with a little boost.<br/> <br/> These two primary forms of action are broken up by vehicle sequences. The light tank sequences look sort of neat, as you get to blast apart a ton of recognizers while trying to get from point A to point B, but the tank controls feel clunky. The <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3729\" href=\"/light-cycle/3055-3729/\" slug=\"light-cycle\">light cycle</a> shows up in a few spots, too, and there's a great early moment--the first time you get to drive a light cycle--that's probably the best-looking thing in the entire game. The light cycles also show up in the game's multiplayer mode, but I think I'd rather go back to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20883\" href=\"/tron/3030-20883/\" slug=\"tron\">the original arcade game</a> for light cycle action.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1429872-58_169_day3_stagedemo_tron_evolution_061710_2000_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1429872\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1429872-58_169_day3_stagedemo_tron_evolution_061710_2000_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1429872\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1429872-58_169_day3_stagedemo_tron_evolution_061710_2000_018.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1429872-58_169_day3_stagedemo_tron_evolution_061710_2000_018.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> As Anon, you'll have to run up walls and hop from one platform to the next.</figcaption></figure>     The behind-the-back camera view for the light cycles doesn't give you enough information to successfully ride them around the multiplayer mode's larger levels. Without a good sense of what sort of maze of lines you're leaving in your wake, using them effectively to murder your opponents is extremely tricky. In those maps, though, you're really only using the bikes to get from one control point to another, where you'll need to hop out of the bike (which is pretty cool) and finish the task on-foot. The game also has standard deathmatch and team deathmatch modes, but I was left feeling like the game's core combat doesn't really fit too well in the multiplayer. I ran into too many cases of focusing on defeating one enemy only to get totally jacked from behind by another combatant. The mode's not broken, and it makes use of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a>-like perks, mods, and loadout slots, but aside from the bonus of building up your character in multiplayer to make single-player more varied, the multiplayer feels largely unnecessary.<br/> <br/> While Tron: Evolution is set close to the events of the first film, the visual style appears to be a lot closer to the upcoming film. The ornate circuit designs on the characters from the original Tron have been replaced with fewer glowing paths and suits that look more like armor or computerized trench coats and such. It gives it all a more modern look, for sure. Also, the world has a decent amount of visual variety, taking you from the neon blue city areas to darker wastelands that have more mountain-like appearances. The best-looking parts of the game involve the light cycles, which deliver a good sense of speed with a healthy amount of camera shake. Racing away from recognizers as they bomb out sections of the road underneath you looks pretty intense. All in all, the game's environments look pretty nice, though the canned animations in the combat can get a little repetitive. The cutscenes also look decent, utilizing the likenesses of actors like Jeff Bridges, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-76313\" href=\"/bruce-boxleitner/3040-76313/\" slug=\"bruce-boxleitner\">Bruce Boxleitner</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98153\" href=\"/olivia-wilde/3040-98153/\" slug=\"olivia-wilde\">Olivia Wilde</a>. The latter two of those actors also lend their voices to the project, though Bridges' two characters are voiced by a convincing soundalike. The voice cast, overall, does a fine job with the script, which helps make the story work. The music, some of which is taken from the upcoming film's soundtrack, is pretty good, too.<br/> <br/> Parts of Tron: Evolution come close to breaking out of the standard licensed game mold, but most of those parts have absolutely nothing to do with the gameplay, which is usually pretty average.

The driving is so good that many of the annoyances with the way GT5 is built start to evaporate once you get your hands behind the wheel and start driving. Unfortunately, your patience might very well evaporate too whenever you have to deal with the game's cluttered interface.<br/> <br/> I feel it's important to mention that I played GT5 primarily with a racing wheel. While the game is certainly playable with a controller, you'll begin to hit a wall on more technical courses once the cars get faster. The force feedback and information you're given through the wheel is excellent, and feels unique with each car. When you drive through a tight turn you’ll immediately know whether you’re in a front or rear engine car by the amount of over-steer that sets in as your wheel goes slack. Pavement, gravel, and grass all feel different and help indicate just what you can expect out of your next turn. This natural wheel grip sensation, combined with some zoom and shake effects in the modeled cockpit view as you brake and accelerate, really put Gran Turismo's driving on a pedestal when compared with just about any other racing game on the market.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1646117-gt_cockpit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1646117\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1646117-gt_cockpit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1646117\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/1646117-gt_cockpit.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The premium cockpits are gorgeous, but the weather effects are generally poor.</figcaption></figure>     That visceral realism isn't always consistent in the cars themselves. Although the back of GT5’s box mentions there are over 1000 vehicles available in the game, only 200 of those carry the \"premium\" tag, which means they include a modeled cockpit and extra detail to their exteriors. If you're not someone that likes to race inside the car, that may not be such a big deal--but even among the 800 standard cars, the exterior quality is uneven. The worst-looking of these feel like touched-up ports of cars from the PlayStation 2 era. For me, though, the premium cars were more than enough, and the only real grievance I have with the standard cars is that they make up the majority of your racing rivals in each race.<br/> <br/> Damage modeling is poor, bordering on unnoticeable, and even at higher levels with premium cars, the largest of crashes will only cause minor dings and deformities. At the most, bumpers or hoods will dislodge and hang a bit loose, but for the most part the crashes in Gran Turismo 5 are mundane affairs that feel and sound more like cardboard boxes bouncing into each other. What is noticeable, though, is the cost you’ll have to pay for structural damage that isn't visually persistent on your car between races. Chasis repair on many of the high-powered cars will run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Considering that you can buy a new car for that amount, it often leaves you wondering just what the hell Polyphony Digital was thinking when they decided to add damage into the game at all. While racing purists might not mind, the lack of consistent damage effects in GT5 takes you out of the realism that the cockpit and wheel combo so breathlessly creates.<br/> <br/> This graphical inconsistency doesn't only exist with the cars but also with the tracks and the environment as well. The shadow and weather effects specifically seem extremely garish on top of otherwise clean and well laid-out courses. Shadows both in the car and outside have jaggy, aliased edges, and when combined with pixelated rain or snow effects, it'll make you want to jump out of that in-car view to something less in-your-face. Generally, though, the game looks sharp, and GT5 has some gorgeous night-time country driving that makes you consider your chosen car not for its speed, but for its headlight coverage. It looks especially nice when the game speeds up time so that dusk turns to night over the course of a race, and timed <a data-ref-id=\"3015-712\" href=\"/fireworks/3015-712/\" slug=\"fireworks\">fireworks</a> also add some fun to the nighttime sky. For the most part, the tracks in Gran Turismo 5 are fairly static, though incredibly detailed affairs. Almost all of the courses include unbreakable walls or extremely sturdy pencil fencing that feel like compromises in otherwise realistic locations. <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1646100-gt_gokart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1646100\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1646100-gt_gokart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1646100\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/1646100-gt_gokart.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The kart racing is more fun then you'd think.</figcaption></figure>     What Gran Turismo lacks in flourish it tries to compensate for with variety. You’ve got go-karts, American muscle, Japanese tuners, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1579\" href=\"/world-rally-championship/3025-1579/\" slug=\"world-rally-championship\"> World Rally</a> cars, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-509\" href=\"/nascar/3025-509/\" slug=\"nascar\"> NASCAR</a> and everything in between. Only a Formula One license seems noticeably missing from the roster, but open-wheel cars are still there and become available once you get past level 20. A lot of the licensed racing is grouped into \"special events,\" a section of your dashboard devoted towards training or goal-based racing. Some of these carry intro movies that explain a famous track or location you’re about to race in. For the most part they work well, but there are a couple stinkers. A dead-eyed and poorly animated <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5526\" href=\"/jeff-gordon/3005-5526/\" slug=\"jeff-gordon\">Jeff Gordon</a>, who introduces you to NASCAR, is a prime example. All that variety sometimes makes the game feel like it's been stretched too thin.<br/> <br/> You’ll spend most of your time in A-Spec races, which are split up into various leagues from beginner to expert. You can also earn licenses by completing simple tasks such as bringing your car to a complete stop on time, or more difficult tasks, like completing a race without bumping into rival cars. Luckily most of them are not as necessary as in previous games. You’ll earn trophies in the license events, races, and special events, with gifted rewards available as you complete each full set of challenges. Experience points are also awarded and contribute to your level, which is used as a barrier for new events and cars. Around level 15, though, the leveling component becomes a serious grind. Each level takes a couple hours, and you’ll soon wish you could at least <i>see</i> what events come up later so you could plan your garage accordingly. Dropping half-a-million dollars on your favorite car sounds great, until you realize too late that it won’t be useful for your next dozen events.<br/> <br/> As you move your way into more challenging races, you’ll soon learn that it’s not so much your driving skill that’s being tested as your ability to tune your car properly. You simply won’t be able to win certain cups without fiddling under the hood first. There’s not a whole lot of explanation to the tuning mechanics, and there’s no <a data-ref-id=\"3025-199\" href=\"/forza-motorsport/3025-199/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport\">Forza</a>-style auto-upgrade option to make things easy on yourself. Like most things in GT5, though, you’ll eventually figure it out and learn that under a clunky mess of menus is a flexible system for setting your car up however you want. Most of the upgrades are easy to comprehend--you pay your money and suddenly have a boost in your horsepower--but a lot of them can only be fully utilized if you manually move some dials. Eventually you learn these tuning systems <i>too</i> well, and since the majority of races don't include any sort of horsepower limit, it's very easy to enter races with overpowered cars and make the game a one-man race within the first 30 seconds. I spent most of the game playing this way, as the lackluster, wooden AI always seems to follow a set line without taking much thought for where your car is on the track. Though GT5 can get more challenging later on, most races are a test of personal endurance, not competition.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1646114-gt_wheels.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1646114\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1646114-gt_wheels.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1646114\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/1646114-gt_wheels.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/1646114-gt_wheels.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Soft racing wheels really help you grip the road.</figcaption></figure>     If manual tuning as a necessity to progression scares you, take heart in this: I personally know very little about what goes on under the hood of cars. If anything can be said about the lack of arcade functionality in GT’s career mode, it’s that you’ll eventually become a more informed and better driver because of it. Other sticking points for people coming from an arcade background are the lack of a rewind function and fairly poor driving lines. The absence of a rewind function, which has become a common mechanic in driving games over the last few years, is going to hurt novices most. While the early races are fairly short affairs, you won’t see many single events under eight minutes after level 16 or so. Eight minutes is a long time to keep your concentration up at over 100 MPH. Given that it takes hours to move a single level in the late game, and that you usually only earn XP for placing at the end of the race, things can get frustrating quickly.<br/> <br/> It’s especially unfortunate then that you can’t gain XP in the online races to spice things up a bit. Although I never had any problems finding races through the game’s lobby system, it was almost impossible to figure out what the requirements were for each race I joined. If the host didn’t take the time to create a proper title, it meant I had to join the lobby first, then view a separate menu to get the requirements. From there I usually had a short time to tune one of my cars to qualify or select from one of the suggested arcade cars. Although you can use a limited amount of favorite cars from your garage, you can’t favorite separate load-outs. To be honest, the menu system all throughout GT5 is bad. Exiting out of anything almost always requires a confirmation or extra key-press, and unusually long load times for simple menus can sometimes dampen the fun. <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1646111-gt_menu.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1646111\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1646111-gt_menu.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1646111\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/1646111-gt_menu.jpeg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/1646111-gt_menu.jpeg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The GT dashboard is cluttered and requires a lot of unnecessary prompts.</figcaption></figure>     Included as part of the dashboard is some social networking functionality that allows you to share rides, photos, and Twitter-style short messages with your friends. I don’t know why you’d want a walled message board for yourself just for GT5, but it’s there if you want to shout at people you know who are also playing the game. A gifting feature comes in handy when you need to send cars to another person, since some races require specific cars to complete and often people need to trade between accounts. The photo mode in the game lets you take still shots of any of your cars lined up in various locations that you unlock as you progress. It’s extremely well done and gives you a virtual DSLR to take pictures with where you can adjust ISO and focus manually.<br/> <br/> There’s also an AI-driven B-Spec mode where you give commands to a driver that levels separately from yourself. Essentially you watch a race in movie mode and have the ability to tell the driver when to pace up and down, and when to try to pass another driver. If it sounds boring, that’s because it is. The only positive to the feature is that it’s a great way to earn early credits. Once you have a decent garage you can put your driver in an overpowered car and go have some lunch or something. Even without commands he’ll likely win the race, and you might receive a special car or two for placing in first.<br/> <br/> Gran Turismo 5’s core problem is that the broad scope of all these game modes diminishes the polish of the general product. There's no denying the feel of the actual driving, but everything else that makes up the game feels tedious and half-baked. I certainly wouldn’t recommend it for everyone, but for people who value an authentic driving experience, enjoy a bit of difficulty in their games, and are willing to look past a multitude of minor flaws, GT5 could very well satisfy your driving needs for years.", "deck": "A grind-heavy career mode and inconsistent visuals keep this otherwise fantastic driving simulation from finishing first.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-352/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21790/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/gran-turismo-5/3030-21790/", "id": 21790, "name": "Gran Turismo 5"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-12-02 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-86974/", "id": 86974, "name": "Gran Turismo 5"}, "reviewer": "Dave"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dead-nation-review/1900-353/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10663/1119675-19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1119675\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56207674943567\" data-width=\"443\" style=\"width: 443px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10663/1119675-19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1119675\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10663/1119675-19.jpg\"></a><figcaption> This is atypically bright for Dead Nation.</figcaption></figure>     Despite having a strong feeling that the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-79\" href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" slug=\"zombie\">zombie</a> video game had already been <a data-ref-id=\"2300-1658\" href=\"/left-4-dead-2-video-review/2300-1658/\" slug=\"left-4-dead-2-video-review\">more or less perfected</a> over a year ago, I was ready to jump into and enjoy <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2107\" href=\"/housemarque/3010-2107/\" slug=\"housemarque\">Housemarque</a>'s new dual-joystick PSN zombie shooter <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27866\" href=\"/dead-nation/3030-27866/\" slug=\"dead-nation\">Dead Nation</a>. After all, these are the guys behind <a data-ref-id=\"3030-793\" href=\"/super-stardust-hd/3030-793/\" slug=\"super-stardust-hd\">Super Stardust HD</a>. If anyone knows dual-joystick shooting, it's them, right? But Dead Nation's awkward mechanics and dim visual style feel at odds with the twitchy, fast-paced gameplay inherent to the genre, and the lackluster online mode leaves an awful lot to be desired too.<br/> <br/> The disappointing part is that Dead Nation sounded like it <i>should</i> have been great. Your 15 bucks gets you 10 mildly story-driven levels full of monsters to shoot, and there's a light progression mechanic where your performance earns you gold that you can cash in to upgrade weapons ranging from a shotgun and rocket launcher to a flamethrower, blade-hurler, and electro-zap something or other. You can play those 10 levels by yourself, or with a friend in local or online co-op. Everyone with me so far?<br/> <br/> The core problem is the way the game plays. From the get-go, Dead Nation's shooting felt off to me, and even as I upgraded my gear, it never got more enjoyable as the overly long campaign wore on. The camera is pulled further out from the action than I would have liked, making your targets small and relatively hard to aim at (especially since only the default rifle gets a laser sight). The aiming is a little squirrelly anyway, combining with the small targets to make the game feel less precise than the great dual-joystick shooters of the last few years. And that default rifle is the only gun with unlimited ammo, so you tend to rely on it a lot--but it's a single-shot-single-button-press weapon, so my index finger felt like it was just about ready to fall off by the end of the game.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10663/1119697-deadnation_hero.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1119697\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.48030018761726\" data-width=\"1066\" style=\"width: 1066px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10663/1119697-deadnation_hero.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1119697\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10663/1119697-deadnation_hero.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The story between missions is paper-thin.</figcaption></figure>     Worse, none of the levels are what I would call \"well-lit,\" and some areas are downright pitch black. You've got a flashlight that lets you see what's directly in front of you, but even in the best cases, there are often enemies coming right at you that you can barely see. Hiding the monsters and the scenery from you is a central tenet of the game's design, but dual-joystick shooters are all about brightly colored entities moving in obvious contrast to the background. That contrast is necessary so you can subconsciously track the objects moving around your peripheral vision, because everything is moving too fast for you to stop and scrutinize every entity directly. The action doesn't move any slower in Dead Nation than in other shooters; it's just harder to see.<br/> <br/> If the core shooting was more fun to play, the relative lack of variety in Dead Nation's campaign levels would be easier to cope with. The vast majority of the game is composed of same-looking city streets and generic urban areas, with cars strewn all over the place. Admittedly, the cars have real strategic value since you can shoot them to set off their alarms, which attracts the horde until the car explodes, just like in <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3025-1342/\" slug=\"left-4-dead\">Left 4 Dead</a>.

With a friend onboard you can naturally watch each other's backs, making this a much less frequent occurrence. But you'd be best off playing with that friend on the couch with you. Getting into an online game isn't a problem, but when I played online, there was enough lag even as the host to make the game feel noticeably less responsive than it does offline. Also, when you're playing online, you can't talk to your partner because the game currently has no voice chat. Housemarque promises the feature will be along shortly in an upcoming patch, but for an online action game to ship without voice chat one month shy of 2011 is damn near unforgivable at this point.<br/> <br/> At least Dead Nation looks great. That lighting that impacted the quality of the action for me does look nice and moody, and there are some great physics that send zombie bodies flying right at the camera when you set off a big explosion. But it doesn't matter how slick a game like this looks if the action isn't on point.

While there has been no shortage of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-720\" href=\"/disney/3025-720/\" slug=\"disney\">Disney</a>-branded shovelware over the years, there's a history of well-remembered Mickey Mouse games stretching back to the 8-bit days. While Spector's name hasn't been attached to a game in nigh on a decade, he's a designer known for his vision, and Epic Mickey promised a dark, sophisticated Mickey Mouse story aimed at the adult players who grew up with the likes of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9513\" href=\"/castle-of-illusion-starring-mickey-mouse/3030-9513/\" slug=\"castle-of-illusion-starring-mickey-mouse\">Castle of Illusion</a>. Nevermind these heightened expectations, though: even on its own merits, Epic Mickey is a platformer that feels about a generation behind, though one with just enough flashes of inspiration to keep you constantly aware of its wasted potential. <br/><br/> As someone with an honest appreciation for the design aesthetics, cultural significance, and nostalgic payload of all things <i>Disneyana</i>, I was personally delighted at the premise of Epic Mickey. While there's a whole world of familiar Disney characters to populate a Mickey Mouse adventure with, Epic Mickey, after a somewhat senselessly convoluted start, traps The Mouse in a painted Wasteland filled with generations of forgotten Disney stars and little-known extras. In a way, the metagame of name-that-obscure-reference is the most fun thing to do in Epic Mickey. Sometimes the game just lays it on real thick, such as with an encounter with a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-258\" href=\"/tron/3025-258/\" slug=\"tron\">Tron</a> version of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7861\" href=\"/pete/3005-7861/\" slug=\"pete\">Bad Pete</a> perched atop Space Mountain, which I'll admit I'm not immune to the pandering charms of. It also shows a certain capacity of self-awareness, most notably with the location of Mickeyjunk Mountain, a world comprised entirely of discarded Mickey Mouse merchandise. The delicious irony here, of course, is that Epic Mickey will itself one day become consumer detritus, though the game refrains from going that deep down the rabbit hole.  <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1404965-dem_be32010_ventureland_f9238rt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404965\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1404965-dem_be32010_ventureland_f9238rt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404965\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1404965-dem_be32010_ventureland_f9238rt.jpg\"></a><figcaption>    Mickey's Morality is the name of my new post-twee-pop acoustic hardcore band.</figcaption></figure>     This Wasteland is a shadow version of the bright and familiar Magic Kingdom, even mirroring the basic layout and themed worlds of Disneyland, though its approach to this idea often feels rote in its own way, owing significant inspiration to the muddled palletes and general disdain for 90-degree angles fostered by practitioners of dark whimsy like Tim Burton and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-12964\" href=\"/american-mcgee/3040-12964/\" slug=\"american-mcgee\">American McGee</a>. In another interesting kink, Mickey's position as favored son is held by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12713\" href=\"/oswald-the-lucky-rabbit/3005-12713/\" slug=\"oswald-the-lucky-rabbit\">Oswald the Lucky Rabbit</a> in this shadow realm, which is overrun by horrible inky monsters due specifically to Mickey's own characteristic capriciousness. Mickey is, essentially, the villain at the start of the game, and it's up to the player to redeem Mickey's name.  <br/><br/> Interesting ideas abound in Epic Mickey, but they're all sadly in service of gameplay that just doesn't deserve them. While it has some half-baked open-world and role-playing elements, this is a platform-jumping game first and foremost. Specifically, it feels like the kind of mascot-driven platformer that was legion in the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-43\" href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" slug=\"nintendo-64\">N64</a>/<a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" slug=\"playstation\">PlayStation</a> era, before dual analog sticks were standardized and when most third-person polygonal games struggled valiantly with camera controls. Epic Mickey's unruly camera isn't insurmountable, but having to replay sections due to blind jumps and constant fussing gives you plenty of time to consider just how boilerplate most of the platforming feels, and just how dull vast stretches of this game are. Mickey doesn't just hop--keeping with the game's painterly theme, puzzles and treasure hunts are presented on the regular that require you to employ a magical paintbrush that can shoot either paint or paint thinner. Shoot paint at specific, silhouetted parts of the environment, and they'll fill in and come to life; shoot thinner at the brightly colored spots, and they'll melt away, revealing hidden paths and such. There are a few specific puzzles where you're tasked with starting and stopping mechanized systems with your paintbrush that struck me as kind of clever, but it's mostly too obvious--once you've seen it, you've solved it.  <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1404960-dem_be32010_steamboat_f1948rt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1404960-dem_be32010_steamboat_f1948rt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404960\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1404960-dem_be32010_steamboat_f1948rt.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1404960-dem_be32010_steamboat_f1948rt.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Steamboat Willie is cool the first time around...</figcaption></figure>     Combat also revolves around the paintbrush, and you can choose to either thin enemies out of existence or paint them until they turn against their brethren. This ties into the thin notion of Mickey's morality and its impact on the world, but like a lot of the support elements in Epic Mickey, it doesn't seem fully formed. There are other mechanics tossed around as well, such as TVs that can be deployed to distract enemies and timepieces that can slow things down, but it all feels bolted-on rather than integrated. At a point, it feels like Epic Mickey is deliberately squandering its gifts. Among the most novel bits in Epic Mickey are the 2D sidescrolling sections that are nicely modeled after classic Mickey Mouse theatrical shorts like Steamboat Willie, The Band Concert, and most apropros, Thru the Mirror. Like the rest of the jumping and double-jumping in Epic Mickey, it's not the most sophisticated stuff, but it's got charm. Problem is, these sequences serve as the portals between various worlds, and Epic Mickey is just rife with fetch quests that have you frequently going back and forth between worlds, forcing you to play through these sequences every time--that means coming and going--and it's a choice that strips away the charm like paint thinner.<br/><br/> The real tragedy with Epic Mickey is that every last part of it could, and arguably, should, have been totally amazing, but it so consistently falls short of that potential. The Disney enthusiast in me got a certain charge out of the experience, at least for a while, but as a game, it's pretty far from a masterpiece.    ", "deck": "Epic Mickey's brief moments of cleverness and knowing affection for obscure Disneyana are mired by clunky, perfunctory platforming and a general lack of followthrough.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-354/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27562/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/disney-epic-mickey/3030-27562/", "id": 27562, "name": "Disney Epic Mickey"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2010-12-08 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-90075/", "id": 90075, "name": "Disney Epic Mickey"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/lost-in-shadow-review/1900-355/", "description": "<p style=\"\">We spend a lot of time looking at a game's length as some kind of quantifiable  measurement of value to a product, but in truth, a long game does not  necessarily equal a better game.

This is a game with a novel idea, and one  that, for a while, feels fresh and fascinating. But as hours pass and  the game continues on, that once fresh feeling eventually gives way to  monotony. Its fitful attempts to evolve the experience do little to  break up hours upon hours of merely solid and largely unremarkable  platforming levels that feel like little more than the filler required  to make this a retail, disc-based product, and not a digitally released  title.<br/> <br/>It's a shame, because Lost in Shadow most certainly piques one's  curiosity from the get-go, albeit not through any form of narrative. You  know little going into Lost in Shadow, beyond an opening cutscene that  depicts a brutish executioner slicing a boy's shadow from his body, and  tossing it from the top of an absurdly tall tower. You, the shadow,  awake at the bottom, and with the help of an inexplicable fairy that  wordlessly appears and begins assisting you, your goal is to get to the  top of that tower... and then go back down... and then unexpectedly keep  on going until the game just up and decides to end.<br/> <br/> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1407317-169_lost_in_shadows_e3_trailer_061510_2000_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407317\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1407317-169_lost_in_shadows_e3_trailer_061510_2000_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407317\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1407317-169_lost_in_shadows_e3_trailer_061510_2000_18.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The shadows of the environment are your platforms.</figcaption></figure>     Don't expect much explanation for any of what's happening here. Lost  in Shadow employs a narrative style that makes <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30380\" href=\"/limbo/3030-30380/\" slug=\"limbo\"> Limbo</a> look like a <a data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\" href=\"/hideo-kojima/3040-63395/\" slug=\"hideo-kojima\">     Hideo  Kojima</a> joint. With such a dearth of narrative, the developers seem keen  instead on hooking you with this notion of shadow trickery; and for a  time, it works exceptionally well. You learn quickly that the  foreground, at least in the early goings, is simply a means to an end.  The objects in the real world are only useful to you in the context of  the shadows they cast. Traversal of the world requires these shadows to  be manipulated via adjustments to the scenery and light, which you do by  using the Wii remote to identify and select adjustable sections. When  you start to get a handle on how to manipulate the world and get around,  it's one of those great \"a-ha!\" moments that often turn a game from  merely intriguing to downright brilliant.<br/> <br/>Sadly, that moment passes, and brilliance never comes to fruition.  While the game's method of shadow puppetry intrigues at the outset,  malaise begins to set in after several hours of repetitive gameplay--and  then gets piled on after even more hours of that seemingly endless  repetition. The best platformers find a way to ramp up the difficulty  slowly, methodically, with a key understanding of what the player has  experienced early on, and building upon those experiences. Lost in  Shadow more or less does the same thing again, and again, and again, for  hours on end with only periodic bouts of difficulty peppered in at  random moments. The level designs start out interestingly enough, but  fail to evolve into anything more than a shadowy riff on the same sorts  of platforming gimmicks you've seen done a billion times before. <br/> <br/>The game toys with some variety, offering up shadow corridors, which  twist physics in some interesting ways, and light gates, which turn  your shadow into a glowing, three-dimensional being that can navigate  the foreground for a limited time--but little is done with these  concepts outside of the same repetitive gimmicks over and over again.  True cleverness simply seems to elude Lost in Shadow, and its few  brushes with it come so late in the game that some people will have  likely given up before they get anywhere near these moments.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1452233-screenshot_004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452233\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"864\" style=\"width: 864px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1452233-screenshot_004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1452233\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1452233-screenshot_004.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Light gates let you venture out into the three-dimensional realm for short periods.</figcaption></figure>     There is simply no sense of pace to Lost in Shadow. Most of the game is relatively breezy, with true difficulty only appearing at random intervals. I got stuck on maybe a handful of puzzles  over the course of the game's  storyline. Those moments of perplexity often came out of nowhere, and  were usually followed up by more of the same rote action I'd been  enduring for hours prior. Only bouts of haphazard combat are thrown in  to try and break up the action. Combat, however, is not this game's  strong suit. Your shadow can only attack in short bursts, and there's no  block mechanic to speak of, meaning you're forced to stab-and-run a  whole bunch until something is dead. Not difficult, since the enemies  rarely put up much of a fight, but the clumsy-feeling controls, coupled  with a miserable checkpoint system, lead to a lot irritating, accidental  death, followed up by annoying rehashing of lengthy level sections.<br/> <br/>Before eventually submitting to tedium, Lost in Shadow is an  easy game to like. It shows you a stellar idea (that it sadly proceeds  to squander) and offers up a visual aesthetic that is absolutely  pleasing to look at. The way light and shadow are depicted and played  off one another are great, and while the art style owes a great deal to  <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3531\" href=\"/team-ico/3010-3531/\" slug=\"team-ico\">    Team ICO</a>--like, Hudson should probably just cut those guys a check now  and get it over with--it's a particularly pretty derivation that stands  out among many of the best-looking Wii games. <br/> <br/>As I trudged through hour after hour of Lost in Shadow's adventure, a  singular, pervasive thought cycled through my head: I wished this game  were shorter. Besides the combat, there's nothing particularly awful or  busted-feeling to endure, but the middling nature of the platforming  becomes a tiring slog as the game goes on, and on, and on, refusing to  lean on anything but its novel concept. If the developers had cut things  down to maybe half (or even a quarter) of its current length, and  focused on polishing up the game's best, cleverest levels, Lost in  Shadow might've had a chance of standing out as something legitimately  special.", "deck": "Lost in Shadow is a game that makes a great first impression, but ultimately cannot build on that initial momentum, nor recognize when to quit.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-355/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27698/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/lost-in-shadow/3030-27698/", "id": 27698, "name": "Lost in Shadow"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-01-11 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-97139/", "id": 97139, "name": "Lost in Shadow"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dc-universe-online-review/1900-356/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/40823/1680859-dcarmor7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1680859\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/40823/1680859-dcarmor7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1680859\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40823/1680859-dcarmor7.png\"></a><figcaption>If you hit max level and grind out a lot of rep with the right factions, you'll be able to buy fancy suits.</figcaption></figure>     While I've never been much for the traditional <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1798\" href=\"/superhero/3015-1798/\" slug=\"superhero\">superhero</a>, there's something superficially appealing about the notion of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21110\" href=\"/dc-universe-online/3030-21110/\" slug=\"dc-universe-online\">DC Universe Online</a>. For me, that largely comes from the idea of a more action-oriented game, one that's more about skillful manipulation of a gamepad than waiting for your turn to strike and carefully managing a set of additional abilities. But that's probably the first, and most disappointing thing I noticed when I started playing the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a> version of the game.<br/> <br/> DCUO's combat looks like an action game, but it definitely doesn't feel like one. Actions feel latent--you know, like the sort of latency you'd expect when connecting to an MMO server instead of a four-player action game or something. While you start to earn more powerful melee combos as you gain levels, the mushy, unresponsive feel of the attacks make you quickly mash out the full combo, rather than employing any sort of timing or, God forbid, want to decide mid-combo that you want to hold down a button to go for a different attack. With some attacks having extra effects, like interrupting an enemy that's in the middle of casting, the imprecise nature of your attacks can make combat frustrating. They never seem to work right when it counts. Still, it's usually fine enough for just mashing your way through mobs and soloing instances.<br/> <br/> The quest design has a few very right, well-implemented ideas surrounded by a ton of filler. It starts with quest dialogue, which is usually spoken... except the PS3 version of the game currently has a bug that occasionally interrupts speech, and if you play long enough, the speech (and a lot of the other audio) eventually just sort of stops working. While some of the dialogue surfaces in your chat log, it doesn't always do so, and I've missed a few mission briefings, as a result. Not that this is a game-breaking issue. The game is usually pretty good about telling you where to go and what to do for each quest. The problem there is that 90 percent of the 100+ quests I've completed aren't any more complicated than \"go to this area and kill 10 of these things\" or \"go to this area and collect 25 of these things.\" The only thing that makes some of them stand out is that you're being given quests by real characters like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-47\" href=\"/superman/3005-47/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-66\" href=\"/batman/3005-66/\" slug=\"batman\">Batman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-952\" href=\"/the-joker/3005-952/\" slug=\"the-joker\">The Joker</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6225\" href=\"/lex-luthor/3005-6225/\" slug=\"lex-luthor\">Lex Luthor</a>, who have all been recast as middle managers that pop up in small bubbles to introduce new quests. I feel sorry for those guys, going from big-name superstars to hero-traffic controllers, but then, it's also a little strange that, at the start of the game, you basically hold your own as a lowly first-level hero in a fight against a bunch of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9852\" href=\"/brainiac/3005-9852/\" slug=\"brainiac\">Brainiac</a> robots while alongside Superman or Lex Luthor. Shouldn't those guys be saving your pathetic ass instead of sitting in a room somewhere and directing traffic? In the limited cases where you do fight alongside named DC characters, they don't feel special. They seem like they're incapable of getting the job done by themselves and need to rely on shlubs like me to save the world.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1557070-dc_scr_plyract_batcave_050.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1557070\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1557070-dc_scr_plyract_batcave_050.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1557070\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1557070-dc_scr_plyract_batcave_050.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The combat is more action-oriented than most MMOs, but you'll never mistake it for an actual action game.</figcaption></figure>     Many of the quest lines eventually lead up to an instanced encounter against a named character. So, after beating up a ton of plant creatures and collecting spores and beating up a few more plant creatures, you'll go into a greenhouse, fight through some more plant creatures, and eventually fight <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5726\" href=\"/poison-ivy/3005-5726/\" slug=\"poison-ivy\">Poison Ivy</a>, who's somehow managed to capture <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3822\" href=\"/robin/3005-3822/\" slug=\"robin\">Robin</a>. The instances aren't especially memorable on their own, but when you complete a quest line like this, it ends with a brief, lightly animated clip that's at least well-drawn and serves as a passable payoff for killing all of those plants. These clips are one of the best things about the entire game.<br/> <br/> But the best thing about the entirely of DC Universe Online, from what I've seen, has to be the way it handles character creation and customization. Faced with the issue of having you create a character at the beginning of the game and having that character look identical from start to finish or having your look entirely dictated by the gear you're wearing, ruining any hope of a cohesive design for your hero or villain, the developers have decided to split the difference. Most pieces of gear that you'll find are associated with a specific style, like \"Fourth World\" or \"New Genesis\" or \"Biker.\" Once you've equipped an item with that style, you can swap that part of your look to that style any time you want. So if you collect a full set of Biker gear, but don't want to wear it because the stats for it are are all garbage, you can still go toggle the biker look on as a cosmetic option. You can also lock down any or all of your gear to a specific style, so equipping new back items won't remove your cape or putting on some new head armor won't cover up your sweet <a data-ref-id=\"3025-194\" href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" slug=\"final-fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a>-looking hairdo. While this creates the issue of not being able to tell which characters are bad-asses just by looking at them, it lets you play dress-up more effectively, which is probably the most engaging thing DCUO has to offer. <br/> <br/>You'll find those additional costume parts as items that drop from enemies and as quest rewards, and the menus are at least good at telling you if an item has better stats than what you're currently wearing. In addition to actual gear, you'll also find vendor trash and items that recover health and power. The act of looting is surprisngly easy, also. Orbs that represent loot, XP, quest items, and money pop out of enemies when they die, and a quick tap of L2 and R2 will suck in all the nearby orbs. The game's also very kind about what counts as completing a quest task, avoiding the issue of kill stealing entirely by giving credit to anyone that got into battle near the quest item in question. So if you're fighting the guys that are guarding a quest item and someone else runs in and grabs the item while you're busy, you'll still get credit for it.<br/> <br/>With the way the game's menus are designed, I found myself wishing for full mouse support, as navigating the menus with a gamepad and the occasional keyboard shortcut is clunky. Though the game supports voice chat when you're in groups, a keyboard is practically required if you want to communicate with other players, though even that support feels a little half-finished. Any time you go to chat, the big PlayStation 3 on-screen keyboard pops up on-screen, completely blocking the action. It's pretty lame. Without using keyboard shortcuts to get to the menus faster, you're left tabbing from one menu to the next with the gamepad, then waiting for it to pop up, then clumsily moving from one menu item to the next. It's a poor way to handle the numerous menus and sub-screens that an MMO requires.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1535880-dc_scr_grppose_jokersfunhouse_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535880\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1535880-dc_scr_grppose_jokersfunhouse_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1535880\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1535880-dc_scr_grppose_jokersfunhouse_001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1535880-dc_scr_grppose_jokersfunhouse_001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll get to fight against or alongside some of the DC Universe's biggest names. </figcaption></figure>     Some tooltips for your powers would be nice, too. You can equip up to six powers at any given time, and they're primarily done with the gamepad (though you can use the keyboard to trigger them, too). But considering how interchangeable the powers look and how similar the icons that represent those powers sometimes appear (at least on the ice tree), it's easy to forget what does what, especially when you buy your seventh power and have to start making hard decisions about which ones you want to equip on your hot bar. You can go into a submenu to view the descriptions for each power, but even those descriptions don't necessarily give the information I want. They all just read like vague iterations on the phrase \"it shoots ice at enemies,\" with no real numbers that say how much damage each power does. Instead, they just display a confusing percentage that claims that my attacks with increase by 35 percent until the hit counter resets or something. So, then, I should trigger my 60 percent increase power and then just start wailing away with my regular attacks to keep a combo going, right? After 20 hours or so, I'm still not entirely sure.<br/><br/> In addition to the quest-related instances, you can also jump into specific instances, like alerts, which are instances designed for four-player groups. These whisk you away to spots like <a data-ref-id=\"3035-202\" href=\"/area-51/3035-202/\" slug=\"area-51\">Area 51</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3035-10\" href=\"/the-moon/3035-10/\" slug=\"the-moon\">the Moon</a> and give you a set of quests to complete in a smaller area. These also culminate in boss fights, such as a large, Brainiac-affiliated robot or Ultra-Humanite, a big gorilla that keeps shouting about how his adds need to fix the turrets you keep breaking. These alerts don't seem any better than the quest-line instances, though they, too, end with video clips.<br/> <br/> There are also PVP arena-style instances, like a two-on-two control point battle in the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-106\" href=\"/batcave/3035-106/\" slug=\"batcave\">Batcave</a> or a four-on-four skirmish at <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1236\" href=\"/arkham-asylum/3035-1236/\" slug=\"arkham-asylum\">Arkham Asylum</a>. Playing these sorts of modes with the way this game controls wasn't much fun. Also, the game never seems to want to let you into these instances. You queue up for them from the menus, and then wait... and wait...and wait some more. I found myself waiting over an hour for one instance when signing up alone. Perhaps it's better if you group up ahead of time instead of relying on the game's player matching? The whole system feels a bit broken right now.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1557078-dc_scr_plyract_metu_029.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1557078\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1557078-dc_scr_plyract_metu_029.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1557078\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1557078-dc_scr_plyract_metu_029.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1557078-dc_scr_plyract_metu_029.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The different power trees dictate the roles you can take on in a group, but everyone can effectively play a DPS role. </figcaption></figure>     If that's the case, it certainly wouldn't be the only technical issue currently facing DCUO. There's the aforementioned audio bug, and also the game seems to take its sweet time when it comes to player and enemy positions. Once you get flying (or running or gliding, depending on your character's movement power), dropping into a mission area results in you standing all alone for 15 seconds or so, while the game figures out where you are, what's supposed to be standing near you, and what players are in the area. So you're standing around in an empty parking lot, taking damage from enemies that you can't actually see yet, waiting for it all to slowly fade in so you can start fighting back. Frustrating. Also, player character designs also take a good, long time to appear in some cases. I've spent a lot of time in police stations surrounded by grey, featureless heroes as the game struggles to catch up and stream in everyone's unique look. Lastly, the frame rate can get intolerably slow, to the point where I could start counting them... putting the frame rate at around three or four frames per second in one particularly awful spot. The frame rate issues often come along with dropping into new areas from above or flying high above the city, which is a shame because those would both be pretty cool things to do, otherwise.<br/> <br/> Overall, DCUO feels like a PC game that was hastily thrown onto the PlayStation 3 without properly adapting it to the console. With the PC version offering better graphical performance for a cheaper price, it would be the version I would recommend, if I were willing to recommend it at all. But the game's combat feels limp, the quest design is immediately monotonous, and the whole package manages to make being a superhero or villain feel like the most mundane thing in the world.

With an established Dead Space formula now in place, the only surprise about the game's first sequel is that it's actually better than the original. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25444\" href=\"/dead-space-2/3030-25444/\" slug=\"dead-space-2\"> Dead Space 2</a> expands the scope and intensity of its sci-fi horror action without stifling its tense atmosphere or fiddling too much with its nearly perfect third-person shooting.

At the end of the first game we saw Clarke escape the Ishimura and destroy the sinister artifact responsible for the whole undead mess, but beyond those final events his fate was unclear. This being a sequel, Clarke is of course pitted against another outbreak of those awful <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2472\" href=\"/necromorph/3015-2472/\" slug=\"necromorph\"> necromorphs</a>, but the game's writers laudably avoid taking the lazy way out by merely having Isaac's superiors transfer him to another mining colony that also happens to get overrun by monsters. All in a day's work, right?<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1409818-7_169_dead_space_2_trailer_e3_061610_2000_17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409818\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1409818-7_169_dead_space_2_trailer_e3_061610_2000_17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409818\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1409818-7_169_dead_space_2_trailer_e3_061610_2000_17.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The Sprawl is, well, a pretty sprawling place.</figcaption></figure>     Instead, you start with Isaac waking up in a straightjacket with no idea where he is and no memory of the three years since the Ishimura incident. Also, everyone around him is in the process of being slaughtered. This lack of backstory contributes to a healthy mystique that builds up around this second necromorph outbreak as you fight your way through it, and get closer to the truth of why this awful business is happening again and who's responsible for it. In the first game you didn't hear a peep out of Clarke, but now he's joined the noble ranks of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2803\" href=\"/silent-protagonists-who-talk-in-sequels/3015-2803/\" slug=\"silent-protagonists-who-talk-in-sequels\"> formerly silent protagonists</a> who have gone on to more prominent speaking roles, since his trademark robotic helmet will lower during dramatic scenes so he can plead his case to the scant few survivors nearby. The game takes this opportunity for richer characterization and uses it to plumb the depths of Clarke's tattered psyche, but he comes off as kind of a one-dimensional, square-jawed action hero who's never quite in danger of <i>actually</i> losing it, so I didn't feel especially connected to what the game depicts as a grueling internal conflict. But I did appreciate his interactions with the other characters and the way they fleshed out the game's overall storyline.<br/> <br/> Isaac was silent in the first game largely because the dreadful atmosphere of the Ishimura itself was in a lot of ways the real star of the show. As terrifying as it was, though, the ship was a purely utilitarian mining vessel, and at some point when you've seen one drab industrial corridor, you've seen them all. Dead Space 2 moves the setting to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2624\" href=\"/sprawl/3035-2624/\" slug=\"sprawl\"> Titan Station</a>, a vast colony built right into the mined-out remnants of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-6\" href=\"/saturn/3035-6/\" slug=\"saturn\"> Saturn</a>'s largest moon. In contrast to the Ishimura, this place is a fully functioning city in space, complete with residential apartments, churches, and schools. You'll find yourself fighting through all of those places, which serves the dual purpose of nicely varying the backdrops and also providing the means for some really uncomfortable scripted situations involving the occasional innocent bystander.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1468865-deadspace2_gc1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468865\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1468865-deadspace2_gc1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468865\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1468865-deadspace2_gc1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1468865-deadspace2_gc1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Yuck, somebody call an exterminator.</figcaption></figure>     All that space-horror window dressing is great and everything, but for all I care Dead Space could revolve around prancing unicorns on Gumdrop Mountain as long as it still played the way it does. Ultimately, it's the perfectly tuned third-person run-and-gun shooting action that attracts me to this series, and that gameplay has only gotten better in Dead Space 2. It still revolves around shooting the heads, arms, legs, and tentacles off of every necromorph you see, and the basic controls for doing that are still so well tuned that I can't think of any way to meaningfully improve them. Everything from the acceleration in the over-the-shoulder aiming to the fact that you can sprint backwards makes the game a joy to control. Look, any game that lets you reload even while you're running is A-OK in my book. If there were a university course about third-person shooter design, it would devote an entire unit to the way this game plays.<br/> <br/> There are a few new weapon types (a minelayer, a sniper rifle) alongside the iconic original guns like the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1743\" href=\"/plasma-cutter/3055-1743/\" slug=\"plasma-cutter\"> plasma cutter</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1748\" href=\"/line-gun/3055-1748/\" slug=\"line-gun\"> line gun</a>--and of course there are a few tricky new types of enemies to use them on--but otherwise, the mechanics here feel pretty familiar. You still have peripheral tricks like the stasis weapon that lets you slow down enemies, and the kinetic power that lets you launch objects at them. It didn't occur to me until I threw in the first Dead Space, but everything just moves a bit faster here than in the first game, from the way you move around the environments to even how quickly the clever in-game holographic UI pops up when you grab items. It's a subtle difference but one that improves the overall flow of the action in my opinion.<br/> <br/> (It's worth noting the preceding comments about the controls apply only to the console versions, since I didn't have a chance to try the PC version of Dead Space 2 prior to release. A lot of people had trouble with the feel of the first game's aiming on the PC, for what it's worth.)<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1114/1444404-ds2_e32010_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1444404\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1114/1444404-ds2_e32010_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1444404\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1114/1444404-ds2_e32010_08.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1114/1444404-ds2_e32010_08.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Nothing a good solid boot to the head won't fix.</figcaption></figure>     That minor increase in speed goes hand in hand with the game's slightly greater emphasis on big action. That's not to say there isn't also plenty of quiet suspense, though. You'll creep through plenty of dark corridors, never sure when another necromorph will burst from its carefully hidden monster closet and startle the crap out of you. There are also a number of subdued sequences that take place in a vacuum, where your air supply is limited and there's almost no sound, and in zero gravity, with objects lazily floating all around you. Those zero-G segments might be the most improved thing about the game, since Isaac's suit now has little boosters that let you fly around freely, rather than having to launch yourself in a straight line from surface to surface. The designers use that new freedom to stage one mindboggling, lonely spacewalk outside the station itself that honestly left my jaw hanging open. It's really effective, evocative stuff.<br/> <br/> But the bigger environments and quicker gameplay allow some stunningly larger-than-life action sequences to take place as well. Remember when that giant tentacle came out of nowhere near the beginning of the first game, and you had to actively shoot its weak points as it dragged you through the ship? The sequel has a bunch of stuff like that, amplified by a large factor. There aren't a lot of boss encounters, per se, but you'll certainly have to deal with plenty of giant ugly monsters while in some compromising positions. And while you'll spend lots of time in tight, dark corridors, there are plenty of instances of larger-scale combat against multiple enemies in wider areas, as well. I felt like the designers struck the right balance to keep things varied and still retain this game's identity as a follow-up to Dead Space.<br/> <br/> I don't like to spend a lot of time describing the look of a game these days because, hey, it's 2011. That's what we produce videos for. But Dead Space 2's visuals are worth recognizing simply because they're so impressive. The amount of detail in every single room of Titan Station is downright baffling when you consider that someone had to model and texture and assign physical properties to every single surface and object in there. I'm not trying to equate more detail with a better visual style or something, but the game's environments have a stunning amount of craft in them. There's also a great, restrained use of lighting that helps to heighten the tension from area to area. The sound design is just as appropriately horrific; some of the sounds the new necromorphs make from the shadows, announcing their presence before you even see them, are absolutely bloodcurdling. It's a game that looks and sounds incredible, and one that, like the first Dead Space, demands the biggest screen and speakers you can give it.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1519128-dead_space_2_mp_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1519128\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1519128-dead_space_2_mp_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1519128\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1519128-dead_space_2_mp_6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1519128-dead_space_2_mp_6.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> There is also multiplayer.</figcaption></figure>     Dead Space 2 has multiplayer, though I wouldn't have told you the game needed it, based on the way it plays. But it turns out the multiplayer isn't half bad. Here is where I make the requisite \"<a data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3025-1342/\" slug=\"left-4-dead\"> Left 4 Dead</a> Space\" joke and tell you that it pits four human players against four necromorphs in an objective-based format that flips the two sides after one round. And just like in <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\" href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374/\" slug=\"valve-corporation\"> Valve</a>'s series, the humans are relatively hearty while the monsters are frail as all get out, meaning the players on the monster side will respawn repeatedly as fast as they can to prevent the humans from reaching their goal before time expires. The game only ships with five maps, but it does have a progression-based leveling system that unlocks new weapons and abilities. That provides a decent carrot for you to chase after, and there's some room for coordinated teams to strategize against less-organized opponents and achieve dominance. The multiplayer doesn't seem especially deep, though, and consequently I suspect it will lose its luster after a week or two.<br/> <br/> The good news is the campaign alone is worth playing through two or even three times. I personally enjoyed Dead Space 2 so much that I played through the PlayStation 3 version start to finish, then immediately started another run on the 360, and plan to play it again on the highest difficulty after that. Coming from someone who rarely has the time or interest to play a game more than once, that's saying something. It helps that the designers got the whole \"new-game-plus\" thing right this time around by allowing you to take your upgraded weapons and gear into subsequent playthroughs, and also that there are numerous achievements and trophies that reward multiple, harder runs through the game(though none, it's worth pointing out, that apply to multiplayer). The two console versions looked virtually identical to me, but I have to give a slight nod to the PlayStation 3 version simply because it ships on one disc, while the Xbox game comes on two and features a disc swap halfway through. The first production run of the PS3 version also contains the previously Wii-exclusive prequel <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25358\" href=\"/dead-space-extraction/3030-25358/\" slug=\"dead-space-extraction\"> Dead Space Extraction</a> dressed up with HD graphics, optional Move support, and trophies, though subsequent pressings will lose that bonus. For the time being at least, that's a pretty valuable bonus.<br/> <br/> Just like its predecessor, Dead Space 2 doesn't do anything especially new, it just does everything exceedingly well. EA's current management set a mandate a few years ago to improve the quality of the company's internal game development, a directive this game and its predecessor directly resulted from.

And, if you're looking at the single-player \"story\" side of the game, you're right, it's not a huge shift. But all of the underlying bits have become significantly more sophisticated, allowing players to take the level creation tools and create some incredible things. Those tools mean that levels that fall outside of the standard platforming genre are now easier to create, exponentially expanding the sorts of levels that an average person with a ton of free time can make. On top of that, LBP2 is better about getting you into those levels, with a lot of great filters and options that make finding the best stuff easier than it's ever been. It's an intensely charming and engaging game that really stands out as one of the smoothest examples of how to handle <a data-ref-id=\"3015-129\" href=\"/user-generated-content/3015-129/\" slug=\"user-generated-content\">user-generated content</a> on a console.<br/> <br/> The story mode is structured a lot like the first game's, and it serves the same basic purpose. There's an evil force out there, and you'll work with a batch of \"Creators\" to right the wrongs and get things back to normal. It feels like these levels are largely designed to introduce you to the new mechanics of LBP2, like a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-5\" href=\"/grapple/3055-5/\" slug=\"grapple\">grappling hook</a> that you can use for swinging and climbing, or the grabinator, a pair of gloves that let you pick up and toss objects. You'll also start to get a sense of how you might use these new things in your own levels. You'll also get a user's-eye look at the controllinator, which is an in-game device that can be hooked up to allow you to use the DualShock to control objects other than <a data-ref-id=\"3005-663\" href=\"/sackboy/3005-663/\" slug=\"sackboy\">Sackboy</a>. This is what allows you to control cars, play dual-joystick shooters, fly <a href=\"http://lbp.me/v/wjyw-r\" rel=\"nofollow\">lunar landers</a>, or just about anything else you can come up with. It's a big part of what makes LBP2 so much broader than its predecessor.<br/> <br/> The single-player is a brief romp that, as before, is practically required since you'll unlock a ton of objects and stickers for use in the create mode. Interacting with the level creation tools hasn't changed a lot since the first game, though there are plenty of required tutorials to go through before you can really start creating your own levels. You'll still shuffle objects back and forth along the three usable planes, and you're still represented in the creator as a floating Sackboy, as opposed to a mouse cursor or anything, well, \"tool-like.\" While the tools are pretty easy to use and are usually explained well by the 50+ tutorials, getting in there and creating something awesome isn't an especially fast process. It seems like a mouse or a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4669\" href=\"/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/\" slug=\"playstation-move-support\">PlayStation Move</a> controller would make things happen more quickly, but the game doesn't currently support either. Word is that a patch is on the way, though.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82962/1639480-a_photo_14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1639480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82962/1639480-a_photo_14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1639480\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82962/1639480-a_photo_14.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The official levels will introduce you to the basic concepts.</figcaption></figure>     Let's face it: Most of us are never going to put in the time it takes to build a world-class LittleBigPlanet 2 level. But there are plenty of people out there giving it their all, and the game is superb when it comes to sifting through these levels and getting the best of the best into your hands. The community section has plenty of filters that let you look at the highest-rated levels, the newest, or ones that are marked with specific tags. So if you want the newest levels that employ the controllinator (which is my current favorite way to sort it all), you can do exactly that. You can also do all of this while you're away from your PS3 via lbp.me, the game's official site. The site has a great database of user-created levels, along with all of the review, rating, and tag data that comes along with them. If you feed the site your PSN login credentials, you can even add any levels that look interesting to a queue. When you fire up the game, it'll immediately notice the list of levels you lined up and let you dive right into those without any more work. It's one of the best ways to integrate a website with a game that I've seen so far, and it's become my preferred way to find and share user levels.<br/> <br/> There's an awful lot of wonder and joy to be found in those user levels. It starts by being fully compatible with levels created in the first game, giving you a great base to start with. But a lengthy beta and a collection of busy creators have been putting LBP2's improved tools to great use, resulting in goofy fighting games, better basketball games, multiplayer shooters, bootleg versions of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda\">The Legend of Zelda</a>'s first dungeon, a zillion levels with unlicensed <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1\" href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a> elements, and that's only scratching the surface. Some players are just building machinima-style movies with the level tools and telling their own stories. Even the music levels that just play MIDI-like versions of real songs are better thanks to a rebuilt music sequencer.  The sheer number of levels can be a little overwhelming, but with the great level-sorting tools, it becomes easy to spend hours just checking out and rating the work of others and leave you wanting even more.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1692646-303070f4ff8c5beb53b3bccae56f7398fdf44e73.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1692646\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1692646-303070f4ff8c5beb53b3bccae56f7398fdf44e73.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1692646\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1692646-303070f4ff8c5beb53b3bccae56f7398fdf44e73.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1692646-303070f4ff8c5beb53b3bccae56f7398fdf44e73.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>What you do with those basic concepts? That's your business... and Nintendo's business, now that I think about it. </figcaption></figure>     The only downside is more a matter of taste than a genuine issue: the platforming action of the core LBP gameplay is largely unchanged. Considering the backwards compatibility, it's easy to understand why Sackboy still moves and jumps the way he does, but it never feels like it's quite responsive enough. Granted, that's sort of a perception issue that comes from me spending so many years playing platformers, and well-designed levels (like the official levels) aren't built in a way that makes this a glaring issue. I guess I just wish that Sackboy jumped a little higher? Regardless, if the way Sackboy moves turned you off two years ago, it's still going to bother you in LBP2.<br/> <br/> The tool upgrades given to creators in LittleBigPlanet 2 are enough to make the game feel pretty fresh, making the game worthwhile even if you never actually delve into the creation mode yourself. But if you've got a great level idea burning a hole in your brain, and don't mind putting in a grip of time to get it just right, you'll find the tools to be pretty accommodating once you learn how they all work. Me, I'm perfectly content with just surfing through the lists of levels, picking out the craziest examples I can find, and losing myself in a world of twisted Mario clones, shooters, and levels loosely based on feature films. So get out there and create some more of those for me, cool?", "deck": "The variety afforded by LBP2's more sophisticated tools allow creators to build levels that are exponentially more complicated and interesting than what was possible in the first game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-358/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31214/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/littlebigplanet-2/3030-31214/", "id": 31214, "name": "LittleBigPlanet 2"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2011-01-26 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101783/", "id": 101783, "name": "LittleBigPlanet 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/bionic-commando-rearmed-2-review/1900-359/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16396/1676465-bcr2a__5_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676465\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16396/1676465-bcr2a__5_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676465\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16396/1676465-bcr2a__5_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>When you fly over a level, you get control of a mounted gun that lays waste to anything that gets close. </figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30945\" href=\"/bionic-commando-rearmed-2/3030-30945/\" slug=\"bionic-commando-rearmed-2\">Bionic Commando Rearmed 2</a> is the sequel to a game that was designed as a remake of an 8-bit classic. It probably would have been easy to just design more levels to fit those mechanics and pump it out on the heels of Rearmed, which seemed to be a pretty popular release. Instead, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6781\" href=\"/fatshark-ab/3010-6781/\" slug=\"fatshark-ab\">Fatshark</a> went the other way with it and modernized a lot of the mechanics, making for more nuanced control of your grappling arm and easier access to multiple weapons and abilities. One of those adjustments? You can <i>jump</i> now. Considering that \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-1852\" href=\"/no-jumping/3015-1852/\" slug=\"no-jumping\">no jumping</a>\" was sort of a key feature of the previous game, you might think that hopping around ruins the feel and flavor of the whole thing. But that's not the problem with BCR2. It controls really well and swinging and jumping around the levels is great. It's the levels themselves, which feel really disjointed from each other, making it easy to forget why you're swinging around in the first place.<br/> <br/> Going from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20483\" href=\"/bionic-commando-rearmed/3030-20483/\" slug=\"bionic-commando-rearmed\">Bionic Commando Rearmed</a> to BCR2 takes some time, because the controls have been largely redesigned to allow you to jump. Also, you can start swinging from a standstill, retract or extend your arm at will, and the button that extends the arm also now releases it, preventing you from mashing the button as you fall in hopes of saving yourself from certain doom. While you'll probably hate it for the first 30 minutes or so, the control you have over your arm and how it's used is better here than it was in the past, and once you get the particulars of it down, you'll be swinging around as before, only touching the ground when you really feel like it.<br/> <br/> You'll also have new abilities at your disposal in the form of active upgrades. These let you add electricity to your arm to shock enemies, or utilize a grenade launcher. There's a powerful uppercut that you can use to bowl barrels into the opposition. The catch is that all of these abilities are governed by a single, slow-to-fill meter, and though you can use any of the abilities anytime you like, you have to go into a sub-screen to equip a single ability. There are also passive upgrades, such as regenerating ammo or faster movement. Similar to the active upgrades, you have to select which passive upgrade you want to use at any given time, though you can swap them out at will on the sub-screen. The end result of all this sub-screen swapping is that I didn't really spend much time using the different abilities. Why bother pausing to select your hacking tool to freeze all of the robotic enemies for a few seconds when you can just swing past it all and keep moving?<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1411124-22_tr_bioniccommandorearmed2e3_061710_1500_25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411124\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1411124-22_tr_bioniccommandorearmed2e3_061710_1500_25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1411124\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1411124-22_tr_bioniccommandorearmed2e3_061710_1500_25.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can opt to finish the game without jumping, if you like. </figcaption></figure>     Like the previous game, BCR2 is broken up into areas, but it's a mostly linear progression that doesn't give you much reason to revisit earlier levels unless you're hell-bent on finding every single upgrade. Most of the levels are very straightforward in a \"just get to the end\" sort of way, though some are given a bit of variety with helicopter sequences that fly you over most of the level while you keep the chopper safe from a turret position. Your progression is broken up by a handful of boss fights, which are pattern-based and monotonous. The problem isn't that they rely on patterns, it's more that most of them play out slowly and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-124\" href=\"/nathan-rad-spencer/3005-124/\" slug=\"nathan-rad-spencer\">Nathan \"Rad\" Spencer</a> isn't terribly resilient. So you need to memorize the attack patterns and not screw them up and take damage as you wait for your opportunity to dish out some damage of your own. It doesn't help that some of these already-tired boss fights show up multiple times over the course of the game. Fighting a giant, metal gorilla sounds like a pretty awesome deal, but fighting the same one twice while making sure you're timing your jumps just so as to avoid its hands from hitting you is just straight-up boring.<br/> <br/> It's a shame that the boss fights are weak, because most of the other action in BCR2 is at least as good as its predecessor. The weapons are decent, though I found myself sticking to the default weapon most of the time rather than worrying about the limited ammo on the rest of the guns. The levels get tough, but the game rarely feels unfair or too crazy. If you're looking for something extra, the game has a set of VR-style challenge rooms that are a lot rougher than anything you'll face in the main game, and these focus on the sort of precise swinging that you'll only be good at after sinking some hours into the game. Also, like the previous Rearmed, BCR2 has a local co-op mode. Players are forced to stick to the same screen, which puts a premium on actual cooperation, but feels too restricting to be much fun.<br/> <br/> BCR2 looks nice and makes good use of its polygonal nature with some big, physics-y explosions that look really nice, and there's a good amount of variety to the looks of the different levels, taking you through prisons, sand temples, jungle settings, and so on. The soundtrack once again plants its flag firmly in the retro category, with new remixes of tracks from the original game. They're pretty good, but if I had to choose, I prefer the previous game's soundtrack.<br/> <br/> Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 controls well, but the game wrapped around those controls is only great in fits and starts. The additional abilities aren't as useful as they could have been and the game's boss fights are extreme momentum killers. When you're swinging and jumping around, it's grand. But BCR2 grinds to a halt too frequently, making parts of it more frustrating and disappointing than they needed to be.", "deck": "Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 has the right idea when it comes to revamping its controls, but the level and boss design brings things crashing to a halt.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-359/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store, PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30945/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bionic-commando-rearmed-2/3030-30945/", "id": 30945, "name": "Bionic Commando Rearmed 2"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-02-07 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-94915/", "id": 94915, "name": "Bionic Commando Rearmed 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/stacking-review/1900-360/", "description": "<p style=\"\">The plight of the proletariat has never been so preciously portrayed as it is in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33251\" href=\"/stacking/3030-33251/\" slug=\"stacking\">       Stacking</a>, the latest game from the newly download-focused developers at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2215\" href=\"/double-fine-productions-inc/3010-2215/\" slug=\"double-fine-productions-inc\">          Double Fine Productions</a>. Set against the backdrop of the industrial revolution's autumn years, Stacking uses the concept of Russian stacking dolls as the core conceit for its puzzling adventure. As a sentient doll in a world full of dolls, you use your ability to stack with larger dolls to take control of them, thus giving you access to their unique abilities to solve world-based puzzles and defeat plutocratic greed in the name of the working class. Not exactly the kind of subject matter one tends to find in games intended to amuse and inspire warm feelings, but honestly, when has Double Fine ever stuck to tried-and-true, broad-spectrum comedy? That the brains behind Stacking were able to create such an engaging and chuckle-worthy puzzle game around such depressingly bleak concepts as child labor and the working man's burden is, in a weird way, almost par for the course with this studio.  <br/> <br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20887/1639193-charlie1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1639193\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20887/1639193-charlie1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1639193\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20887/1639193-charlie1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You're a good man, Charlie Blackmore.</figcaption></figure>     In the game, you are Charlie Blackmore, the lil'est child born into a family of hard-working chimney sweeps mired in debt, poverty, and (paradoxically) almost disconcerting levels of hope and positivity. One day the family patriarch returns to inform his family of good news: the local baron (whose industries seem to mostly revolve around indistinct acts of evil, hatred of children, and a generalized insidiousness) has hired him on, meaning the family's money troubles have come to an end. Grand news, until father disappears, and the baron's cronies come for the rest of the Blackmore brood to pay off his debts--except, of course, for Charlie, who is far too little, and thus far too incapable of manual labor to be of use to the baron. As it turns out, the children are being held prisoner along with myriad other adorable scamps who should all be enjoying the innocence of their formative years, and not toiling away in the bowels of luxury ships and monstrous zeppelins as chimney sweeps, coal shovelers, and, most undignified of all, <i>waiters.</i> <br/> <br/>So Charlie sets off on a mission to rescue his family, despite many a doubt about his fortitude, due to his minuscule stature. Good, then, that he can stack with other dolls to make himself larger, and able to solve the problems that unfold in front of him. Stacking's mechanics are simple enough. As you move around the world, you need only to sneak up behind an unsuspecting doll and press a single button to essentially possess them for as long as you please. The only requirement is size. The doll you stack with must be one size larger than you, though once you have a larger doll, you can then stack multiple dolls atop one another until you've run out of sizes to ascend. In effect, you can possess the souls of several different people at once, and use their bodies to do as you please. There's something vaguely terrifying about that idea, but hey, it's all in the name of saving your family. <br/> <br/>Each doll that occupies this world has a specific ability. Some of these are little more than trifling amusements (that occasionally still solve puzzles), like the ability to cough sickly on other people, or the ability to fart at will. Others are a bit more generally useful, like a boxer being able to deliver a \"proper uppercut\" to anyone and anything nearby, or a fancy lass who can immediately identify other dolls who are \"important.\" Others still are very specifically useful for certain puzzle objectives within a given level.  <br/> <br/>There's a wide variety of dolls to inhabit and use throughout each of the game's four main levels, and though not all of them seem immediately useful, many actually have some function within the game's more opaque puzzle solutions. Every level presents multiple problems that must be solved, be it guards that must be lured away from doors, caviar-consuming aristocrats who must be denied their delicious delicacies, or gigantic goons who must be scared, sickened or stiffened in the name of rescuing a family member. Every one of these objectives comes with multiple solutions. For instance, a guard could be dispatched by stacking up a fire chief doll (who comes complete with a fire hose atop his head) and a doll encumbered with a freezing fan, then using their abilities in combination to wet, then freeze the hapless fellow. If that's not to your liking, how about inhabiting a waiter doll who permanently travels around with a bowl of soup for a hat?

It is very occasionally possible to solve a puzzle using a method not intended by the designers, which rewards you with nothing more than the knowledge that you're smarter than the people who make the games you buy, and an ultimately empty feeling in your heart. It's a rare enough issue, thankfully, and if you're the sort that likes a challenge, many of the puzzles offer extremely off-kilter solutions for you to deduce.  <br/> <br/>As for those who aren't into completionism? There is, thankfully, a reasonably obvious solution in front of you in most cases, meaning you rarely have to push your logic skills to their limits if you just want to progress through the story. The downside to that methodology is that you skip roughly half the game in the process. Aiming to do everything nets you a little over six hours of game to play through, but skipping the extra solutions results in a game that's roughly half that length. The good news? You can always go back and play through the stuff you skipped, should you feel so inclined. Still, if you're dead-set on blowing through the story and ignoring the content that lies beneath the beaten path, you could be forgiven for finding the game's $15 price tag a touch steep.<br/> <br/>Still, you may find yourself compelled to explore, even if you're vehemently anti-exploration in most games. Though you'll see the bulk of the game's humor and plot just by going one-and-done on each puzzle, there are hidden objectives, obscure secondary dolls, and a variety of goofy sight gags you might not see on a cursory first playthrough. Double Fine has done a fine job of crafting a relatively expansive open world that's actually pretty fun to paw through. Perhaps taking a cue from the design concept of \"big, but not huge\" that governed <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32304\" href=\"/costume-quest/3030-32304/\" slug=\"costume-quest\">     Costume Quest's</a> world designs, it's easy to get lost exploring each stage's nooks and crannies, though you'll never actually <i>be </i>lost if you have somewhere you're aiming to go.  <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20887/1639197-seduce6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1639197\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20887/1639197-seduce6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1639197\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20887/1639197-seduce6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20887/1639197-seduce6.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> There are multiple ways to lure this guard away. This one is the most erotic.</figcaption></figure>     As they are often wont to do, Double Fine has imbued Stacking with its trademark sense of humor. The entirety of the game's story is presented in cutscenes steeped in the sepia-toned silence of the earliest films, with large title cards spelling out the dialogue the dolls have with one another through wild gesticulation--despite their lack of limbs, they're awfully expressive--and old timey piano music signaling the moments of tragedy and triumph with delightful results. The early goings of the game are perhaps more clever than legitimately funny--you get a lot of moments that inspire thoughts like \"Yes, that was quite amusing\" than actual, bona fide laughter. But as the game rolls on, the sets and scenarios get increasingly elaborate, and the humor follows suit. There are some truly excellent comedy bits peppered throughout the adventure; the scene leading up to the final confrontation of the game, in particular, is the first legitimate belly laugh I've gotten out of a game in ages. <br/> <br/>Stacking looks like a trifling little downloadable title, but the game has a surprising amount of heart. There's nothing particularly heady about the game, mind you. Its a relatively easy-going puzzle game that only rarely, truly challenges, and it uses its marginally Marxist leanings to send up wanton materialism in a fairly lightweight and cartoonish way--though, that said, if you're the sort of person who clings aggressively to Ayn Rand's writings, enjoys the meaning behind Neil Peart's lyrics, and/or unironically considers themselves a monocle enthusiast, be forewarned, you may be <i>horrified.</i> By the same token, every time Charlie encounters a new character, a new situation, or a new environment in Stacking, you can't help but smile at the painstakingly crafted silliness of it all. Similarly, it's hard not to love the all-too-obvious metaphor of a family's need to stick (or stack, in this case) together to succeed--a metaphor that plays out beautifully in the final moments of the game. Like its pint-sized protagonist, Stacking is a small game with scads of pluck and spirit, and only the stingiest, penny-pinchingest players would fail to find <i>something</i> lovable about it.", "deck": "Both a well-crafted puzzle game and a good-natured send-up of antiquated industrialist politics, Stacking is one of the more satisfyingly strange downloadable games you're likely to encounter.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-360/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3), Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33251/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/stacking/3030-33251/", "id": 33251, "name": "Stacking"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-02-08 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-107418/", "id": 107418, "name": "Stacking"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mario-sports-mix-review/1900-361/", "description": "<p style=\"\">This statement might come off like the apocryphal ranting of an alarmist  lunatic, but it needs to be said: I think we've hit the limit of what  can be done creatively with the mascot sports game genre.

This is a fine-sounding collection on paper that, nevertheless, fails to impress due to Squeenix's lackluster execution. Each included game offers just enough  mechanically to qualify as \"sport,\" and the precise minimum amount of  Nintendo-brand goofiness to fill the appropriate \"Mario\" quotient. Take  dodgeball as a prime example. What is typically portrayed as a fairly  fast-paced game of exciting injuries is flatly trotted out here as the dullest game of \"toss the ball and hope someone has their back turned\" ever created.  Seriously, unless you or  your opponent have your back turned, it's way easy to just catch  the ball and toss it back in ceaseless volleys. Never mind that it takes multiple hits to  knock out any player on the field, and never mind that your Mario-fied  special moves are either insanely overpowered, or insanely useless,  depending on which specific character you're controlling...actually,  never mind what I just said. I did mind <i>all of that.</i><br/> <br/> Though dodgeball is ostensibly the worst of the bunch, all the other  sports suffer from similarly lacking forethought and fun. Volleyball just has you endlessly running to a marked spot on the  sand/blacktop/rotating thing that is sometimes on fire, and simply waggling the Wii remote to hit the ball, with the perpetual hope that  someone on the other team will magically not make it to the marked  circle on their side of the net in time. Basketball is more or less the  same core experience you may have played in Mario Hoops, minus the stylus  action. You pass, you steal, you shoot, and you dunk all over <a data-ref-id=\"3005-785\" href=\"/waluigi/3005-785/\" slug=\"waluigi\">       Waluigi's</a>  punk ass using fairly simplified controls that result in a lot of  scoring, and not a great deal of defense--except against the toughest  AI, in which case the inverse is true. Hockey is simultaneously the best  and most disappointing of the games. The pace is quick and some of the scoring special moves are cool, but the hitting feels severely weak, and scoring is completely out of  control on the earlier difficulty levels, and damn near impossible on  the higher ones.<br/> <br/> Hockey's problems actually speak to an issue with Mario Sports Mix's AI across  the board, one that rears its head in especially ugly fashion during the  game's assorted tournaments. On the opening difficulty levels, Mario  Sports Mix is absurdly easy. I'm not talking on a normal kid's game  level, either. A child would have a field day bowling over these  stump-dumb meatheads, which makes the fact that you have to play  through multiple matches in each tournament on these borderline  brain-dead difficulties absolutely maddening. For one level--the one  before the toughest--the AI puts up what one might call a reasonable,  challenging fight. Then you go onto the toughest level, and all reason  flies out the window as you get obliterated over and over. <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406803-tr_sportsmix_061510_1500_48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406803\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406803-tr_sportsmix_061510_1500_48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406803\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1406803-tr_sportsmix_061510_1500_48.jpg\"></a><figcaption> If you can run into giant colored circles, you can be successful at this game's version of volleyball.</figcaption></figure>     Other pervasive problems rear their head as well. The pacing of  basketball and hockey seem right, until the scoring starts happening.  Every time you score a goal or a basket, the game resets to  half-court/center-ice. That's normal for hockey, but the frequency of  scoring--especially in games against the AI--means that a three-minute  period can last up to 10-to-15 minutes if you or the computer  continuously scores. At one point in an easy tournament match I just  resorted to playing keep away for two-and-a-half minutes, after I'd  already scored ten goals. In basketball, this constant resetting is  nothing short of deadly to the pace of the game.  <br/> <br/>Similarly a problem  across all included games is the obnoxious method of player  switching. Passing a ball or puck to a computer-controlled teammate does  not automatically switch control to that player--you have to press a button to manually make the switch. In multiplayer matches  this is not much of a problem, since theoretically you have real  teammates who do not require your constant babysitting, but when you  have the computer on your side, this is awful. On lower settings, they never quite seem to  know what to do with the ball or puck, and if you happen to  be playing on one of the wackier stages, they rarely can figure out how to  get around the bugged-out obstacles that pop up, which  makes that extra step of having to manually switch control deeply  annoying.<br/> <br/> There are also four included mini-games, each loosely wrapped around the  mechanics of one of the main sports. For instance, Feed Petey uses  basketball as a base to create a game where up to four players run  around, collecting low-hanging fruit of varying point values, and then  run them up to a giant Petey plant to stuff down his gullet. That game  contains a certain level of controlled-chaos that is mildly amusing in a  multiplayer setting, but the pace of it isn't nearly exciting enough to  amuse beyond a few playthroughs with friends. Other mini-games fare less favorably.  Smash Skate revolves exclusively around  knocking people off of a platform using hockey checks, which barely seem  to register at times. Harmony Hustle is literally a game built around  players running to marked spots on a field in correct time...to make  awful, chintzy sounding notes from a classic video game tune.  <br/> <br/>Some of these problems are lessened when playing in multiplayer, which you can do offline or on (against coded friends or uncoded strangers), but even at the game's height of playability, Mario Sports Mix simply comes across like a bizarre copy of a copy. It's a  fax-machine quality retread of such startling inanity that,  at a point, you might actually find your fond memories of Mario sports games past overwritten by this blur of dispassionate mediocrity.

Playing <a data-ref-id=\"3010-154\" href=\"/jellyvision/3010-154/\" slug=\"jellyvision\"> Jellyvision’s</a> new <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31816\" href=\"/you-dont-know-jack/3030-31816/\" slug=\"you-dont-know-jack\"> You Don’t Know Jack</a> game, I almost immediately realized that we were all poorer for its absence. Though there have been ample trivia games in the interim, none have delivered the same balance of quick wit and smart questions that, during the mid-to-late '90s, defined the series. Trivia games always need a hook, whether that means really committing to the game-show or board-game conceit, or focusing on particular topics. For You Don’t Know Jack, it’s all about interweaving truly trivial pop culture with high culture and recontextualizing everything for maximum irreverence. I guess what I’m trying to say is that it’s really <i>funny</i>, a characteristic that continues to be a perennial blind spot in the world of video games.<br/> <br/> Speaking broadly, it’s kind of startling how little fiddling Jellyvision seems to have done with the old YDKJ formula here, and if you have fond memories from the 1990s of huddling around a PC, chuckling at fake backstage banter and silly mock commercials, you ought to know what to expect, almost to a vertigo-inducing degree. The basic structure of a game; the simple, colorful look of the motion graphics that dominate the game’s visuals; hell, they even got <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17916\" href=\"/cookie-masterson/3005-17916/\" slug=\"cookie-masterson\"> Cookie Masterson</a> back as the disembodied host voice, who was the most prolific (also, totally the best!) YDKJ host during the series’ original run. But that doesn’t mean this is just a nostalgia trip, and while the text-heavy presentation might feel a little dated, there’s nothing about the game’s structure that feels exclusionary for new players. The group that potentially won’t get as much enjoyment out of YDKJ are those unfamiliar with American pop culture, which the game mines relentlessly for its sense of humor and much of the actual trivia.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1701012-dod.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1701012\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56375\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1701012-dod.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1701012\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/1701012-dod.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You can get with Dis, or you can get with Dat.</figcaption></figure>     In YDKJ, up to four players compete through ten rounds of questions, with the speed of your response determining how much cash you’ll win or lose in that round. Though most are straightforward (in format, at least) multiple choice questions, you’ll encounter rapid-fire rounds like “DisOrDat” where you’re presented with a series of things that you have to categorize as one of two things, and games culminate in a “Jack Attack” round where pairs of phrases appear on the screen and you have to buzz in whenever they match, based on a clue you’re given before the round starts. In multiplayer--which is really the ideal way to play YDKJ, and there’s something kind of sad about playing a trivia game all by yourself--each player is given a “screw” at the start of the game. When a question comes up that you think another player doesn’t know the answer to, you can trigger the screw, immediately forcing that to make a guess, with raised stakes for both players.  <br/> <br/>Everything I’ve just described about YDKJ is just as applicable to the very first game in the series as it is to this brand-new 2011 release, and I think that’s a good thing. Trivia games that rely <i>purely</i> on trivia knowledge are dry, but games that rely too heavily on random reversals of fortune are just frustrating. You need a little random chance, and it doesn’t hurt when you build some vindictiveness into the format, because getting ahead is more fun when you’re pushing someone else down in the process.<br/> <br/> All that’s not to say the game’s not without its tweaks. There are a few new types of questions to help keep things fresh, as well as a huge bonus for choosing one, <i>very specific</i> wrong answer in a game, but more significant is how the game hems closer to the faux-game-show format that the series has always implied by actually dividing it into discreet, static episodes, which means a couple things for the gameplay. On the upside, since the question ordering isn’t random, you’ll never see a question you’ve already been presented, unless you specifically go back and play an episode you’ve already seen. This, to me, is huge, since there is basically nothing worse in a trivia game than getting repeat questions. This structure also allows the game to build themed series’ of questions, often for contrasting comedic effect. The downside is that any given episode is, essentially, single use, since the same questions are presented in the same order, every time, though this is mitigated by the fact that there is just a huge number of episodes included with the game. A full game of YDKJ can be played in around 10 to 15 minutes, which means that you’re looking at roughly 15 to 20 hours of game time with all of the questions that are included on the disc. Jellyvision and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" slug=\"thq\"> THQ</a> have already released a DLC pack of additional questions, and seem to have plans for more down the road, potentially extending the game’s life even further.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1701010-screw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1701010\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56375\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1701010-screw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1701010\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/1701010-screw.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/1701010-screw.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Test your knowledge of video games! And prison!</figcaption></figure>     Ultimately, though, YDKJ’s biggest asset is the one that’s the most difficult to really describe--its deeply ingrained sense of humor. The writers at Jellyvision understand the delicate art of absurdist juxtaposition and good ol’ fashioned wordplay, mining such disparate sources as <i>Jersey Shore</i>, the periodic table of elements, Britney Spears songs, the seven deadly sins, ventriloquism, and Herman Melville’s <i>Moby Dick</i> for both questions and comedy, often in the same stroke. The jokes don’t always hit, but they’re generally of a high quality, and they come at you with incredible speed.<br/> <br/> I think it’s interesting that there’s some question as to whether YDKJ would’ve been better served as a purely downloadable title, since the series origins lie in the multimedia heyday of the mid-90s, where the CD-ROM storage medium itself was the lynchpin of the entire experience. Either way, I think this game represents a terrific value, not just in terms of sheer volume, but the level of craft that is so often notably absent from trivia video games.    ", "deck": "It’s not built to last, but Jellyvision’s revival of one of video games’ smartest, funniest trivia series is pitch-perfect.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-362/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31816/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/you-dont-know-jack/3030-31816/", "id": 31816, "name": "You Don't Know Jack"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-02-09 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-105669/", "id": 105669, "name": "You Don't Know Jack"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds-review/1900-363/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1704327-galactus0055_00000_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1704327\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1704327-galactus0055_00000_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1704327\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1704327-galactus0055_00000_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Sometimes it's all just laser beams and HUD elements. </figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3025-173\" href=\"/marvel/3025-173/\" slug=\"marvel\">Marvel</a>-licensed fighting games have been a constant build-up of ridiculous combos and juggles layered on top of a faster and often-streamlined take on the company's traditional <a data-ref-id=\"3025-331\" href=\"/street-fighter/3025-331/\" slug=\"street-fighter\">Street Fighter</a> roots. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30944\" href=\"/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds/3030-30944/\" slug=\"marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds\">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a> continues the trend along various lines, resulting in a game that may still be totally indecipherable for the average fighting game fan, let alone a comic book guy who just wants to see <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1376\" href=\"/captain-america/3005-1376/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4899\" href=\"/thor/3005-4899/\" slug=\"thor\">Thor</a> beat up on a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-897\" href=\"/amaterasu/3005-897/\" slug=\"amaterasu\">wolf</a> that happens to be a Shinto sun goddess. Despite attempts to offer simpler control options, Capcom's latest will register with some folks as a set of flashing blasts of cycling colors that earns its epilepsy warning. But if you stare at it and persist long enough to see past MvC3's flashy presentation--and you're in a position to play with friends of a similar skill level on a regular basis--Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is actually kind of awesome. <br/><br/> It's weird to even say that, because a lot of the changes to the fighting systems in MvC3 have their roots in last year's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20728\" href=\"/tatsunoko-vs-capcom-ultimate-all-stars/3030-20728/\" slug=\"tatsunoko-vs-capcom-ultimate-all-stars\">Tatsunoko vs. Capcom</a>, which I kind of <i>hated</i>. Like that game, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 does away with separate buttons for punches and kicks, instead moving to three generic \"attack\" buttons for light, medium, and heavy. It's a dramatic change, and even after hours with the game, I still occasionally reach down for kick buttons that don't actually do what they're \"supposed\" to do. Decades-old habits are hard to break, and the game doesn't necessarily feel any less complicated due to this change. Though the way it genericizes combos across all characters with its <a data-ref-id=\"3025-960\" href=\"/street-fighter-alpha/3025-960/\" slug=\"street-fighter-alpha\">Alpha</a>-style L-&gt;M-&gt;H chains means that a lot of characters can bust out the same basic air combos using the same basic button presses. <br/><br/> If you've played any <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2612\" href=\"/marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes/3030-2612/\" slug=\"marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes\">Marvel vs. Capcom 2</a>, you've probably seen an air combo, where one player is launched into the air and decimated by a jumping attacker. The system wasn't exactly the easiest thing in the world to figure out, and the developers have simplified things a bit by devoting one button to your launcher, which lets you easily get guys up in the sky. By quickly chasing them up with a jump of your own, you can work your way up and down the attack buttons to execute air combos. You can also tag in one of your reserve characters mid-combo with this button. On the receiving end of a multi-character air combo, you're given the opportunity to break out of the combo by guessing which direction the attacking player is holding while attempting to tag in another character. The guessing game is easy to follow and the timing isn't too difficult to master, making the whole air combo thing feel a lot more manageable to a wider range of players, but since you can only break out when the attacker is tagging, the smarter attackers seem to just work in hyper combos and other single-character techniques instead of giving you an opportunity to escape further damage. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1710529-bdd067c8c50448833b999f5a03ab96a2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1710529\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1710529-bdd067c8c50448833b999f5a03ab96a2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1710529\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/1710529-bdd067c8c50448833b999f5a03ab96a2.jpg\"></a><figcaption> It's a game full of unlikely trios.</figcaption></figure>     If all of this \"combo system\" and \"hyper combo\" mumbo-jumbo sounds like too much for you to handle, the game offers a \"simple\" control scheme that reduces things even further, like giving you one attack button that you can just mash to perform combos and another that throws fireballs or performs other specials. While the notion of making the game more accessible to people who aren't already crazy fighting game guys is certainly sound, the normal controls in MvC3 aren't exactly rocket science, and simplifying the control even further doesn't do anything to take care of what really matters when it comes to enjoying the game. It doesn't help you develop a sense of the strategies that will help you win the match. Instead, the game sort of dumps you in and expects you to pick things up the way we all did back when arcades were king: by bashing your head against it for hours and hours and hours, all while hoping that you'll learn something along the way. While that certainly works, a proper tutorial that actually explains the basics would have worked wonders for players who look at the screen and just see four or five characters on the screen at all times and can't figure out what the hell is happening. Getting over that initial hump is key to enjoying everything that follows, and the game doesn't do a very good job of giving you a path or showing you what you're doing wrong. Instead it offers the same sort of list of combos that must be performed in the \"mission\" mode that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\" href=\"/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iv\">Street Fighter IV</a> had, only now you have to pause and go into a menu to see the controller motion versions of what it's asking you instead of a lengthy list of non-obvious move names like \"Million Dollars.\" It all feels like a missed opportunity to bring novice players a little deeper into the fold. <br/><br/> The game has a standard single-player mode with a decent final boss fight against Marvel's <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4845\" href=\"/galactus/3005-4845/\" slug=\"galactus\">Galactus</a>, though the endings aren't so great that you'll feel the immediate need to beat the game with every single character. As in just about every other fighting game ever made, the thing that keeps you coming back is the multiplayer. Locally, you can obviously sit with a friend and fight it out again and again. The game also has online support, which is reasonably good at matching you up with opponents and, when the network conditions are decent, the latency inherent to playing on the Internet isn't an issue. However, actually getting into a game might be harder than you've anticipated. Like Street Fighter IV and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28437\" href=\"/super-street-fighter-iv/3030-28437/\" slug=\"super-street-fighter-iv\">Super Street Fighter IV</a> before it, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has the same issue of often preventing you from connecting to other players. At one point, I had counted two actual matches sandwiched between over 30 failed attempts to connect. And as if that weren't bad enough, failed attempts knock you back one or two menus, forcing you to navigate back to the online menu before you can try again. With this continuing to be an issue, using the \"fight request\" system, which attempts to match you into online games while you play the single-player modes, is the best way to find fights. It's sad that this continues to be an issue for Capcom's fighting games. <br/><br/> In addition to playing against one other person, you can also organize lobbies for up to eight players in the standard format, where the winner continues to fight while losers are sent to the back of the line. But this mode doesn't contain any sort of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3179\" href=\"/spectating/3015-3179/\" slug=\"spectating\">spectate mode</a>, leaving you staring at a menu and the health meters of the currently active players. Unless you're the sort of person who wants to spend eight or nine minutes between matches chatting with other players--or if you're the sort of person that doesn't lose--this is a weak option, at best. And not to keep harping on the past, but this is also something that Capcom did very well in Super Street Fighter IV, making the whole thing even more confusing. Without it, group battles feel like a waste of time. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1702726-_oshadow0013_00000_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1702726\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1702726-_oshadow0013_00000_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1702726\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1702726-_oshadow0013_00000_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1702726-_oshadow0013_00000_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dante's guitar licks are MURDEROUS. </figcaption></figure>     It's easy to pick away at the edges of Marvel vs. Capcom 3. The menus could have been cleaner, the options could have been more robust. But the core action is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. The learning curve perhaps isn't quite as steep as Marvel vs. Capcom 2's was, and it's a great-looking game with over 30 characters that actually feel very different from each other. If you're into non-standard characters, the game has plenty of short dudes, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-895\" href=\"/viewtiful-joe/3005-895/\" slug=\"viewtiful-joe\">Viewtiful Joe</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-897\" href=\"/amaterasu/3005-897/\" slug=\"amaterasu\">Amaterasu</a>, or big lugs like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3337\" href=\"/sentinel/3005-3337/\" slug=\"sentinel\">Sentinel</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9897\" href=\"/modok/3005-9897/\" slug=\"modok\">MODOK</a>. If you're looking for bread-and-butter fighting game characters, guys like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1376\" href=\"/captain-america/3005-1376/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-103\" href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\" slug=\"ryu\">Ryu</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9899\" href=\"/super-skrull/3005-9899/\" slug=\"super-skrull\">Super-Skrull</a> all fit that basic bill. There's also a lot of great music in the game, including remixed versions of MvC2's character select screen music, which feels like a nice bit of silly fan service. Given the mashed-up nature of the game, there's a lot of solid fan service throughout, like a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4960\" href=\"/punisher/3005-4960/\" slug=\"punisher\">Punisher</a>-style Captain America costume and lots of references to various things from Capcom and Marvel's past.<br/><br/> There are also some nice things at the periphery of the game that make it more inviting, like the ability to create three different teams ahead of time as your \"reserve units.\" From the character select screen, you can pop up this list of teams and quickly select your favorites. Considering you need to pick three characters and three assist types every time you see a select screen, it's a great shortcut to have. There's also an in-game \"license card\" that shows you how you're doing, what your win/loss records are, which achievements or trophies you're close to unlocking, and a list of titles and icons to select from. <br/><br/> The key thing you need to know about Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is that just because you're a fighting game fan doesn't mean you're going to fit right in and have a good time. Capcom's Marvel-licensed fighting games have consistently been a different breed of crazy, over-the-top fighting that's just going to rub some people the wrong way no matter what. Even this attempt to simplify the action and make it more accessible isn't going to be enough for everyone. But if you've ever had an inkling of interest in Capcom's previous attempts but found them too impenetrable, MvC3 is probably your best bet at finally cracking that code and getting some enjoyment out of all this crossover madness. Just make sure you've got some like-minded, similarly skilled opposition to take on, or else it's going to get messy and decidedly unfun.    ", "deck": "While many will bristle at the mere sight of Marvel vs. Capcom 3's brand of crazy, it's actually a lot of fun once you put in some time and figure it all out.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-363/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30944/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds/3030-30944/", "id": 30944, "name": "Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-02-16 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-94917/", "id": 94917, "name": "Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/killzone-3-review/1900-364/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1715584-w9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1715584\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1715584-w9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1715584\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101494/1715584-w9.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You'll spend a bit of time manning turrets or driving vehicles in the campaign.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30431\" href=\"/killzone-3/3030-30431/\" slug=\"killzone-3\">Killzone 3</a> picks up right where <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20601\" href=\"/killzone-2/3030-20601/\" slug=\"killzone-2\">Killzone 2</a> left off in more ways than one. The campaign is a direct continuation of the previous game, picking up mere moments after you received a new reason to want to put a bullet in Rico's head. The design and structure of the game, also, feels like they're resuming where the last game left off. If you didn't play Killzone 2 after the \"high precision\" option was patched in, Killzone 3 will feel dramatically different, like a much faster game. If you kept current with the patches, it'll feel largely identical, with some of the same issues found in Killzone 2 sticking out more here if only because of their age. The major improvement is a bump up in graphical quality. When you consider how nice Killzone 2 looked when it launched two years ago, that's a substantial benefit.<br/><br/> After some quick tutorializing, the game drops you back into the boots of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3090\" href=\"/tomas-sevchenko/3005-3090/\" slug=\"tomas-sevchenko\">Tomas \"Sev\" Sevchenko</a> of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2823\" href=\"/interplanetary-strategic-alliance/3015-2823/\" slug=\"interplanetary-strategic-alliance\">ISA</a>. You've just witnessed the death of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-195\" href=\"/helghast/3015-195/\" slug=\"helghast\">Helghast</a> leader and it's time to get the heck out of there. But the evacuation process goes completely sideways and Sev, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1795\" href=\"/rico-velasquez/3005-1795/\" slug=\"rico-velasquez\">Rico</a>, and a group of other ISA soldiers are stranded. The bulk of Killzone 3 deals with the marooned troops biding their time and waiting for the right time to pick up the fight and escape the enemy's planet. Most of the actions you take are very standard first-person-shooter goals. You'll attempt to secure a convoy, you'll take to high ground to defend ground-based troops with a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">sniper rifle</a>, you'll destroy enemy installations, and so on. And, for the most part, it's fine, if a bit rote. The game's pacing is very stuttery as the game jumps from action to cutscene to action a little too often, and occasionally the story doesn't slow down to explain itself, like one portion of the game where you go from an on-foot cutscene to suddenly manning the turret in a vehicle that seems like it just kind of came out of nowhere. The game has a few of these turret sequences, and some of the game's biggest climactic moments are, unfortunately, seen from behind the controls of a mounted weapon. Add to that a real punch-out kind of \"big explosion followed <i>immediately</i> by end credits\" ending and it's easy to find disappointment in the campaign.<br/><br/> That's not to say that the action is bad. The battlefields that you'll cross while playing through the campaign look great, and the enemies are usually reasonably fun to kill. The weapon loadout has changed a bit this time around, allowing you to carry a heavy weapon while still carrying an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-413\" href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" slug=\"assault-rifle\">assault rifle</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotgun</a>, making heavy weapons more useful. So you'll grab light machine guns, snap turrets off of their mounts, and find <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">rocket launchers</a>, boltguns, and other military hardware that helps keep the combat exciting. It's just annoying that Killzone 3's campaign doesn't seem to care about continuity or finding interesting ways to tell its story. One of the coolest moments--the game opens with you controlling a man in Helghast armor and ends with a climactic moment before giving you a \"six months earlier\" cut back to where the story actually begins--is undercut when you revisit that same moment later on in the story and it unfolds <i>completely differently</i> than it did when you were there the first time. With the developers not bothering to care enough about their fiction to create what could have been a cool moment the second time around, it instead comes off as if a few people working on the levels didn't communicate well enough to synch up the action. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1715589-w14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1715589\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1715589-w14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1715589\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101494/1715589-w14.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You'll still want to shoot them in the head, if you can.</figcaption></figure>         As in Killzone 2, you'll usually roll with an AI-controlled partner or two, and if you or one of your teammates goes down in battle, you can revive each other. There are still too many cases in Killzone 3 where you seem to have been brought down in a clear area that wouldn't take Rico long to get into and heal you, but instead he just screams \"I can't reach you!\" and you're left to die and return to the last checkpoint. It's a sound idea that still ends up causing more frustration than it avoids. The game offers a cooperative campaign, which mitigates this specific issue, but it's only available in an offline, split-screen form, which is a little ridiculous in this day and age. <br/><br/> And then there's the multiplayer. It's real, proper multiplayer for up to 24 players online, though you can also play all of the modes and maps with <a data-ref-id=\"3015-597\" href=\"/ai-bots/3015-597/\" slug=\"ai-bots\">bots</a> by yourself, if you like. The \"botzone\" is also useful because it lets you see and try all of the various gear that you can unlock for the different classes in Killzone 3. Since you'll earn one unlock point for each level of experience gained when playing online, and later weapons cost three points to open up, it's worth spending some time with the bots first, if only to avoid a situation where you're unlocking weapons you won't actually like. That third <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2488\" href=\"/medic/3015-2488/\" slug=\"medic\">medic</a> weapon, which is silenced and shoots three-shot bursts, isn't for everyone. Those are points that you could also spend to allow your engineer class to build turrets more quickly or increase the effective range of the infiltrator's disguise ability. Point being, the classes give you a range of different ways to play the game that should fit a variety of play styles. Classes are a little less configurable than they've been in the past, though, as the unlocks are limited to the class they were designed for. You can't mix-and-match badges to form a class that can revive players and rebuild supply points, for example. In-game actions can reward you with ribbons that give you a bonus for the rest of that match, so you can unlock faster aim abilities or double XP on kills by performing specific tasks. The effect is similar to the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3015-366\" href=\"/perks/3015-366/\" slug=\"perks\">perk</a> system, but they're completely temporary and usually doled out for good behavior, like completing objectives in a team match or getting a lot of assists. <br/><br/> Killzone 3 gets down to business with three multiplayer modes. Guerilla Warfare is the game's way of saying \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">Team Deathmatch</a>.\" Warzone, which rolls a lot of standard objective-based modes into one big game that randomly rotates through objectives every five minutes or so, is still the coolest mode in the game, and it's a great way to keep players on their toes. Operations mode is an attack-and-defend mode where one team is trying to complete various objectives while the other is always on defense. As the objectives are met or failed, cutscenes are played showing the players on both teams engaged in moving a crane or executing prisoners or whatever that specific objective was tied to in the \"story\" of that match. Those cutscenes make it cooler than the average <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3294\" href=\"/assault/3015-3294/\" slug=\"assault\">assault</a>-style mode, but since one team is always attacking and the other is always defending, it doesn't keep players on their toes quite as much as Warzone does. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25993/1386910-xxq6o8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1386910\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.97276995305164\" data-width=\"1065\" style=\"width: 1065px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25993/1386910-xxq6o8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1386910\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25993/1386910-xxq6o8.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/25993/1386910-xxq6o8.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>And here are some more shots of the Helghast looking menacing. </figcaption></figure>         The multiplayer in Killzone 3 is less configurable than it was in the previous game. For players who set up Killzone 2 Warzone matches and reduced them to one or two specific game types and restricted the use of certain weapons and badges, this will be disappointing. But if you were tired of trying to jump into a game and having to sift through a list of servers before finding one that was actually playing Warzone \"properly,\" you'll be pleased to know that you can't turn anything off. In fact, you can't even \"create\" a match at all anymore. The only options are the game modes, and once you're in there, the only option is \"find match.\" Once you're in the game, you'll find that the squad concepts used in Killzone 2 are gone. There are still \"squads\" in the game, but these are temporary groups of up to eight players that exist outside of the action, sort of like Halo's party system. This means that you can't fill a whole match with your friends, as there's no private match option. This seems like something of an oversight. <br/><br/> But the main action is still just as satisfying as it was last time around, with a few new situations to deal with. Some maps contain <a data-ref-id=\"3055-6\" href=\"/jet-pack/3055-6/\" slug=\"jet-pack\">jet packs</a>, which you can use to boost up into the air and float slowly back down to the ground. Jet packs are also outfitted with heavy machine guns with infinite ammo, making them effective if you want to just turn yourself into a mobile turret. Some maps also contain <a data-ref-id=\"3055-21\" href=\"/mech/3055-21/\" slug=\"mech\">mechs</a>, which players can get in and pilot. As you might expect, the mechs are a little bulky, but they dish out a ton of damage and can withstand a lot, as well. Both of these things turn up in the single-player campaign for a bit, but are more interesting in multiplayer situations. <br/><br/> The game looks great, with tons of action going on in the backgrounds and skies above you as you make your way through the game. The multiplayer maps also look great, with some locations coming from portions of the campaign. The \"British Space Nazi\" motif of the Helghast continues unabated with lots of insidious-sounding characters, not the least of which is <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17965\" href=\"/jorhan-stahl/3005-17965/\" slug=\"jorhan-stahl\">Jorhan Stahl</a>, one of the bad guys in the campaign. He's voiced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-7702\" href=\"/malcolm-mcdowell/3040-7702/\" slug=\"malcolm-mcdowell\">Malcolm McDowell</a>, who does a really great job. The ISA side of things has some good voice work, too, including <a data-ref-id=\"3040-99926\" href=\"/james-remar/3040-99926/\" slug=\"james-remar\">James Remar</a> as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17998\" href=\"/jason-narville/3005-17998/\" slug=\"jason-narville\">Captain Narville</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-26353\" href=\"/andrew-bowen/3040-26353/\" slug=\"andrew-bowen\">Andrew Bowen</a> as Sevchenko. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1713047-k16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1713047\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1713047-k16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1713047\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101494/1713047-k16.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101494/1713047-k16.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Stahl's as evil as it gets. You should probably make sure he's dead, if you can.</figcaption></figure>         Killzone 3 also stands out as one of the first <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a> games to support both the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4669\" href=\"/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/\" slug=\"playstation-move-support\">PlayStation Move</a> and 3D televisions. Both are, of course, totally optional, and I've found that neither really adds that much to the game. The game replicates a lot of the aim-and-shoot functionality of the right side of the DualShock 3 with a Move wand, requiring you to hold the left half of a regular controller or use the Navigation Controller to move around. Some snappier lock-on targeting makes the game easier to play with a Move, but I found myself longing for the standard controller, which works great, by the way. While I'm sure someone will come along and prove me wrong someday, it's hard to imagine players with Move controllers competing against people with standard gamepads. Or, at least, I got totally slaughtered. I also didn't find myself doing too well in multiplayer mode when 3D was turned on, either. Like other 3D games, I found it difficult to focus on any one thing, making it hard to line up targets or make out some of the UI elements. The game also got darker and the text got significantly blurrier when playing in 3D, and I had a lot of problems with the 3D simply ceasing to function, causing me to see double for long stretches of time. I'm tempted to blame this on my specific setup, but it's probably worth noting that I haven't had that problem with any of the other 3D content I've viewed on this equipment. It's neat when it works, but it feels like a novelty... a novelty that left me feeling pretty queasy after 20 minutes of use. As is the case with all of this stuff, <i>your mileage may vary</i>. <br/><br/> It's great that Killzone 3 supports all of the additional features of the PlayStation 3, though when it comes down to it, I had the most fun with it when I was playing it with a standard controller in two measly dimensions. But a lot of the design is so familiar that it's hard to get as excited for Killzone 3 as you might have last time around. Killzone 2 felt like a landmark event that finally gave the PlayStation 3 a world-class first-person shooter that you couldn't play anywhere else. After two years, Killzone 3 hasn't changed enough to reignite all of those feelings, but it's still a thrilling ride when you're alone and a well-designed multiplayer experience, as well.    ", "deck": "Killzone 3 delivers an experience that's a little too similar to its predecessor in spots, but it still has plenty explosive moments to see both online and off.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-364/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30431/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/killzone-3/3030-30431/", "id": 30431, "name": "Killzone 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-02-21 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-100850/", "id": 100850, "name": "Killzone 3"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/bulletstorm-review/1900-365/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/123089/1693183-bulletstorm_core_video_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1693183\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"580\" style=\"width: 580px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/123089/1693183-bulletstorm_core_video_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1693183\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/123089/1693183-bulletstorm_core_video_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Grayson sounds a lot like Wolverine and sort of looks like him, too. </figcaption></figure>         In some weird alternate universe, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-2\" href=\"/john-romero/3040-2/\" slug=\"john-romero\">John Romero</a> is still a part of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-347\" href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" slug=\"id-software\">id Software</a> and every first-person shooter out there is filled with new iterations on the old \"riding the rocket\" or \"sucking it down\" death messages found in the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8015\" href=\"/quake/3030-8015/\" slug=\"quake\">Quake</a>. Games went in a different direction in that universe, eschewing the petty grasps at realism found here in our dimension in favor of seeking out new--but still <i>totally</i> juvenile--ways to tell someone that they suck. On top of that, they're all finding bigger ways to blow things up and new ways to have guns rip polygonal bodies apart, often while making as many \"edgy\" references to <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1000\" href=\"/satan/3005-1000/\" slug=\"satan\">Satan</a> as they possibly can. In that universe, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30088\" href=\"/bulletstorm/3030-30088/\" slug=\"bulletstorm\">Bulletstorm</a> gets two stars for being too colorful, wholly repetitive, and a shameless bite of the ideas found in the Grudgehumper series, namely Grudgehumper VI: The Devil's Warehouse. Back here in the real world, however, Bulletstorm is a refreshing shooter that challenges you to do more than just hide behind a burning car and shoot soldiers in the face. <br/><br/> Bulletstorm is the next game from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-730\" href=\"/people-can-fly/3010-730/\" slug=\"people-can-fly\">People Can Fly</a>, the people that brought you a gun that shoots <i>both</i> exploding ninja stars <i>and</i> lightning, which should give you a pretty good idea about where their head is at. That gun comes from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6730\" href=\"/painkiller/3030-6730/\" slug=\"painkiller\">Painkiller</a>, and you can see some of the studio's past in portions of Bulletstorm. But there's also a distinctly \"Hollywood blockbuster\" edge to everything, courtesy of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-149\" href=\"/epic-games/3010-149/\" slug=\"epic-games\">Epic Games</a>, which bought the Polish developer back in 2007. In some ways, this game feels like a reaction to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War</a>, which some folks like to slag off as being too gray, too self-serious, and too repetitive. By comparison, Bulletstorm contains a bright, colorful world with a great amount of variety. It's hardly serious, and the way the points system is implemented all but begs you to switch things up as often as possible, which prevents the game from feeling like a one-note affair. Not every aspect of the game hits every single time out, but it's more than solid enough to stand out as something fresh and exciting. <br/><br/> You might not get any of that feeling from the game's opening hour, though, as Bulletstorm starts quite slowly. As <a data-ref-id=\"3005-14733\" href=\"/grayson-hunt/3005-14733/\" slug=\"grayson-hunt\">Grayson Hunt</a>, leader of an ex-military hit squad that wants revenge against the maniacal general that sent Hunt's team out to kill innocent people, you'll start out with an assault rifle and not much else. The tutorial sequence eventually introduces you to your melee abilities, which include a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2\" href=\"/sub-zero/3005-2/\" slug=\"sub-zero\">Sub-Zero</a>-like slide and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-656\" href=\"/duke-nukem/3005-656/\" slug=\"duke-nukem\">Duke Nukem</a> big boot, both of which will knock an enemy into the air and slow them down, giving you the opportunity to gun them down while they're floating away. You'll also get an energy leash that can be used to pull enemies in, setting them up for a kick or more gunfire. The leash and your foot are also the main ways you interact with the environment, mainly by leashing things down to fill gaps or kicking objects that are blocking your path. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1691921-new_demo_flare_3_1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1691921\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56284760845384\" data-width=\"899\" style=\"width: 899px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1691921-new_demo_flare_3_1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1691921\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1691921-new_demo_flare_3_1024x576.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The pistol can also shoot explosive flares.</figcaption></figure>         Before too long, you're introduced to the game's skillshot system, and this is where the game starts to come together. By killing enemies in specific ways, you'll earn points that can be spent on weapon upgrades and ammo. Some of these are as simple as shooting a guy in the head. Others require more setup, like using the leash's secondary ability to thump a group of enemies up into the air, shooting some other enemies that are still on the ground, and looking up to shoot the still-suspended bad guys afterwards. Or shooting a guy in his crotch, then running up and kicking him after he drops to his knees in agony. Or killing two guys with one bullet. The list goes on and on, so much so that the game gives you a separate menu for all of the skillshots so you can see how many of the 131 different tasks you've completed. The tasks are broken up by weapon, giving you new things to try each time you acquire one of the game's seven guns. This is the thing about Bulletstorm that requires you to play it differently than the average shooter... or at least you'll want to play it that way, because playing it like a standard shooter makes it a pretty boring game. If you're the sort of guy that likes to hoard ammo in case there's a big boss fight around the corner, you'll need to get past that and get into the idea of shooting off as much of your stuff as often as possible, because that's the way to keep the higher-scoring kills coming in. This, in turn, lets you get additional abilities and ammo for your guns, which gives you new skillshots to try, and so on. <br/><br/> Of course, all of this would be for nothing if the guns themselves weren't any good. Thankfully, weird future guns with multiple firing modes just happens to be People Can Fly's specialty, and the game delivers with things like the Flail Gun, which shoots out two grenades strapped together with a chain. You can take heads off with the chain itself, or wrap the grenades around enemies or other objects to set up some fun explosions. So, for example, you can wrap a flail around a garbage can, kick it at a group of enemies, and then manually trigger the explosion to take them all out. If you want, you can even wrap up one of your AI-controlled partners and hit the explosion when they're getting swarmed. Then there's the Boneduster, a four-barreled <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotgun</a> that will blast enemies in half if you hit them up close. Or the Penetrator, which fires a large, spinning drill bit that carries enemies away when you hit them, nailing them to the wall where the drill spins them around for few seconds. The weapons all also have secondary fire modes, giving you another layer of things to play with, though the secondary fires require their own ammo, rather than draining from your pool of primary ammo. In some cases, this will make you want to make sure those shots count, since they aren't as easy to come by. <br/><br/> The play in Bulletstorm is fast, even though you can slow down individual enemies with a boot or leash. The game keeps up a pretty frenetic pace once you start fighting, though it'll break up the action with quiet spots, giving you time to find a resupply point or exchange some dialogue to advance the story. Considering that you're usually trying to kill enemies in specific ways to score points, you might think that the speed would start to work against it. The game gets around this by making most of the AI fairly basic. Guys with melee weapons rush at you in a pretty straight line. Other enemies will take cover, but they're just as likely to pop out and stand there while you gun them down. The minibosses, which are armed with chainguns or other heavier weaponry, plod around and don't turn very fast, giving you plenty of time to outflank them. This doesn't make Bulletstorm completely simple, but the challenge comes from knowing just how far to push it and just how long to stay out in the open to nail some heavy skillshots before hanging back to let your health recharge. Overall, it feels pretty well-balanced, though I found myself wishing for some kind of sandbox sort of mode with no ammo constraints, just to have more time to play around with the various skillshot techniques. That said, I still managed to complete over 75 percent of the skillshots by the time I made it through the campaign. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1403628-vf_e32010_bulletstorm_demo_1500_082.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403628\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1403628-vf_e32010_bulletstorm_demo_1500_082.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403628\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1403628-vf_e32010_bulletstorm_demo_1500_082.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1403628-vf_e32010_bulletstorm_demo_1500_082.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Kicking guys into electricity is pretty effective.</figcaption></figure>         Bulletstorm's script is ridiculous and curse-filled, and the recurring gag is that they like to insert the cursing into sentences where it doesn't make any immediate sense. So when you first meet up with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17366\" href=\"/trishka-novak/3005-17366/\" slug=\"trishka-novak\">Trishka</a>, she threatens to \"kill your dick.\" Later on, the general you're trying to murder starts calling your Asian associate \"Sushi-dick.\" They talk about \"getting all murdery.\" Out of context like this, it's going to sound awful, like the exact kind of forced attitude that ensures that the mainstream audience views games as power fantasies for the developmentally arrested. But you know what? In context, it's layered on so thick and at such odd times that it actually works pretty well. The script takes some time here and there to sort of wink and nod at you as if to say \"yeah, we know, that doesn't make any sense at all\" or \"we're going to have the guy get offended at the racist remark because we know that obviously is <i>way</i> uncool.\" Your personal taste is going to dictate how much dick-tit you can handle, but after rolling my eyes at the writing for the first couple of hours, I started to get into it.<br/><br/> The nature of the story is probably what saves it from feeling like it's trying too hard. Over the course the game, Grayson goes from a drunken space pirate to the idiot that realizes he's doomed his entire crew to something approaching respectable. And it's interesting to watch as your partners grow together and grow apart over the course of the story. It's not some huge story with deep fiction and it's not going to spawn any novels, but for a game that's trying to get by on the number of ways which you can kill someone, it's surprising that the story is even cohesive to begin with. <br/><br/> In addition to the campaign, Bulletstorm has a single-player scoreboard-based mode called Echoes, which takes small segments from the campaign and breaks them out into mini-levels. The goal is to finish them quickly while scoring as many points as possible. You'll earn stars and hit an online leaderboard once you're finished. These are pretty good little chunks of action, but it's disappointing that so many of them are ripped right out of the single-player. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1475574-bulletstorm_gc_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1475574\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11660/1475574-bulletstorm_gc_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1475574\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1475574-bulletstorm_gc_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11660/1475574-bulletstorm_gc_2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Trishka, like most AI partners, tends to let you do most of the work.</figcaption></figure>         The game does have an online multiplayer component, but it's limited to a four-player <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3567\" href=\"/survival-mode/3015-3567/\" slug=\"survival-mode\">wave-based survival mode</a> called Anarchy. The spin this puts on the Gears-style Horde mode is that each level has a points threshold that must be met in order to proceed. So you can't just jump in there and lazily shoot enemies to move ahead. You'll need to work together to perform team skillshots, too, like yanking an enemy back and forth with multiple leashes or having one guy kick someone while the other follows up with bullets. Between rounds, you can spend your points on additional weapons and upgrades. Since this mode requires actual cooperation, it's best enjoyed with friends or motivated strangers who want to communicate about when to kick, shoot, or leash on those team skillshots. As you play, you earn experience points that unlock cosmetic upgrades for your armor and weapons. <br/><br/> The console versions of the game perform as you'd probably expect for a modern <a data-ref-id=\"3015-86\" href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" slug=\"unreal-engine-3\">Unreal Engine</a> game, but it feels like extra care has gone into giving the game a bright color palette. The environments throughout Bulletstorm are great, with majestic backgrounds and nice lighting both indoors and out. The PC version of the game, as you'd probably expect, is capable of looking much better than the console versions. It's a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2452\" href=\"/games-for-windows-live/3015-2452/\" slug=\"games-for-windows-live\">Games For Windows Live</a> game on PC with its own separate set of achievements and full support for gamepads. With a mouse, you'll probably want to fiddle with the settings a bit, since it feels a little odd out of the box and maps controls in a way that makes perfect sense if you've played it with a gamepad before, but might not be the most intuitive thing for people who never venture off the PC. <br/><br/> After being really down on Bulletstorm for the first couple of hours, I was pleasantly shocked to see how well it started coming together once I started getting better at using the different weapons and once the story started moving at a faster pace. While it's easy to see spots where the game could have been more fully featured or offered more unique areas instead of repurposing campaign spots, it's a solid new entry that truly offers an alternative to the standard sci-fi or military-themed first-person shooter.    ", "deck": "Bulletstorm presents a thrilling alternative to today's first-person shooters.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-365/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30088/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bulletstorm/3030-30088/", "id": 30088, "name": "Bulletstorm"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-02-23 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-91517/", "id": 91517, "name": "Bulletstorm"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/homefront-review/1900-366/", "description": "<p style=\"\">There is a moment in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26633\" href=\"/homefront/3030-26633/\" slug=\"homefront\">             Homefront's</a> single-player campaign that sums up the whole shebang in its entirety.

You stumble upon a group of Korean soldiers dutifully shoveling corpses into a mass grave. This is, of course, awful. Dramatic, sad music swells, and one of your compatriots begins to tremble angrily, and as his temper builds, he finally cracks, pulling his rifle and shooting blindly at any soldier he sees.

It is endless buildup toward horror and shock, constantly kneecapped by the developer's unwillingness to make good on its threats of emotional impact. Its \"terrifyingly plausible\" tale of an America overrun by a newly powerful unified Korean regime seems like the stuff of paranoid nightmare, the kind of story that certainly could make for a troubling, intense video game experience. Instead, developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6120\" href=\"/kaos-studios/3010-6120/\" slug=\"kaos-studios\">            Kaos Studios</a> plays it safe, out and out refusing every opportunity to explore its own narrative and instead resting entirely on a series of dully standard shooting missions, periodically punctuated by scenes of terrible things happening to characters you've developed zero attachment to. Were that action of a more visceral and exciting quality, and not merely a generally easy, periodically frustrating, and largely uninspired copy of every other modern shooter of the era--with one particularly <i>modern</i> game of <i>warfare</i> among them--you might be able to forgive Homefront's disinterest in storytelling. Instead, excitement often eludes the game, and were it not for a small handful of genuinely interesting setpiece battles and a decent multiplayer suite, Homefront would be completely dismissible. <br/><br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1044953-homefront06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044953\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1044953-homefront06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044953\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1044953-homefront06.jpg\"></a><figcaption> At some point, this dude will refuse to get out of your way.</figcaption></figure>         Homefront's story puts you in the role of a faceless, voiceless protagonist named Jacobs, a former pilot who finds himself rousted from his bed and shoved onto a makeshift prison bus by cruel and murderous Korean soldiers. It's the year 2027, and the United States is little more than a shell of its former self. An opening preamble combines real life footage of Hillary Clinton discussing the South Korean military boat sunk by the North with manufactured news footage featuring the rise of Kim Jong-Un as North Korea's new great leader, his reunification of the two Koreas and outward expansion into Japan and other vulnerable Asian nations, and eventual attack on America via an EMP weapon. This leads to an invasion of America's West Coast and irradiating of the Mississippi River, to keep American forces in the east separated from the armies in the west. All of this in just 17 years, and now you're on a bus headed to God knows where, while you watch innocent civilians--parents, in front of their children, even--gunned down by faceless soldiers of an invading enemy. <br/> <br/>And then you go shoot some dudes.  <br/> <br/>After a daring rescue attempt by resistance fighters, you're whisked away, handed a gun, and told to just start firing away. While that makes some sense in the beginning, Homefront never breaks from this pattern of showing you something horrible (usually from a very safe distance) and then hurrying you off into a standard bout of duck-and-shoot firefighting. There are feeble attempts at emotional resonance, but for as much time as you spend with the characters in your squad of freedom fighters and seeing innocents beaten, bludgeoned, and shot to death, shockingly little impression is made. Characters appear and disappear frequently, making one wonder if the whole resistance is made up of like five actual people and some random extras. Flirtations with infighting--including tensions involving your Korean-American team member, and a sequence where a fellow fighter botches a launch of white phosphorus that kills as many friendlies as foes--are set-up and then cast aside. Opportunities for extrapolation, exploration, real <i>emotion</i> are constantly tossed away in favor of rote gunplay. Other, better shooters have found ways to marry their story and their action in creative ways. In Homefront, action and drama feel completely divorced from one another.<br/><br/>It's a shame, given the supposed involvement of writer <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/john-milius/14-485565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">         John Milius</a>, who co-wrote <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/apocalypse-now/16-180768/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>Apocalypse Now</i></a> and both wrote and directed the Cold War paranoia cult classic <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/red-dawn/16-173032/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>Red Dawn</i></a>. Who better than he to plug into the fear inherent to American culture of a sadistic invading army stepping foot on US soil? Who better to flesh out these characters, or at least give them some cheesily memorable personality? Either Milius' involvement is grossly overstated, or the guy has just lost his touch. At no point do you get any sense of gravity or reality in this story, nor do you get the kind of rah-rah, everyman vs. an evil army vibe so prevalent in <i>Red Dawn</i>. That movie certainly lacked realism, but it's chock full of standout lines and significant characters. Milius knows how to write dialogue. This is the guy who wrote the \"<a href=\"http://movieclips.com/PWhqF-jaws-movie-the-indianapolis-speech/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indianapolis</a>\" speech from <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/jaws/16-168657/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>Jaws</i></a>, and the \"<a href=\"http://movieclips.com/asrW-dirty-harry-movie-do-you-feel-lucky-punk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Do you feel lucky?</a>\" monologue from <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/dirty-harry/16-194774/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>Dirty Harry</i></a>. The most memorable lines from Homefront? A <a data-ref-id=\"3040-19049\" href=\"/bruce-campbell/3040-19049/\" slug=\"bruce-campbell\">   Bruce Campbell </a>reference, a Korean barbecue crack about some burning enemy soldiers (which really feels like it should have been followed by a sad trombone for maximum impact), and the time someone on my squad shouted about enemies occupying a Hooters. <br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1399126-960374_20100611_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1399126\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1399126-960374_20100611_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1399126\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1399126-960374_20100611_screen004.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Suffice it to say, this did not go entirely according to plan.</figcaption></figure>         That the action fails to pick up the story's slack is Homefront's greatest disappointment. We're used to games failing to deliver on their cinematic storytelling goals, but given the inroads made by developers in first-person shooting over the last few years, it's shocking how underwhelming much of Homefront's action truly is. Indeed, there are moments that impress. While the game is plagued by a dingy, often indistinguishable color-palette and crusty, blurry textures (which make the game's pervasively janky frame rate all the more confusing), Kaos Studios has managed to craft some appropriately decrepit and heartbreaking scenery to fight through--ruined, blood-soaked suburbs and an artillery-laden Golden Gate Bridge are particular standouts--and as you fight through them, the battlefields are rife with explosions, ambient gunfire, and a kind of controlled chaos; the kind you can trudge through without feeling like the shaky-cam and constant waves of enemies are throwing off your equilibrium. <br/><br/>On the flipside, few moments in Homefront feel truly dangerous. There is a constantly guided feel to the game's progression, not to mention a distinct lack of challenge. A few particularly intense firefights will lead to repeated death, but on the normal difficulty level, most missions are a breeze (the hardest level is an improvement, but not exactly gut-wrenching.) Most of this breezy feel is the result of the game's definition of \"squad tactics.\" You're nearly always accompanied by a few other resistance fighters, and most times you're just following them around to wherever it is they decide to go. These cohorts aren't crack shots, but they're also invincible, meaning you can often just use them as temporary bullet shields, and following them will always result in you finding the best cover spots. <br/><br/>As much as that aids the game's ease of play, it also adds some frustration. That your AI compatriots take cover at all feels a bit like a cruel joke, since they can't get hurt. Ostensibly they're supposed to be real soldiers like you, so of course they'd want to use tactics to avoid getting shot. But then they take the best cover spots, and refuse to move out of your way while you're running around getting pelted by enemy fire. And while following your friends around makes for a bit of a brainless progression, periodic bouts of AI weirdness sometimes trap you in one spot. There are random moments where they just refuse to move for periods of time--the longest of which ended up being about half a minute--until some inexplicable trigger happens that makes them realize, \"Oh, right, war is happening. Time to go!\" Perhaps this is the developer's way of trying to pad out the campaign's disturbingly brief run time, which ends up being somewhere around four to five hours on the default difficulty. <br/><br/>Despite <a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" slug=\"thq\">          THQ's</a> blitzkrieg promotion of Homefront's single-player story, the multiplayer is where it feels like most of the developmental effort went. Maybe the publisher was frightened of getting crushed by the all-absorbing multiplayer <i>Akira</i> monster that is <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">           Call of Duty</a>, and perhaps with good reason. If you are a developer making a first-person shooter with a modern-ish setting and the usual slate of modes, it takes a Herculean effort to pull players away from the great time burglars of the genre. Homefront's effort isn't quite Herculean, but it's a good try.<br/><br/>Modes are all team-based, with a standard team deathmatch, and a ground control mode, where your team captures specific points on a given map. Battle Commander is a mode that alternates between these two match types, and also tosses in the benefit of an AI commander for both teams, which assigns special mission objectives and highlights players with particularly high kill streaks as threats. Meeting those objectives and killing off targeted players earns you bonus points.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1044949-homefront02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044949\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1044949-homefront02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044949\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1044949-homefront02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1044949-homefront02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fighting through the suburbs is a neat idea--it just never delivers the promised impact.</figcaption></figure>         Battle points are the game's currency, but they're spent in an unusual way. When you choose your class at the beginning of a match or right before a respawn, you see a number of other weapons, drones and other gadgetry that your class has unique access to. These objects can be purchased on the fly during the course of a game. So, say an enemy has jumped into a humvee and is coming barreling at your heavy weapons-class soldier. Now might be a good time to spend a few points and bust out a rocket launcher. Vehicles also cost points, so if you're particularly interested in flying a helicopter or driving a tank right over some unsuspecting players, it's best to save up your points. <br/><br/>The feel of the multiplayer is solid. It's fast-paced without feeling too arcadey, and the vehicles are easy to use and fun to control. The variety in classes occasionally lacks definition--the difference between a sniper and a heavy weapons fighter are obvious; others less so--but nearly all are fun to play with. There aren't a ton of maps, though one can probably expect more via DLC at some juncture--an all-too-obvious Alcatraz map, perhaps? The Xbox 360 DLC store is already replete with stuff, including such Avatar-focused gems as the Kim Jong-Il suit and glasses (each sold separately). Maybe it's just me, but that feels dangerously close to the territory of downloadable <a data-ref-id=\"3005-38\" href=\"/adolf-hitler/3005-38/\" slug=\"adolf-hitler\">Hitler</a> mustaches and Gaddafi robes.<br/><br/>Whether or not you decide to pick up Homefront should rely entirely on how much you want to play its multiplayer. It's not quite exciting or remarkable enough to trump the current giants of online dude-shooting, but it's a solidly crafted mode made comparatively impressive by just how tremendously mediocre the game's single-player campaign proves to be. Kaos obviously had ideas for this game, yet seemingly couldn't bring any of those ideas to total fruition.

Though you still can't play for real money, it offers most of the features you'd expect from an online poker client. It also serves as a spiritual successor, of sorts, to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25031\" href=\"/1-vs-100/3030-25031/\" slug=\"1-vs-100\">1 Vs. 100</a> by adding in some scheduled events that let you go up against a lot of different players at once. The AI isn't terrific, but if you're looking to play some online poker and aren't interested in the tons of free or real gambling options for this available on a PC, Full House serves it up quite well.<br/><br/> The big problem with video game poker is that when there are no real stakes to the gambling, people play like idiots. They go all-in with nothing over and over again, essentially griefing the game. Full House Poker attempts to get past this by giving you an online bankroll and requiring buy-ins for the bigger tournaments. This means that you sort of have to slum it in the low-level games or at least put in a chunk of offline time against the AI before you can get into some more meaningful action.<br/><br/> Some of the game's nicer features will seem like old hat to anyone that's been playing online poker for any length of time, but it's still great that Full House Poker lets you preload your actions. So if there are five players acting before you, and you already know you want to go all-in, you can just set that action and it will automatically occur when it's your turn to play. In cases where the circumstances have changed--if the players before you have bet or raised before it's your turn, your preset action is canceled, so it always does exactly what you want it to do. Again, the gambling sites have had this feature for a good, long time. But if you're only familiar with downloadable 360 poker games, this is a great addition.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1676367-fhp5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676367\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1676367-fhp5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676367\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1676367-fhp5.png\"></a><figcaption> You can take on the game's poker pros, each of which has a different AI profile.</figcaption></figure>Xbox 360 avatars are used in some interesting ways. You can perform chip trick animations at the table, and if you hold down a trigger while setting your action, you can put some theatrics into it. So if you want to timidly raise, you can. If you want to be splashy as you're pushing all of your chips into the middle, you can do that, too. In practice, it doesn't seem like people use this feature all that often, since most of them take longer than the neutral animation. Of course, there are achievements tied to using those animations, but you can bust most of those out in your first game, if you're so inclined.<br/><br/> In addition to the basic ranked and unranked multiplayer, you can also join \"Texas Heat\" events. These are scheduled 30-minute games that pit everyone against one another in a timed race to see who can gain the most experience points before the 30 minutes is up. You gain XP for intelligent play as well as for winning hands, so if you make the right call and fold a hand that would have lost or get out of a hand without spending any chips, you'll get a bit of an experience bump. It's an interesting way to make poker tournaments--which can be long and drawn out if you get a ton of participants--fit into a half-hour. The experience points you earn unlock additional clothing and animations, and also let you into higher-stakes multiplayer games. It's worth noting that the game launched with some nasty online issues that prevented some players from getting into online games, but most of that seems to have been ironed out by now.<br/><br/> You can also play alone, which is decent enough. The AI seems to have a few different styles, and you can't just push them out of every hand like you can with some weaker poker games. Still, this is only really interesting if you're a poker novice that's looking to pick up the basics before getting online. You can just slap together tables full of AI opponents or take on the AI one-on-one in a \"pro showdown.\"<br/><br/> Ten dollars is kind of a lot to ask for online poker when there are tons of gambling sites and Facebook apps offering similar, free alternatives on home computers.

It's a game that's being released simultaneously on PC and consoles, shaking the folks that still think of the first game as a benchmark for technical graphics in modern video games. It loses the jungle setting for <a data-ref-id=\"3035-109\" href=\"/new-york-city/3035-109/\" slug=\"new-york-city\">New York City</a> and it ditches Koreans entirely, instead focusing more on the aliens that were widely thought to have been the weak part of the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11757\" href=\"/crysis/3030-11757/\" slug=\"crysis\">Crysis</a>. It also carries a heavier focus on multiplayer, with options and character progression that lift directly from the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> style that's become so popular over the last few years. If I had to guess, I'd say that there will be some Crysis purists that won't be able to come to terms with Crysis 2, and that's a real shame, because it takes some interesting turns along the way that help set it apart from the typical multiplayer shooter that seems to get released every few months.<br/> <br/>     There's a lot going on in Crysis 2's campaign, which takes the action into New York City. You begin the game as a normal US Marine named Alcatraz, who is deployed via sub to help out <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1882\" href=\"/prophet/3005-1882/\" slug=\"prophet\">Prophet</a>, the nanosuited team leader from the previous game. The sub insertion goes completely off the rails before the opening credits roll, and without getting too into the specifics, you quickly find yourself in a nanosuit of your own with the initial mission of extracting a doctor with vital research that will hopefully help stop the invasion of squid-like aliens that's currently tearing the city apart and infesting its inhabitants with spores. Along the way, much of the tension comes from a struggle between the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2241\" href=\"/united-states-marine-corps/3015-2241/\" slug=\"united-states-marine-corps\">Marines</a> that seem to be there primarily to get as many uninfected civilians out of there as possible and a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3535\" href=\"/private-military-company/3015-3535/\" slug=\"private-military-company\">PMC</a> called CELL, which seems almost singularly focused on taking you down. Then there's a further struggle inside of CELL between the head of the PMC's military arm that wants to murder you (to be fair, you <i>do</i> spend a large part of the game mowing down his men as if they were paper dolls) and the intelligence-focused special advisor who wants to obey the PMC's largest shareholder's demands to bring you back alive. The political intrigue isn't especially entertaining, and a lot of the drama emanates from watching or hearing about these bureaucrats and businessmen as they bicker with each other about the best way to handle the ongoing invasion.<br/> <br/>     That's not to say that the story is completely empty, but it means that the story doesn't start to reveal interesting things about the true state of things in this universe until the game is nearly complete, and even then, it isn't the easiest thing in the world to follow. Also, you should probably know that the game doesn't set up these characters or factions very well at all, and many of them are either key figures or directly related to key figures from the first Crysis... which didn't exactly have the most cohesive or interesting story in the world, either. Considering the way Crysis 2 leans on its past and the fact that console-only players haven't had a chance to play a Crysis game yet, it's surprising that there isn't some sort of \"the story so far\" introduction to help bring players up to speed on what Crysis is all about. But even if you remember what went down back on the Lingshan Islands, the plot of Crysis 2 isn't its strongest suit. <br/> <br/>     Unsurprisingly, Crysis 2's strongest suit is its suit. The powered armor you wear while playing the game grants you abilities that make you much more powerful than the average Marine. Alcatraz's suit is easy to use with its streamlined functions. You use the shoulder buttons on the controller to turn on either maximum armor or a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4507\" href=\"/predator/3015-4507/\" slug=\"predator\">Predator</a>-style cloak. Neither mode is perfect and they only last until your suit energy runs out, at which point you'd be wise to take cover for a few seconds and let your power recharge. Armor lets you turn your current energy level into additional health, which will absorb the first few bullets, giving you more time to return fire. The cloak turns Crysis 2 into a stealth game. Since it doesn't make you completely invisible, enemies will still spot you if they get up close and look directly at you. So it's best to turn on the cloak, get behind a lone enemy, and stick him with your blade. But moving around drains energy faster than sitting still, so you'll usually need to find safe spots every 30 to 60 seconds to decloak and recover power before recloaking and moving forward. Also, any sort of gunfire or grenade tossing totally drains your energy and decloaks you, giving you an incentive to manually decloak (or perhaps switch over to armor mode) just before opening fire. The game is surprisingly good at making both abilities feel powerful without completely breaking the game, and the larger enemies you face later on, though not all that fun to fight, at least give you some targets that can't just be wiped out with one stealth melee attack. <br/> <br/>     In addition to turning on these two powers, there are also additional moves you can perform, each with their own energy cost. Running, for example, drains your meter. So does holding down the jump button, which gives you a power jump, or holding your breath while aiming down the sights of a sniper rifle. You can also power-up melee attacks to kick over portable toilets, and so on. There's also a visor mode that gives you a tactical assessment of the surrounding area. The game actually actively recommends that you pop into the visor every time you stumble onto a camp or other open, enemy-filled area. These are the parts that are most reminiscent of the previous Crysis, and you can tag enemies to get a constant view of where they are at any given time, making them easier to sneak up on. The game also highlights points of tactical interest, like spots to reload, good spots to snipe from, ledges that can be climbed, and so on. In a way, highlighting these points of interest feels like a bit much, like it's telling you the three different ways to approach any given situation. In practice, I mostly got into stabbing guys or, once that became repetitive, just cloaking and slipping past the entire encounter without firing a shot. Though you'll have to stop and recharge your energy pretty often through the beginning of the game, an upgrade system removes a lot of the game's stealth-based tension.<br/> <br/>     When you bring down aliens, a currency pops out of them that you can spend on suit upgrades. There are four sets of upgrades with three upgrades each, and you can only enable one upgrade per set. These do things like give you an air stomp, permitting crushing airborne attacks. But the most useful ones I selected made the suit's energy recharge more quickly and drain more slowly in stealth mode. With these on, you can hide for much longer, making it a lot easier to completely skip encounters, if that's your thing. Of course, you can't really run through these areas, so taking the slow approach to alien murdering got my playtime up to around eight hours on the default difficulty setting. If you take a more direct approach, I suspect that number could drop by a third or more. As in the previous games, weapons can be modified with different attachments, allowing you to add silencers, underbarrel shotguns, laser sights, and other items to your guns. Also, it might please you to know that any suit or weapon upgrades you unlock stick with you in subsequent playthroughs, so if you want to to tackle the hardest setting, you can lighten the load a bit by unlocking all of that stuff first on an easier difficulty. <br/> <br/>     The design of Crysis 2's campaign gives you the opportunity to play around with your enemies, if you like, but the game also has its tight corridor moments. At times, the levels feel like they're jerking back and forth between the small hallways and funnels of a Call of Duty game and the open areas of the first Crysis. It can make the action feel a bit disjointed.<br/> <br/>     Taking the nanosuit into an online match is surprisingly thrilling. Maybe I'm just surprised because the series' previous attempt was a dud, but Crysis 2's multiplayer effectively marries the power of your suit to the standard modes and styles of the recent Call of Duty games. You'll play modes like team deathmatch, capture the flag, and capture-and-hold variants, but a lot of it is freshened up by the ability to slap on your extra armor at the first sight or trouble or stalk around with your cloak running, hoping that it works on human players as well as it does against the AI (it doesn't). You'll also enable perks that fit into each of the three suit states, letting you don more powerful armor when your armor mode is enabled, giving you that same air stomp, settling down the recoil on your weapons, and so on. Also, the game handles the unlocking of those items in a smart way by breaking the experience points that you earn up across the armor, stealth and power (which is their name for the default state). As you level up stealth and complete challenges related to your currently equipped stealth perk, you'll earn bonuses and unlock more stealth options. Same deal for the other two modes. <br/> <br/>     The game also has killstreak bonuses in the classic form, granting you a support power like \"maximum radar\" for staying alive while downing the enemy repeatedly. The catch is that your kills only count toward that streak if you collect the dog tags that fall out of the enemies you kill. You can't steal other dog tags--they only appear when you get the kill--but it means you have to get out there and risk your neck to get those bonuses, by default. If you're a sniper that needs to stay out of the fray, or if you're far too lazy to retrieve those tags, one of the later perks you can unlock automatically collects tags for you. It's an interesting twist on the normal way first-person shooters are being built these days. Weapon attachments are unlocked in a similar way. <br/> <br/>     Speaking of unlocking, the big downside of Crysis 2's multiplayer is that it's very slow to open up to you. On one hand, it's probably for the best that you don't get into any of the teamwork-focused objective modes until you've spent a lot of time getting used to the way the suit works in simple team deathmatch games, but it'll still take hours before you get access to every ranked playlist. If you're playing with friends, you can always set up a private game and do whatever you like.<br/> <br/>     When Crysis was first released, it was one of those graphical wonders that could only be done on the PC--but not <i>your</i> PC. As time went on and more powerful parts became more widely available, running Crysis on its highest settings became trivial... but it was still pretty cool to see. It was a showpiece, even if you didn't especially like the game built into all of those great-looking trees. The sequel has been simultaneously released on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. As of this writing, I've only seen it on the 360. It looks fine, for the most part, with an unsteady frame rate being its most damning visual issue. The game gets choppy in some cases, whether you're playing alone or online. The game's best visual trick is light bloom, which makes the indoor-to-outdoor transitions look nice, but the game also does this a few different times, with each subsequent use of the trick being less and less impressive. Also, it's easy to see the level of detail popping back and forth between low and high textures, and some objects, like bushes or small posts, completely disappear if you get far enough away from them. In a game with cloaking, where you're constantly watching for another player to decloak in front of you, the vanishing objects get a little more aggravating than it would be in most other games. But that definitely doesn't mean that Crysis 2 looks terrible. Artistically, it's really nice, with good-looking environments and decent, albeit repetitive enemies. The lighting and shadows are well-done, also. But if you're coming to Crysis 2 expecting Crytek to raise the bar and blow you away all over again, you might be disappointed with the way the console versions perform. <br/> <br/>     Crysis 2's main theme is great, but most of the other music is pretty forgettable. Actually, I found most of the game's audio to be a little lackluster. The weapons lack any real punch, and though your human enemies have a variety of things to say, the aliens repeatedly hiss at you in a way that gets old quickly. Also, a lot of the dialogue throughout the story is delivered with odd inflections and accents that don't always fit the world. It's not quite to the level of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21304\" href=\"/heavy-rain/3030-21304/\" slug=\"heavy-rain\">Heavy Rain</a>'s stilted delivery, but it stuck out in multiple spots. <br/> <br/>    Crysis 2 is dragged down a bit by a lot of relatively minor issues, but the suit really saves it, making the action a lot more entertaining than it would be otherwise. I only felt the need to spend time picking apart the graphics in this review because of what the first Crysis represents--I figure that it's pretty likely that you'll want to know how this game stacks up to the open-world and high-tech legacy of its predecessor. Direct comparisons might not be terribly favorable if you hold the first game in high regard, but when removed from that context, there are a lot of great moments in Crysis 2. The suit abilities are easy and powerful, giving you just enough variety to let you deal with encounters in multiple ways. And though you'll recognize large parts of its multiplayer design and gameplay from, well, every other shooter released over the last three years, the suit abilities add enough of a new wrinkle to make Crysis 2 stand out in an incredibly crowded field.", "deck": "It might not feel as special as its predecessor, but Crysis 2 is still a high-quality shooter, both alone or in multiplayer.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-368/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26754/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/crysis-2/3030-26754/", "id": 26754, "name": "Crysis 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-03-22 09:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-91908/", "id": 91908, "name": "Crysis 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/super-street-fighter-iv-review/1900-369/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1742514-image2010_1221_1506_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1742514\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"400\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1742514-image2010_1221_1506_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1742514\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/26/1742514-image2010_1221_1506_6.jpg\"></a><figcaption>   You can keep it classy in pro mode or assign supers and specials to the touch screen in lite mode.</figcaption></figure><span></span>    The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-117\" href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\">Nintendo 3DS</a> version of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28437\" href=\"/super-street-fighter-iv/3030-28437/\">Super Street Fighter IV</a> is a great portable version of a great fighting game. It also might be the most fully featured 3DS game available alongside the new handheld's launch, offering support for almost every major system-level item that the 3DS has to offer, like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6609\" href=\"/streetpass-functionality/3015-6609/\">StreetPass</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6752\" href=\"/play-coin-support/3015-6752/\">Play Coins</a>, and online support. And though none of them are as successful as a joystick and two rows of three buttons, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\">Capcom</a> has included a lot of different control options in an attempt to cater to a large number of players of varying skill levels. The catch there is that some of the control options make not-so-welcome changes to the way the game plays, potentially impacting the quality of the versus experience.<br /><br />       SSFIV on the Nintendo 3DS has almost all of the features found in the console versions of the game. There's a trial mode to let you bang out combos, you can set a player icon and title, you can fight through the arcade mode and get interrupted with online fight requests, and so on. Even the achievement system from the other versions make it over here via a custom list of medals that you can unlock. It has all 35 of the characters, and they even get a couple of the alternate costumes that required an extra purchase on the 360 and PS3. You can play through the arcade mode and get the same type of intro images and conclusions that you saw on consoles, and, well, you get the idea. The only missing features come on the online side, where you can match up against other players and fight them, but the tournament options and large lobbies found on consoles aren't here. <br /><br />       New features are also included, like 500 character figurines that you can unlock via a spinning wheel. Each of these figures has a level, number of hit points, and other statistics associated with them. It's your job to assemble a strong team of five figures, which make up your StreetPass team. Then, at least in theory, you just walk around your hometown with your 3DS in sleep mode, and whenever you encounter another player that's doing the same thing, you'll exchange team data and a completely passive battle will occur. When you launch the game, any StreetPass battles you've engaged in are posted to a log, and you'll earn additional figure points--which are used to purchase more figures--for winning those battles. You can also earn figure points by simply playing the game in any other mode, or you can exchange a Play Coin for one spin of the figure-unlocking wheel. It's a basic system, but it integrates quite nicely with the handheld's various passive features. <br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1742516-image2011_0216_1431_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1742516\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"400\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1742516-image2011_0216_1431_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1742516\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/26/1742516-image2011_0216_1431_5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>   There are 500 little figures to collect and use for StreetPass battles.</figcaption></figure><span></span>      Super Street Fighter IV is best played on a six-button controller, with all six buttons on the face of the device. The 3DS, by default, sets things up like they were on the Super Nintendo, with your hard punch and kick buttons on the shoulders. It's less than ideal, but usually works well enough. The game also puts four large buttons on the touch screen that can be assigned in a variety of ways. In the default \"lite\" control scheme, special moves are mapped to these buttons, so your super or ultra combo is always a button press away, as are two special moves. You can configure exactly what you want on those buttons, so if you'd rather have push-button access to all three speeds of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-103\" href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\">Ryu</a>'s fireball, that's an option, as well. The configuration is saved on a per-character basis, letting you set up each fighter just the way you like. You can also enable auto-blocking, which works as advertised. If someone throws an attack in your direction and you're not in the middle of attacking or recovering, you'll block it. The catch is that the damage is temporarily shown on your life meter, almost as if you absorbed the blow with a focus attack. The life slowly restores to your meter, but if you're hit with an actual attack, all of that potential energy is drained. This helps keep players honest and prevents the auto-blocking from getting too powerful. <br /><br />       In the pro control setting, you can only place multi-button combinations onto those touch screen buttons. By default it'll let you pull off a focus attack or push all three punch or kick buttons simultaneously. But the rest of the game plays as it did on consoles. You'll have to execute all of the moves on your own, something that isn't too tough to do with the system's D-pad, though my big left hand certainly cramped up a bit after putting some serious time in with the game. <br /><br />       The big control problem in the 3DS version of this game is that the lite mode breaks the rules of the game, allowing for balance-changing situations that would be impossible under normal circumstances. Specifically, charge moves--<a data-ref-id=\"3005-266\" href=\"/guile/3005-266/\">Guile</a>'s flash kick, for example--can be executed without them charging first. Without the need to hold down for a moment before rising up into a flash kick, Guile can follow his sonic boom projectile in and, if the other player decides to jump over the projectile, Guile can flash kick them right out of the air, no questions asked. This gets frustrating when you take the game online. <br /><br />       When you attempt to find an online opponent, the default option lets players with either control scheme intermingle, and you don't know ahead of time if the other player is using auto-block or which attacks they have mapped to the touch screen. But it's easy to tell once a fight has begun, as players flash whenever an auto-block is performed. I've played quite a bit of Street Fighter over the years, but the way moves can come up without being charged is forcing me to unlearn the rules of the game, something that'll probably make me worse at playing the game on consoles in the long run. And even though dismantling these players isn't all that hard once you know what to expect, it's just no fun to fight Guile after Guile, knowing that they just intend to execute standing flash kicks whenever possible. Now, you can filter your searches to ensure that you're only matched up with pro mode players, but in my experience, almost no one is playing that way. I found exactly one taker when searching specifically for pro mode players... and he quit after I beat him once. Frustrating. <br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1742517-image2011_0216_1514_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1742517\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"400\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1742517-image2011_0216_1514_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1742517\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/26/1742517-image2011_0216_1514_1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/26/1742517-image2011_0216_1514_1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>   The console version's achievement system comes over in the form of medals.</figcaption></figure><span></span>    Visually, SSFIV looks great and makes good use of the platform's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1204\" href=\"/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/\">3D</a> option. The backgrounds sink into the screen effectively, giving a great sense of depth while also not causing the same sort of swimmy stomach that some 3D games can. Of course, the impact of 3D on your constitution will vary, so if you don't want to deal with it at all, you can always disable it. While the backgrounds do look great, they're also completely static. All of that movement from the console versions of the game is gone, so the hippo won't walk up to you over the course of a match, and you can't dragon punch the wing off of that plane. Even without those animations, though, the game still looks great. In an attempt to emphasize the 3D capabilities of the display, Capcom has included a \"3D view\" option that gives you a sort of over-the-shoulder camera angle on the fight. In a game that places such value on knowing how much space is between you and the other fighter, playing around with the camera angle seems like a misguided feature that detracts from the experience. But it's optional and worth looking at once or twice, just to see how the 3D makes it all look. <br /><br />       Getting into online matches quickly and easily is probably Super Street Fighter IV's strongest component. It even seems to be faster and more reliable than its console counterparts, with none of the \"unable to join session\" errors that plague Capcom's other fighting games, but once a rush of domestic players get their hands on the system, it's anyone's guess about how that will change. It's just a bit disappointing that most of those online matches are slightly marred by the way the lite mode allows players to perform tasks that would be impossible under normal circumstances.

Totally going to die.</figcaption></figure>         The titular swarm you take control of is made up of tiny blue things, spewed forth in bunches of 50 by an <i>Alien </i>queen-like mother, who requires her brood to set forth across a harsh wasteland, collecting DNA strands to help her evolve into…something. The swarm is controlled as a single unit, which you can bunch up or spread out as needed, but which is always controlled via a single control stick. It's a blob of individual parts that can be shaped in a few different ways, depending on what obstacles are put forth in front of you. <br/><br/>Each DNA strand you collect goes toward building up your multiplier. Every stage comes stamped with a specific score that must be hit before you can progress (with the promise of high scores displayed on leaderboards for those who can master the multiplier), and achieving those scores requires careful, thoughtful navigation, and often sacrifice. Killing the members of your swarm isn't just an unfortunate circumstance, it's a necessity. Using the game's charge move to bust up boxes and enemies full of delicious DNA requires a payment of at least one swarm creature. Likewise, sometimes collecting difficult-to-reach troves of DNA means sending a few swarm guys to certain doom. Sometimes, you can even opt to keep your streak alive simply by making it a point to kill off some of your swarm.  <br/> <br/>Killing them actually earns you points toward your streak, but that's OK, because you can always get more. Respawn points are littered throughout each stage, and while they won't just regenerate new swarm members forever, the frequency with which you can regain swarmites quickly trains you to understand that their death is a noble sacrifice, not to be mourned, but to be celebrated. Sadly, that celebration is short-lived. Once you start progressing deeper into the game, what little joy one might extract from the mildly amusing deaths of the swarmites will be quickly replaced with enervating frustration. <br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1743075-swarm8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1743075\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1743075-swarm8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1743075\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/1743075-swarm8.jpg\"></a><figcaption> You can't make an omelet without breaking a few blue guys.</figcaption></figure>         Swarm is a game of blind progression. Traps and pitfalls are rarely telegraphed with much warning, leaving you to simply react. That would be fine, were the controls more actively responsive. One mechanic, where you have to stack the swarm members atop one another in a leaning tower of squishy blue, is all but useless. Gaining perspective on where you need to be to hit the tall thing you need to hit with your stacked swarm is difficult, given the game's static side-view camera angle, and even getting the swarm to stack is inconsistent, given the required button-mashing commands and the sluggish, awkward reactions of the swarm.  <br/> <br/>Even running away is a chore. You have to constantly dart forward using the dash mechanic, which requires you to hold down a trigger button, release and press another trigger button over and over to keep dashing forward. Alternately, you can use the speed jump (which replaces the second trigger with the jump button) but the result is the same. The swarmites, hard as they try, cannot always keep up with the flurries of commands you sometimes have to toss at them, resulting in accidental deaths. Yes, they are expendable, but oftentimes you don't want them to die, as you'll need larger numbers to activate switches that release higher volumes of DNA. <br/><br/>The end result is a game that is requires less brainpower and more hope and prayer for success. This is a game in which finding the end of the level is often less a blessing than a curse, as all too often you'll happen upon mother's awaiting tendril and realize you're thousands of points away from the clearing goal. This means that many stages will require multiple plays. Similarly, you'll repeat many of the same level sections again and again as you fly blindly into obnoxiously obfuscated traps. Occasional bouts with bosses do little to improve matters, and by the time you reach the game's final levels, you'll be crestfallen to realize that all that irritation you've endured was over the course of a relatively small handful of levels. You can get a solid several hours of play out of Swarm, but most of that will come from level repetition.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1743069-swarm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1743069\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1743069-swarm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1743069\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/1743069-swarm2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/1743069-swarm2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>That tentacle is either a sign of glorious victory, or soul-crushing defeat.</figcaption></figure>         Swarm also just isn't quite celebratory enough when it comes to its desire for death. If you're going to make a game about squishy-cute genocide, it makes logical sense that you'd want to make it as funny as possible. Hothead occasionally flirts with amusingly gratuitous violence, offering closeups of the last members of your herd being impaled, burned, electrocuted or suffocated right before you have to restart a level section. But more often, the death takes a backseat to the action on screen. It makes sense that the developer wouldn't want to break up the action with constant highlights of death, but even the moments where it does choose to spotlight the splatters of blue blood and swarm carcasses aren't especially funny or entertaining. There are the game's \"death medals\" which signify your progress in meeting certain death goals (\"progressive death medals\" and \"mega death medals\" are also included), and the game's title screen does let you kill a single swarm creature over and over in a variety of different ways. But beyond that, the game's brand of adorable sadism just isn't fetishistic enough to stand out. <br/><br/>And yet, for all its shortcomings, Swarm is a game that somehow inspires you to keep playing. Maybe it's just because its primary idea--treating your swarm like a herd of lambs to the slaughter all for the sake of keeping that multiplier high--is such a solid one. Even as the level designs seek to frustrate you beyond measure, the game remains strangely addictive. If this were simply a bad game, you'd give up and move onto something else. But something at the core of Swarm keeps you coming back, despite all reason to the contrary. Through gritted teeth and skyrocketing blood pressure, you keep playing those same levels again and again for reasons that cannot be, well, reasoned with. I don't know if I can call Swarm fun, but I don't think I can call it <i>not</i> fun, either.

If you were around for the releases of those hallowed old consoles, you probably remember Pilotwings as \"the thing you put in occasionally when you got tired of the new Mario game.\" But there's no <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1\" href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a> game, nor a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31776\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d/3030-31776/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d\">Zelda</a>, nor even the new <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31734\" href=\"/kid-icarus-uprising/3030-31734/\" slug=\"kid-icarus-uprising\">Kid Icarus</a> on shelves alongside the 3DS yet. On its own merits, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31748\" href=\"/pilotwings-resort/3030-31748/\" slug=\"pilotwings-resort\">Pilotwings Resort</a> is a reasonably fun, low-impact flight simulator to play in short bursts, and it's a good showcase for the fancy 3D effects in this new handheld. But taken as <i>the</i> marquee first-party title at the 3DS' launch, Pilotwings Resort feels like a pretty thin offering. <br/><br/> The game offers three modes of aerial transport--a biplane, a rocket belt, and a hang glider--for use in its various events. You'll go on to unlock suped-up versions of these vehicles as you complete more events that handle a little differently, but in terms of gameplay styles, those three categories are basically all you get. Most of the variety comes from Resort's five tiers of objective-based missions. In some of the more interesting levels, you'll be tasked with taking photos of specific landmarks as you sail around on the glider, shooting at balloons released by a speedboat below you, or collecting a group of wayward little UFOs and returning them to their mothership hovering offshore. The flight physics and core controls feel tight but relatively forgiving, and make a great case for the precision and usability of the new analog circle pad on the 3DS. I wish there were more examples of these clever objectives, but it feels like the bulk of the missions focuses on more basic activities like flying through rings, flying through rings quickly, and, uh, flying through rings upside down. <br/><br/> Despite some repetition in the mission design, Pilotwings Resort is a good diversion when you want to flip your 3DS open and just play something for 10 minutes. But it's over too fast; there's just not a lot of meat to sink your teeth into. Each successive tier of missions requires you to earn a certain number of stars in the previous one before you can unlock it, but even with that requirement, I got through all of tiered the missions in a couple of hours. There's also a free flight mode where you collect various trinkets and do stunts as you explore the island, but this mode doesn't feel particularly \"free,\" since it's initially limited to only two-minute bursts of flight time. You can unlock longer sessions, different times of day, and a model viewer by collecting more items, but that stuff doesn't provide much lasting value since you're still flying around the same small landmass over and over. Then you can view your stats. Then you've seen just about all there is to see in Pilotwings Resort. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90267/1683502-2132427428_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1683502\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1731601731602\" data-width=\"462\" style=\"width: 462px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90267/1683502-2132427428_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1683502\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90267/1683502-2132427428_full.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The rocket belt provides the most control of all your flight options.</figcaption></figure>         Nintendo has done a good job bringing Pilotwings up to speed with the look and feel of its other Mii-ridden first-party fare. The game takes place on Wuhu Island, the same tropical getaway that made games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21098\" href=\"/wii-sports-resort/3030-21098/\" slug=\"wii-sports-resort\">Wii Sports Resort</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26869\" href=\"/wii-fit-plus/3030-26869/\" slug=\"wii-fit-plus\">Wii Fit Plus</a> feel so festive, and of course your system-level 3DS Mii appears front and center to pilot all of the game's aircraft. Pilotwings Resort doesn't offer a mindblowing level of graphical fidelity--its rendition of Wuhu Island looks qualitatively pretty similar to what you've seen on the Wii--but flying around its lighthouses, bridges, and rocky outcroppings gives you a good chance to mess around with the 3DS' sense of depth. Personally, I found Pilotwings' sweet spot to be with the 3D just barely enabled, providing just a subtle touch of depth without feeling overwhelming. Pushing the 3D slider much past the quarter-full point made it really hard for me to focus and resulted in the image appearing to split in two, but the 3D looked great at that lower level. As with every 3DS game, your experience will likely vary from game to game, and from person to person. <br/><br/>On its own merits, Pilotwings Resort offers lighthearted flight action that's fun enough while it lasts, but it just doesn't last very long. As if the brevity of the mission lineup weren't enough, there's no support for StreetPass or the 3DS' other nifty system-level features that would have let you further explore all the cool stuff your new handheld can do. Given the 3DS' relatively meager launch lineup, Pilotwings Resort is worth having in the early adopter's collection as a technical showpiece and an occasional distraction, but without a stronger Nintendo game to distract you <i>from</i>, the experience is fleeting.", "deck": "Nintendo's latest fanciful flight sim is fun enough for a few minutes at a time, but won't provide you much lasting value.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-371/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31748/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pilotwings-resort/3030-31748/", "id": 31748, "name": "Pilotwings Resort"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-03-25 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101625/", "id": 101625, "name": "Pilotwings Resort"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/ridge-racer-3d-review/1900-372/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1744323-rrc_sq20110104_145742.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1744323\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1744323-rrc_sq20110104_145742.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1744323\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1744323-rrc_sq20110104_145742.jpg\"></a><figcaption> A lot of the textures and logos on the cars look a little grimy.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31741\" href=\"/ridge-racer-3d/3030-31741/\" slug=\"ridge-racer-3d\">Ridge Racer 3D</a> continues the long-running trend of ensuring that a game in <a data-ref-id=\"3010-382\" href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/\" slug=\"namco-bandai-games-inc\">Namco</a>'s long-running driving series is present at the launch of any viable gaming platform. The launch of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" slug=\"psp\">PSP</a> added nitrous oxide boosts to the series, something that has carried forward into the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-396\" href=\"/ridge-racer/3025-396/\" slug=\"ridge-racer\">Ridge</a> games released in its wake. Now, on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-117\" href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" slug=\"nintendo-3ds\">Nintendo 3DS</a>, the developers have added a new \"one-button drift\" feature that could open up the series to players who might not have been able to figure out Ridge Racer's arcane and specific drifting techniques. That's kind of a neat idea, but between its 1990s design aesthetic and its reused assets, Ridge Racer 3D is a game that only dedicated fans of the series are likely to appreciate.<br/><br/> The primary way to progress through Ridge Racer 3D is its Grand Prix mode, which presents you with a collection of events, each with its own set of races. It's pretty standard, and as you work your way through, you'll unlock new cars and advance into new categories, which gives you a faster class of cars to choose from. There are a lot of events in the Grand Prix mode, but it isn't supported by enough tracks to make working your way through the events interesting. By the second or third event, the game is already throwing tracks that you've already raced on into the mix. In fact, the game opens with the track from the very first Ridge Racer game, an inclusion that you'll either take as terrific nostalgia or a sign that the game is way too derivative, since this isn't the first time that the franchise has relied on old tracks in new games. The races go up to eight cars in all, which is a lower number than the series has handled in the past, even on portable platforms.<br/><br/> In addition to the Grand Prix, you can set up single races, time attacks, and other one-off events, though most of these don't give you any points, which is the currency you'll use to unlock additional cars and nitrous upgrades. Considering how many times you'll be repeating the same tracks in the standard Grand Prix, setting up even more races on those same tracks without getting anything for it seems like a waste of time unless you're really into setting lap times or if you're lucky enough to be near other Ridge Racer 3D players so you can exchange lap times and ghost data via the built-in <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6609\" href=\"/streetpass-functionality/3015-6609/\" slug=\"streetpass-functionality\">StreetPass</a> feature on the 3DS. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1744324-rrc_sq20110104_145634.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1744324\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1744324-rrc_sq20110104_145634.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1744324\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1744324-rrc_sq20110104_145634.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Hey! A snowman!</figcaption></figure>         By default, the control in Ridge Racer 3D hasn't changed a bit. The cars break down into different drift types, each of which impacts how dramatically a car will behave when you willfully lose traction to slide around turns. The dynamic drift type typically comes with the highest top speeds, making it worthwhile to learn how to carefully nudge the car around turns. It still doesn't feel anything like driving a real car, but that's hardly the point. If the default drift system is too much for you to wrap your head around, there's a new \"one-button drift\" option that makes the game even easier. In this mode, your car won't lose traction unless you hold down the drift button, and as soon as you left off the button, your car magically regains traction. So it almost becomes a \"hard turn\" button that lets you take sharper corners than you can by using the standard steering controls. A quick tap is usually all it takes to whip around a corner with little loss of speed. <br/><br/> The new drift button sort of takes the skill out of playing Ridge Racer, but I don't know that it makes the concepts behind Ridge Racer's driving model any easier to understand. If you haven't already experienced the series, but have been playing a lot of other driving games over the years, I imagine that the game will feel like it was designed by folks who have never driven an actual car. But if you can eradicate any desire for realism from your head, taking the corners in a Ridge Racer game is still pretty entertaining, if only to see how hard you can push cars into the turn and still come out unscathed. Let's call it an acquired taste that's only become tougher to acquire as the driving genre has grown in popularity and diversity over the past 16 years.<br/><br/> The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1204\" href=\"/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/\" slug=\"stereoscopic-3d\">3D</a> effect in Ridge Racer 3D can be a bit extreme. I had no trouble playing it in the first-person view, but when you play from the default behind-the-car perspective, I found that the car sticks out a bit too much, making it hard to focus on the turns ahead. I solved this problem by turning the 3D down to around the halfway mark, but this is more of a personal taste thing, so you'll probably have a different experience. The game's frame rate isn't as smooth as it has been in past Ridge Racer releases, but it's stable and conveys a decent sense of speed. <br/><br/> If playing a new Ridge Racer game at the launch of every platform has become part of your routine, Ridge Racer 3D fills a security blanket-like role of letting you know that Namco is still making Ridge Racer games the same way its been making them since nitrous was added back at the launch of the PSP. But if you expect forward movement and new ideas from sequels, it's hard not to look at Ridge Racer 3D as a stubborn relic from a bygone era.", "deck": "Ridge Racer 3D adds a couple of new features to the same tracks, cars, and ideas that have been driving the series since 2005, if not earlier.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-372/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31741/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ridge-racer-3d/3030-31741/", "id": 31741, "name": "Ridge Racer 3D"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-03-26 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-109229/", "id": 109229, "name": "Ridge Racer 3D"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wwe-all-stars-review/1900-373/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1408101-wwe_allstars_screenshot7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1408101\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1408101-wwe_allstars_screenshot7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1408101\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/1408101-wwe_allstars_screenshot7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The bigger moves send you flying high above the canvas. </figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31641\" href=\"/wwe-all-stars/3030-31641/\" slug=\"wwe-all-stars\">WWE All Stars</a> doesn't concern itself with reality--not even the fictionalized \"reality\" that drives professional wrestling. Instead, it feels like the developers set out to make a wrestling game that was, above all, exciting to play. Common rules of wrestling, like the count-out, are thrown aside. Boring tag team matches are tossed out in favor of rulesets that put all four men in the ring at the same time. And the physics of striking and grappling have been exaggerated to the point where the game has mid-air juggle combos, made possible by wrestlers that bounce off of the mat like they were wrestling on a trampoline. It's an exciting game that's entertaining in a way that no wrestling game has been for a generation or more. And it's all backed up by a great roster of current and past <a data-ref-id=\"3025-130\" href=\"/wwe/3025-130/\" slug=\"wwe\">WWE</a> performers, letting you relive a few classic moments while also letting you put together matches that wouldn't be possible today. <br/><br/> All Stars is not a particularly complicated game, and the key to doing well is learning the range and timing of your various moves. There are quick and strong versions of your strikes and grapple attempts, so knowing when to wind up for a strong grapple and when to quickly insert some strikes to prevent your opponent's grapple attempts from connecting is the key to victory. Unlike many other wrestling games, this one doesn't mess around with <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\" href=\"/stamina-bar/3015-3569/\" slug=\"stamina-bar\">stamina</a>. Instead, your focus should be on damaging your opponent while avoiding damage yourself, sort of like a fighting game. As you wrestle, you'll build up multiple meters, one that lets you execute signature maneuvers that drop the game into a glorious slow-motion sequence as you dish out substantial damage and a second meter that's used for your even-more-devastating finishing moves. They aren't especially tough to execute, so the strategy comes in knowing when to pull out these moves, which take even more time to wind up than your standard attacks. The fighting system lets you combo moves together in some interesting ways, allowing for mid-air juggles, but you can also grab guys out of mid-air, setting up some chain grapples that look really awesome. <br/><br/> That's probably the thing that makes WWE All Stars work so well. It's easy to make your wrestlers do cool stuff, and the game is great at making your moves look insane and painful. Simple atomic drops shake the entire ring. Finishers, like the Rock Bottom, almost look like they're going to destroy it. And a lot of the basic animations for signature moves have been pumped up. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-614\" href=\"/cm-punk/3005-614/\" slug=\"cm-punk\">CM Punk</a> tosses opponents up into the air before raising his knee and catching them with the Go To Sleep. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-247\" href=\"/hulk-hogan/3005-247/\" slug=\"hulk-hogan\">Hulk Hogan</a>'s leg drop can hit standing opponents, crumpling them to the ground in a heap. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-472\" href=\"/randy-savage/3005-472/\" slug=\"randy-savage\">Randy Savage</a> backflips from wherever he's standing to the closest turnbuckle when you activate his elbow drop finisher. The whole thing just looks crazy, and this makes the few cases where wrestlers clip through each other or don't quite line up right for some animations easier to swallow. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/1705294-wweallstars_ortonentrance.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1705294\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/1705294-wweallstars_ortonentrance.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1705294\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9446/1705294-wweallstars_ortonentrance.jpg\"></a><figcaption>He'll punt you in the head, but that's not going to end the match.</figcaption></figure>         The game defaults to a standard exhibition match, which is actually closer to a \"falls count anywhere\" match. You won't get counted out, there's no rope break, and the only way to lose by disqualification is to pull a chair out from under the ring and give your opponent four or five good shots. If you want to be able to dole out more chair shots, the extreme rules variant removes even this stipulation. The tag matches are all \"tornado\" tag team matches, eliminating the notion of tagging in and out completely by letting all four men be in the ring at once. You can also get into elimination or handicap matches, and many of the multiplayer modes allow up to four players in the ring at once. There's also a cage match, which lets you dive off of the cage for attacks and presents a timing-based minigame that must be completed before a wrestler can climb out of the cage and win. Also, many matches can be won by knockout, which is handled really well. <br/><br/> The idea is simple: if you hit a guy with your finisher while he's out of health, he's knocked out and you win the match. The knock out is usually followed by a stylish, lazy pin, with one wrestler standing on the other, or pinning him with one finger. It's a simple idea that makes the finishing moves feel more dangerous and damaging than they do in most traditional wrestling games. The catch is that it also ends tag matches, even though the unconscious guy's partner should, in theory, be able to break up that lazy pin and carry on the fight. Instead the standing partner just slinks out of the ring while the pin takes place. <br/><br/> You can also take the game online, which mirrors the mode selection found in the offline game, but Internet latency can really change the pace of the action. In games where lag is noticeable, quick strikes become far more effective, because timing your button presses to counter them is even more difficult when you have to deal with a less-than-idea Internet connection. Since all players seem to be handicapped in the same way when the connection isn't great, it doesn't seem to break the game, but it certainly makes some strategies more viable than others. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/1705303-wweallstars_hoganbigshowstandoff.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1705303\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/1705303-wweallstars_hoganbigshowstandoff.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1705303\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9446/1705303-wweallstars_hoganbigshowstandoff.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9446/1705303-wweallstars_hoganbigshowstandoff.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Not quite the NWO showdown you were probably hoping for.</figcaption></figure>         Though you can set up any of the game's matches as exhibition bouts, WWE All Stars does a great job with its story-style mode. The Path of Champions is a set of three ten-fight ladders that let you take anyone on the roster (or any two characters, in the case of the tag team path) on a road to a championship fight. One of these is against <a data-ref-id=\"3005-473\" href=\"/the-undertaker/3005-473/\" slug=\"the-undertaker\">The Undertaker</a>, another puts you up against <a data-ref-id=\"3005-602\" href=\"/randy-orton/3005-602/\" slug=\"randy-orton\">Randy Orton</a>, and the last has you going against both members of D-Generation X. From a gameplay perspective, this mode is just a selection of preset matches. But the game sprinkles in a few really nice pre-rendered cutscenes to give the journey a little flavor. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-577\" href=\"/paul-bearer/3005-577/\" slug=\"paul-bearer\">Paul Bearer</a> appears in The Undertaker path, moaning into a microphone and animating perfectly while the Dead Man silently planes a wooden coffin in the background. Randy Orton's isn't quite as entertaining, but the pre-rendered Randy gets a lot of Orton's real-life looks and turns to the camera down really well. You can tell that someone sat down and studied a lot of footage for these. The D-Generation X cutscenes are silly in the way you'd expect: at one point <a data-ref-id=\"3005-469\" href=\"/triple-h/3005-469/\" slug=\"triple-h\">Triple H</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-597\" href=\"/shawn-michaels/3005-597/\" slug=\"shawn-michaels\">Shawn Michaels</a> simply start shilling for the game you're currently playing. This is all real voicework, and most of it's pretty good. <br/><br/> The other mode is called Fantasy Warfare, and it tries to match up the two sides of the game's roster in interesting ways. Some of them work better than others. For example, it makes sense to have CM Punk and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-581\" href=\"/steve-austin/3005-581/\" slug=\"steve-austin\">\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin</a> face off in a \"Superior Lifestyle\" showdown to see if straight edge is better than drinking a lot of beer. \"Coldest Snake\" for a match between <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9328\" href=\"/jake-roberts/3005-9328/\" slug=\"jake-roberts\">Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts</a> and \"The Viper\" Randy Orton? Again, perfect. But pitting Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka against <a data-ref-id=\"3005-572\" href=\"/kane/3005-572/\" slug=\"kane\">Kane</a> to determine who has the most \"Ruthless Aggression\" is kind of forced. Even if the core idea of the match isn't always great, each of these 15 pairings is set up with a terrific video package that really reminds you that the best thing about the WWE these days is its team of video editors. Lots of great footage from the past and the present is included and cut together really well. <br/> <br/>In addition to a great roster of 30 wrestlers (15 current, 15 \"legends,\"), you can also create your own wrestler. While there are some decent visual options for dressing your guys up, the move options are limited to the movesets of the existing characters. So you can make some crazy idiot in a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6219\" href=\"/bruce-lee/3005-6219/\" slug=\"bruce-lee\">Bruce Lee</a> <i>Game of Death</i> suit and make him wear <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11915\" href=\"/cobra-commander/3005-11915/\" slug=\"cobra-commander\">Cobra Commander</a>'s cowl, but he'll still play exactly like one of the existing characters. That said, you can separately assign movesets and finishers, so if there's a character you like to use but wish he had a different finisher, that's an option. Created wrestlers can, of course, be taken online. That said, with guys like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3324\" href=\"/mr-perfect/3005-3324/\" slug=\"mr-perfect\">Mr. Perfect</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4011\" href=\"/andre-the-giant/3005-4011/\" slug=\"andre-the-giant\">Andre the Giant</a> on the roster, you might not find a good reason to create a character of your own.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/1701055-wweallstars_hoganalt_hollywood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1701055\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/1701055-wweallstars_hoganalt_hollywood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1701055\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9446/1701055-wweallstars_hoganalt_hollywood.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9446/1701055-wweallstars_hoganalt_hollywood.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alternate outfits let you get a bit closer to the Hollywood days.</figcaption></figure>         Visually, the bulked-up wrestlers look like ridiculous action figure versions of themselves, but that doesn't mean that they're slow. The game moves really quickly, and strings its animations together pretty well. Perhaps the only downfall with the way the game looks lies in the wrestlers' dead-eyed faces, which don't animate very much over the course of a fight. So <a data-ref-id=\"3005-566\" href=\"/edge/3005-566/\" slug=\"edge\">Edge</a> will perpetually have a weird, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11167\" href=\"/joker/3005-11167/\" slug=\"joker\">Joker</a>-like smirk on his face at all times, and Randy Savage will always have a zombie-like look whenever he stares back at his opponent after his signature move hits. The commentary is pretty disappointing, with <a data-ref-id=\"3040-59816\" href=\"/jerry-lawler/3040-59816/\" slug=\"jerry-lawler\">Jerry Lawler</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89857\" href=\"/jim-ross/3040-89857/\" slug=\"jim-ross\">Jim Ross</a> providing some of the flattest, most generic sports dialogue around. It's also really repetitive. It's probably the one aspect of WWE All Stars that is straight-up bad. If those guys get back into a booth to record commentary again, someone needs to get them a cup of coffee or set their faces on fire or find some other way to make them sound genuinely excited about the proceedings. <br/><br/> Probably the biggest complaint with WWE All Stars is that there isn't more of it. More characters, to set up more Fantasy Warfare match-ups and more story mode hijinks would make for a longer-lasting experience. But if you were dedicated to seeing all of the major solo stuff and unlock all of the characters, you could blast through all of that in a day. With that in mind, the action can get a little thin, especially once you've figured out the timing for most of the reversals and strikes. But even with that in mind, WWE All Stars is still a great wrestling game that takes things in a much-needed new direction, and hopefully THQ applies at least some of what its San Diego team has done to some of its other, stuffier WWE releases.    ", "deck": "WWE All Stars has the wrestlers you want performing their moves in the craziest ways imaginable, making for a fresh-feeling game that's a lot of fun to play.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-373/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31641/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wwe-all-stars/3030-31641/", "id": 31641, "name": "WWE All Stars"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-03-29 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-102580/", "id": 102580, "name": "WWE All Stars"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/madden-nfl-football-review/1900-374/", "description": "<p style=\"\">People play sports because of a certain competitive spirit imbued within them; a desire to play against the best and persevere.

You can't escape the misery of Madden on the 3DS.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In <a href=\"/madden-nfl-football-3ds/3030-34245/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34245\">Madden NFL Football</a> for the newly-released <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS</a> system, you cannot do this. This is a multiplayer-bereft game of video game football. The only witness to your theoretical digital gridiron glory will be mindless AI players, who frankly could not give a flip about how awesome that deep pass was, or how badly you smoked them on that killer interception. What awaits you is not the heat of intense competition, but the icy, soulless embrace of computer opponents who bend and react with all the humanity of a game of electric football. How pathetic is this? The <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a> version, which is less than a quarter of the cost of the version found on this new-fangled device, has multiplayer capabilities. Chew on that one, and tell me it isn't a little salty.</p><p style=\"\">Mind you, multiplayer is not the only thing missing from Madden NFL Football. For starters, there is the obvious year marking in the title, which seems to suggest that this is an iteration of Madden that exists outside of time as we perceive it. Considering what an insane regression this is from what players got to know on the DS of old, credence is lent to that theory. The game offers up 11-on-11 and 5-on-5 permutations of football. In the 5-on-5 game, you play to a score of 30, and the incongruous soundtrack plays incessantly over the action. Otherwise, there is little difference beyond fewer player models on the field. </p><p style=\"\">In either event, you can opt for quick matches against the computer, or play in the season mode. That's not a franchise mode, mind you. It's a season mode. You play a season. That's it. Feature wise, it's actually a little like the online franchise mode introduced to the console versions not terribly long ago. Except there are no other people playing besides yourself, and the computer is seemingly incapable of trades, because that's probably hard to program, or something.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That is the gamut of modes to run through. When you tire of playing through single season after single season, perhaps you can create your own metagame out of \"how many scoring exploits can I find in this game?\" Handheld versions of Madden have never been the shining beacons of quality of the franchise, but over the years, whatever short-straw-drawing developers EA happened to lock in a supply closet for the duration necessary to churn out the latest DS and PSP editions of the game clearly developed some kind of Stockholm Syndrome, and out of sympathy for their captors, began turning in progressively more playable--if not exactly impressive--handheld football games. Some included multiplayer, even.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1746799-madden2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1746799\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1746799-madden2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1746799\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/1746799-madden2.jpg\"></a><figcaption> In six months, when Madden NFL 12 is released, feel free to just set your old Madden cart on fire. It'll be cathartic.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While this Madden plays a generally functional game of football in some scenarios--specifically when tuned to the All Pro difficulty, and after half-an-hour or so spent fudging with the few available gameplay sliders--it's effectively broken outside of those specific scenarios. All Madden is, predictably, impossible, cheap, and annoying. The default Pro setting cannot be considered anything but an elaborate, jokey reference to <a href=\"/tecmo-bowl/3030-11229/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11229\">Tecmo Bowl</a>. Every running back capable of moderate speed can regularly punch in huge gains like the great, diagonal <a href=\"/bo-jackson/3040-91277/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-91277\">Bo Jackson</a>. On kick returns, the touchdowns you <i>don't </i>get are the anomaly. Run forward, then run sideways, then run forward again, and watch as opponents struggle mightily to catch up. I got 14 return touchdowns in a row before I finally found a kick returner slow enough to negate the exploit. He was a linebacker, by the way.</p><p style=\"\">But what of the 3D? Or, you know, the only possible remaining reason to buy this thing? It's OK. The primary functionality of the 3D is to take the UI overlays and make them stand out against the depth of the play field. So scores, game clock, and other display-related bric-a-brac are all up in your face, while the field remains mostly the same. There is a bit of visual depth to the field you wouldn't otherwise get, but its purpose is elusive. The on-field action does at least look reasonably decent, with player models receiving a bump in quality over previous DS iterations. It looks more like the old PSP games than anything else. Still, animations are as janky as ever, especially when two players happen to rub up against one another, and while it's admirable that EA was able to shoehorn the console versions' commentary track onto a 3DS cart, it also seems an entirely superfluous and mildly cruel inclusion, given the giant, gaping holes found elsewhere.</p><p style=\"\">Madden NFL Football on the 3DS is a senseless endeavor. Its sole purpose seems to be to exist as a Madden game on store shelves at a platform launch. It's a crass, vacant husk so lacking in personality or substance that it might as well just be called Football Video Game: IN 3D!!! It's the worst kind of opportunism at $40 a pop. The tragedy is that it will work. People will buy this, because it exists at the right moment. Perhaps EA will release the rest of this game--namely, the fun parts--as part of its next Madden suite. That would be little solace for those who purchased this dreck. They'll still be saddled with this worthless, untradeable lump sitting on their game shelf, like a benign inoperable tumor. </p>", "deck": "If ever there were a cautionary tale for the early adopter of new gaming technology, Madden NFL Football is it.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-374/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-34245/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/madden-nfl-football/3030-34245/", "id": 34245, "name": "Madden NFL Football"}, "score": 1, "publish_date": "2011-03-30 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-109253/", "id": 109253, "name": "Madden NFL Football"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-review/1900-375/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1760408-219.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1760408\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110502/1760408-219.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1760408\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/110502/1760408-219.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Raiden and Liu Kang stop to chat about hats and lightning and stuff.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25042\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>, the reboot-friendly title of the ninth core game in a franchise that spans nearly two decades, manages to contain something for just about every sort of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-7\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3025-7/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a> fan. If you're the type that just wants to see video game guys kill each other in gruesome and often-hilarious ways, MK has plenty of that. If you're interested in an approachable, well-designed fighting game that offers a variety of wild moves that are easy to execute but are tougher to work into timing-based combos, you're totally covered. And if you care about the lore of Mortal Kombat--bear with me here, I know how weird it is to talk about the story in a fighting game as a strong point--this game takes you through the early parts of the MK story, before it got too crazy and littered with more characters and realms than you could shake a loose spinal cord at. With its shockingly terrific solo components and a multiplayer offering that gives you plenty of options, Mortal Kombat might just be the most complete fighting game ever released. Oh, and yeah, it's a lot of fun to play, too. <br/><br/> The fighting style in Mortal Kombat builds upon the relatively recent past, with some of its ideas coming out of the previous release, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20449\" href=\"/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe/3030-20449/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe\">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</a>. But that game was still set in a 3D environment, allowing players to sidestep out of the way of incoming spears, fire, and ice projectiles. The new Mortal Kombat flattens the action back down to a 2D plane, just as it was in the original trilogy of arcade releases. This change makes an immediate impact on the action, returning the game to an in-your-face, offensive style, where the best way to stop your opponent from teleporting behind you with his fist out is often to just do it to him first. Projectiles are truly dangerous again, and the game feels a bit more active than its immediate predecessor did. <br/><br/> The game also returns to the uppercuts and sweeps found in the original trilogy. You can start combos with jump-in punches, juggle them up into the air, and do what you can to keep them there, delivering damage all the while. That's not to say that there's no defensive aspect to Mortal Kombat, as there's definitely value in turtling up, trying to poke, and baiting out someone's X-ray, a bone-crunching move that requires a full super meter to attempt. But at times it feels like the fights are best when two players are simply going for it at all times. It's a thrilling game with a lot of flashy moves and combos, many of which can be sussed out by newer players. The specials are easy to perform, and once you wrap your mind around the logic of getting someone into the air and keeping them there, figuring out the most damaging moves you can is half the fun (at least until someone does the math and tells you which combos, exactly, do the most damage). While it goes out of its way to recall some of the fighting mechanics popularized by <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3571\" href=\"/mortal-kombat-ii/3030-3571/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat-ii\">MKII</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1434\" href=\"/mortal-kombat-3/3030-1434/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat-3\">MK3</a>, the game doesn't play like some total throwback, either. Carefully considering when to use the moves that drain parts of your super meter and timing those juggles just right are both pretty key.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"center\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1746070-mk_ct1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1746070\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"0.83333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1746070-mk_ct1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1746070\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1992/1746070-mk_ct1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Johnny Cage, playing the minigame from Tapper... but with SKULLS.</figcaption></figure>         That style of fighting drives the entire game across all of its modes, but you can opt to play it in both a traditional one-on-one fight or in a two-on-two tag battle. The game actually lets up to four humans play at once, if you're interested in tag-teaming with a real person. The tag battles add some extra moves to the game, letting you call in your partner to perform quick special moves or tagging out in the middle of a combo with fast switches between fighters. Personally, I prefer the classic one-on-one style but tagging in and out makes for a fun variant.<br/><br/> Mortal Kombat probably contains the best collection of single-player elements of any fighting game, ever. Its largest piece is the story mode, a chapter-based tale that takes you from one playable character to the next as the events of Mortal Kombat's first three games unfold in an alternate timeline that allows the developers to change some pretty interesting things about the state of the Mortal Kombat universe. By the end, some characters are left in a completely different state than they were in the \"normal\" timeline, which is pretty cool. But the best part about the story is the way it's conveyed. The game seamlessly weaves from fight to cutscene and back again, loading the battles in the background as you watch the story scenes unfold. Each match even ends with a custom win quote specific to that situation. The flow of the story really sucks you in, and other than having to deal with some annoying boss AI near the end of each tournament (but especially at the very end), it's really outstanding. It's also pretty long, too, with over a dozen chapters that, if I'm counting, probably takes somewhere around seven or eight hours to finish, provided you aren't skipping cutscenes. In addition to the preset story mode, you can also take on an arcade ladder mode with each character, which gives you a quick batch of fights that culminate in character-specific endings. <br/><br/> The other big single-player mode is the Challenge Tower, which is a collection of 300 tasks that vary up the rules of the fighting in a lot of different ways. Some are simple changes, like tag battles where the tagged out partner recovers health, or fights that must be finished with a fatality in order to be completed, or endurance battles that have you outnumbered. But some of them get way crazier, like one where instead of using normal attacks, each button press launches one of your limbs at your enemy. The limbs grow back over time, giving you a steady stream of heads, arms, and legs to launch. Others have the whole world tilt from side to side as hits land, with the fighter on the \"low\" side of the screen taking steady damage. There are a lot of inventive twists on the standard MK fight in the Tower, though a few types repeat a little too frequently as you rise to the final battle. Some of the tasks even come with a bit of dialogue, some of which gets pretty silly, such as one that has Mileena trying to give a teddy bear as a gift, or another that has Shang Tsung and Shao Kahn fighting over a gurgling baby that sits in the background as you battle. It really keeps you guessing in the same way that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12411\" href=\"/soul-calibur/3030-12411/\" slug=\"soul-calibur\">Soul Calibur</a>'s similar Mission Mode did.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1746071-mk_ct2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1746071\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56491228070175\" data-width=\"570\" style=\"width: 570px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/1746071-mk_ct2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1746071\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/1746071-mk_ct2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/1746071-mk_ct2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Test Your Luck spins the reels and gives you random gameplay variants to keep you on your toes.</figcaption></figure>         The Challenge Tower and the story mode force you to play specific characters, giving you plenty of time to try out most of the 27 fighters and figure out which are your favorites. Being that the game is set during the first three games, the vast majority of the roster comes from that era, from the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15743\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">MK1</a> classics like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1\" href=\"/scorpion/3005-1/\" slug=\"scorpion\">Scorpion</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-188\" href=\"/liu-kang/3005-188/\" slug=\"liu-kang\">Liu Kang</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-216\" href=\"/kano/3005-216/\" slug=\"kano\">Kano</a> to the MK3 upstarts like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-218\" href=\"/kabal/3005-218/\" slug=\"kabal\">Kabal</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-399\" href=\"/nightwolf/3005-399/\" slug=\"nightwolf\">Nightwolf</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-198\" href=\"/kurtis-stryker/3005-198/\" slug=\"kurtis-stryker\">Stryker</a>. Each character gets at least two outfits and two <a data-ref-id=\"3015-10\" href=\"/fatality/3015-10/\" slug=\"fatality\">fatalities</a>. Those second outfits, methods to perform the second fatalities, and loads of concept art and music are unlocked via the \"krypt,\" which behaves much as it has in past MK games. There's only one type of coin this time around (as opposed to six), and sinking time into the story mode will earn you enough coins to unlock a lot of stuff. Like past games, most of the concept art isn't really worth dwelling on for very long, so versus screen \"kombat kodes,\" costumes, and fatality instructions are the most important things to get out of the krypt. <br/><br/> Online, the game plays mostly how it plays offline, provided the network conditions are just right. The structure of the online mode starts with the same sort of lobby system used in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, giving players a spot to swap text with one-another as challenges are passed around and battles are fought. If you don't want to mess around with chat rooms, the standard ranked and unranked options are also present. Both regular and tag battles can be played online, and a new mode called King of the Hill rounds things out pretty nicely. This is MK's take on the \"quarter match\" or \"endless battle\" mode, allowing up to eight players to join a room and spectate fights while they wait for their turn to take on the current winner. The loser of each fight goes to the back of the line. MK's take on the mode includes a visual lobby, of sorts, where avatars stand around and watch the battles. You can emote with your avatar using different button presses to express your joy or rage during a fight, or you can just hit the select button and make the fight take up the entire screen. After a fight, the spectators and the loser are asked to rate the match, which gives \"respect points\" to the winner. The avatar presentation is a cool way to present the concept, and there are even hidden emotes in there for players to figure out, proving that the team behind Mortal Kombat will stuff secret moves into just about anything they possibly can. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1410396-92_169_day3_stagedemo_mortal_kombat_061710_2000_073.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1410396\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1410396-92_169_day3_stagedemo_mortal_kombat_061710_2000_073.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1410396\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1410396-92_169_day3_stagedemo_mortal_kombat_061710_2000_073.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1410396-92_169_day3_stagedemo_mortal_kombat_061710_2000_073.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Reptile wants to see your insides.</figcaption></figure>         Visually, the game is a big step up from the last Mortal Kombat game, with far more detailed characters and backgrounds. If I had to guess, I'd say that locking down the perspective to a fixed 2D battle helps make this possible, and there's a great amount of detail to be found in the graphics. As in the previous game, the characters' costumes get torn up over the course of a battle, resulting in bloody scrapes and cuts in the sides of faces, ripped clothes and masks, and so on. It's a great effect that looks even cooler when the fighters are also covered in blood at the end of a fight. It's pretty extreme and, well, pretty funny, too. Maybe I just have a weird sense of humor.<div><br/> Though the look and feel of the game is roughly identical across platforms, the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a> version of Mortal Kombat offers some additional features that make it the better version of the two. Specifically, the PS3 version has support for 3D televisions and also has an additional character, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-645\" href=\"/kratos/3005-645/\" slug=\"kratos\">Kratos</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"3025-244\" href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" slug=\"god-of-war\">God of War</a>. The extra character and stage are nice, and Kratos has a pretty cool ending, but it probably isn't a make-or-break addition unless you're a huge fan of the God of War series. The game's 3D mode looks quite nice. I certainly found it easier to follow than the typical 3D first-person shooter, though that says more about the differences in presentation between the two genres than anything about the quality of any one game's 3D support.<br/> <br/> Mortal Kombat has a broad appeal that I think will work for players from a variety of skill levels. There's a passable tutorial in place to teach you the basics, but no one thing in the game is that tough to accomplish. The game gets tricky when you start to put all of those things together into combos, but by the time you're thinking about that, you'll probably be ready to handle it. As for top-level play, I'm not the guy to judge any fighting game from the \"is this game tournament-worthy?\" angle. But MK feels solid, with enough depth and guessing games in place to work, provided that it's as balanced as it feels after a week of solid play. But even if, for some reason, the competitive aspects of the game didn't work out, there's so much great single-player material in Mortal Kombat that it's still worthwhile even if you aren't looking to fight others.    <br/><br/><br/><br/></div>", "deck": "Mortal Kombat is fantastic fun whether you're looking to take on the world or if you just want to see the story unfold in an all-new way.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-375/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25042/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/", "id": 25042, "name": "Mortal Kombat"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2011-04-19 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-107171/", "id": 107171, "name": "Mortal Kombat"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/portal-2-review/1900-376/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1722033-20492_1200x675crop0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1722033\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1722033-20492_1200x675crop0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1722033\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1722033-20492_1200x675crop0.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Don't panic!

Even the original Portal was all but defined by its tight focus and limited scale; it just executed on all those elements with a consistent, almost preternatural level of ingenuity and humor.  <br/><br/> I use the somewhat dismissive \"just\" here because the challenges of following up something so inventive and so universally well-received are arguably greater than coming up with the core concept in the first place. The element of surprise was a significant factor in the impact of the original Portal, but going into Portal 2, you know how a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-50\" href=\"/aperture-science-handheld-portal-device/3055-50/\" slug=\"aperture-science-handheld-portal-device\">    portal gun</a> works, you know that Aperture Science is essentially a less diabolical, but equally irresponsible counterpart to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-293\" href=\"/half-life/3025-293/\" slug=\"half-life\">    Half-Life's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3015-485\" href=\"/black-mesa/3015-485/\" slug=\"black-mesa\">    Black Mesa</a>, and you know that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-722\" href=\"/glados/3005-722/\" slug=\"glados\">    GlaDOS</a> likes testing, but <i>loves</i> murder.  <br/><br/> With these known quantities in mind, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\" href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374/\" slug=\"valve-corporation\">    Valve</a> does about the smartest thing it can with a full-blown sequel to such an effectively minimalist package by tossing out many of the self-imposed restrictions of the original and largely ignoring the temptation to lean on lots of easy callbacks. What it lacks in the surprise punch the original packed, it makes up for with scope and scale, couching that now-familiar combination of deadpan humor and brain-boggling puzzles in a game that's significantly bigger and more robust in virtually every meaningful way, but without feeling any less dense.  <br/><br/></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1722042-20503_1200x750crop0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1722042\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1722042-20503_1200x750crop0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1722042\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1722042-20503_1200x750crop0.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Meet Wheatley. He means well enough!</figcaption></figure>         Since the apparent \"death\" of GlaDOS at the end of Portal, the Aperture Science Research Facility has gone to seed. After you're awoken from a hibernation chamber disguised as a cheap hotel room by a friendly, motormouthed AI called <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15839\" href=\"/wheatley/3005-15839/\" slug=\"wheatley\">    Wheatley</a>--voiced with a terrific nervous energy by British humorist <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98457\" href=\"/stephen-merchant/3040-98457/\" slug=\"stephen-merchant\">    Stephen Merchant</a>--it's not long before you're once again running a series of \"tests\" for a revived and coolly vengeful GlaDOS. It would be charitable to characterize GlaDOS as indignantly sociopathic, and her lust for punishing you for your past transgressions is riper than ever. <br/><br/> I'll avoid any specific plot points, but suffice it to say that your journey takes you far deeper into the bowels of the facility than the original game even hinted at. This journey also serves as an Aperture Science history lesson of sorts, providing a glimpse of the company's dated industrial aesthetics through the decades, and introducing you to company founder <a data-ref-id=\"3005-14249\" href=\"/cave-johnson/3005-14249/\" slug=\"cave-johnson\">    Cave Johnson</a>--another terrific performance, this time courtesy of perennial tough-talker and boss-man-type <a data-ref-id=\"3040-90198\" href=\"/jk-simmons/3040-90198/\" slug=\"jk-simmons\">    J.K. Simmons</a>--as well as the evolution of the company's absurd corporate culture that would eventually give birth to GlaDOS. <br/><br/> The visual style of Portal 2 seems to be in direct defiance of the tight, hermetic feel of the original, eschewing that singular aesthetic in favor of many shades of grimy, long-forgotten industrialism and cavernous spaces that hint at an almost deliberate carelessness. Everything is hastily built on top of everything else, which leads to environments that are haphazard, impossibly dense, and almost constantly in jeopardy on collapsing in on themselves. In fact, the game can be so propulsive that it's easy to blow right past lots of terrific, often funny set details. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1722041-20501_1200x675crop0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1722041\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1722041-20501_1200x675crop0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1722041\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1722041-20501_1200x675crop0.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1722041-20501_1200x675crop0.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> A brief glimpse into Aperture's dilapidated past.</figcaption></figure>         And the puzzles. Oh, the puzzles! Having already introduced the core tenets of how portals work in the first game, Portal 2 runs far more briskly through the fundamentals, and introduces a slew of previously abandoned Aperture compounds and technologies to help constantly re-complicate things for you. Like the original, though, Portal 2 smartly introduces each idea one at a time before requiring you to use them in concert. At a point it can be easy to lose sight of the fundamentals as you get caught up in all these new-fangled gels, laser-bending cubes, hard light bridges, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1836\" href=\"/tractor-beam/3055-1836/\" slug=\"tractor-beam\">    tractor beams</a>, and more. Don't forget! It's called <b>Portal 2</b> for a reason. <br/><br/> A certain amount of trial-and-error is a necessity in solving many of the puzzles as you boggle out which buttons activate which contraptions, and how you'll need to harness them to get to the other side. While a certain amount of crackerjack timing is key to solving some puzzles, brains almost always trump reflexes, and if you find yourself struggling with the controls--regardless of whether you're playing with a mouse and keyboard or a controller--you're probably doing it wrong.  <br/><br/> Being several times the length of its predecessor, with puzzles that are as hard, if not harder, pure mental fatigue can also be an issue in Portal 2. While the game is constantly luring you forward with the promise of new visual treats and consistently sardonic dialogue from the expert voice cast, a short break can mean the difference between sussing out the solution and turning your brain into a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3538\" href=\"/potato/3055-3538/\" slug=\"potato\">    potato</a>. <br/><br/> Once solved, the puzzles themselves offer little reason to revisit the single-player campaign--which, in some ways, ends much more climactically than the original--though I still found being able to focus more on the game's plentiful gags on my second time through to still be quite fulfilling. Additionally, there's an enlightening developer commentary track provided by key members of the team at Valve that can be absolutely fascinating in its own right. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1501262-portal_2_2010_09_03_10_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1501262\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1501262-portal_2_2010_09_03_10_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1501262\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1501262-portal_2_2010_09_03_10_02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1501262-portal_2_2010_09_03_10_02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Robots don't have to hug! But they sure like to.</figcaption></figure>         Portal 2 also sports an equally well-crafted co-op campaign, casting you as one half of a gangly, curiously likable robotic odd couple built by GlaDOS for the specific purpose of running through her diabolical test chambers. It's much less story-intensive than the single-player game, though having sets of portals with which to solve the puzzles, while also being fundamentally dependent on another player's puzzle-solving abilities, can unsurprisingly complicate things. This mode features a \"ping\" tool which allows you to better direct your partner, though I found voice communication to still be an absolute necessity. Frustration looms throughout Portal 2, though if you're not operating at the same speed as your partner, you don't know your partner well enough, or, God forbid, you know your partner too well, it seems more likely to rear its head during the co-op campaign. <br/><br/> Despite being so much bigger than the original, I actually felt a little melancholy once Portal 2 was over, simply because it's so rare to find a game this smart, this funny, and this rich with detail. It elevates Portal from an odd, memorable experiment to one of the most significant series in Valve's stable with a unique voice and an incredible level of quality that all developers should aspire to.", "deck": "Valve falls further down its own rabbit hole with this expansive sequel that retains the cynical heart of the original Portal, while blowing out the scale on virtually every aspect of the execution.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-376/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21662/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/portal-2/3030-21662/", "id": 21662, "name": "Portal 2"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2011-04-19 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-96873/", "id": 96873, "name": "Portal 2"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/outland-review/1900-378/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1500339\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1500339\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg\"></a><figcaption> There are a handful of really impressive bosses in here.</figcaption></figure>         Now that last year's ill-conceived top-down zombie shooter <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27866\" href=\"/dead-nation/3030-27866/\" slug=\"dead-nation\">Dead Nation</a> is fading into memory, Finnish developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2107\" href=\"/housemarque/3010-2107/\" slug=\"housemarque\">Housemarque</a> is back on the right track with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32552\" href=\"/outland/3030-32552/\" slug=\"outland\">Outland</a>, an eye-popping 2D platformer that owes equal debts to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-3\" href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\" slug=\"metroid\">Metroid</a> and--of all things--<a data-ref-id=\"3030-12069\" href=\"/ikaruga/3030-12069/\" slug=\"ikaruga\">Ikaruga</a>. That odd combination results in a tightly designed downloadable game bursting with demanding traversal, surprisingly deep combat, and lush visual design. You can't be a fan of 2D action games in 2011 and not give this game a look. <br/><br/> Outland stops short of rendering its entire playable area on one giant graph-paper map, but the game's five areas are loosely tied together by level exits and teleporters that feed you fairly smoothly from place to place. You don't quite get the feeling of continuous exploration that you'd want after playing games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26706\" href=\"/shadow-complex/3030-26706/\" slug=\"shadow-complex\">Shadow Complex</a> or the latter day <a data-ref-id=\"3025-86\" href=\"/castlevania/3025-86/\" slug=\"castlevania\">Castlevanias</a>, but it's close enough. Though Outland is more linear and requires much less backtracking than those games, there are still areas you won't be able to access till later on, when you've acquired abilities that let you slide under things, launch into the air, or bust down walls with a charged shot.  <br/><br/> The sword combat is more involved and thus more satisfying than you'd expect on first glance. In addition to a basic three-hit combo, you can slide into enemies to daze them or slash upward in an uppercut-like motion to pop them up into the air. You can incorporate all of those moves into a single attack on an enemy, sliding into them, popping them up in the air, then leaping up and finishing them off before they even have a chance to hit you. It's a ton of fun. Both the fighting and the platforming are snappy and fluid, allowing you to get around the levels and fight enemies with speed and grace. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500338-outland_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1500338\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500338-outland_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1500338\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19513/1500338-outland_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>      Navigating the lush environments is quick and easy.</figcaption></figure>         It's a good thing you've got such precision control, because nothing about Outland's action is more demanding than its central reliance on a red-and-blue contrast that governs how you interact with enemies, platforms, and masses and masses of colored bullets. (There's that Ikaruga connection.) You can change yourself from one color to the other in a split second, which is a good thing, because you have to do that <i>instantly, constantly, all the time</i> to get by. You can only damage enemies of the opposite color, but you can only absorb bullets and stand on platforms of like color, so you get into lots of creative situations where you'll be switching colors every second or two to keep up. Like the combat, it's greatly satisfying to flip your alignment rapidly to get through some of the tougher scenarios cleanly without taking damage. <br/><br/> The game ramps up the difficulty of these two-tone scenarios gradually--it's the better part of an hour before you can even assume both colors--but by the end of the game, you'll be looking at some downright grueling challenges that force you to navigate enormous clouds of mixed bullets while fighting enemies that change their own coloration randomly <i>and</i> will shock you if you hit them at the wrong time. Oh, and you're standing on platforms that disappear out from under you when you flip colors. For the most part, you'll get through these sections with patience or trial and error (or both), but some frustration is inherent in the later levels.  <br/><br/> As demanding as the action is, the game's presentation could be a little clearer. The camera tends to pull out to such a degree your character is sometimes only a few pixels high, making it tough to see exactly what's going on if you don't sit especially close to your TV. And someone made the needlessly confusing decision to have your character flicker blue and red when you get hit, which sometimes made me do a knee-jerk color change that made me get hit <i>again</i> before I realized that it was a bad idea to change color in the first place. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1775438-untitled_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1775438\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1775438-untitled_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1775438\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1775438-untitled_1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1775438-untitled_1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Beware this hell of bullets.</figcaption></figure>         I have no reservation calling Outland an absolutely beautiful game. Housemarque does a lot with a little here, employing a silhouetted art style similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30380\" href=\"/limbo/3030-30380/\" slug=\"limbo\">Limbo</a> but with <a data-ref-id=\"3025-258\" href=\"/tron/3025-258/\" slug=\"tron\">Tron</a>-like red, blue, and yellow highlights applied to the characters in mostly tribal patterns that make them stand out and help highlight the tremendous animation. The backgrounds look like spare watercolor paintings with a lot of gentle light blooming and copious parallax scrolling to give them detail and depth. The five major areas look significantly different, with motifs ranging from a lush green jungle to dank caverns and frigid, mountainous peaks. Every screen of this game makes a great argument for why 2D games still matter from an artistic standpoint. <br/><br/> Outland's main campaign will probably run you about six hours, the high quality of which more than justifies its $10 asking price, and there are collectibles, speed-run levels, and some decent two-player cooperative challenge rooms if you want to lengthen the experience. I suspect this game is going to fly a little under the radar with so many high-profile titles releasing lately, but even a passing interest in 2D action demands that you at least give Outland a look.    ", "deck": "Housemarque's latest download is bursting with uniquely challenging action and visual panache to spare.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-378/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3), Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32552/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/outland/3030-32552/", "id": 32552, "name": "Outland"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-05-04 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-109556/", "id": 109556, "name": "Outland"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/brink-review/1900-379/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1698163-586_brink_ifitbleeds.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1698163\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56143344709898\" data-width=\"586\" style=\"width: 586px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1698163-586_brink_ifitbleeds.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1698163\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97594/1698163-586_brink_ifitbleeds.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to customize your character's look with items that unlock as you play.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26694\" href=\"/brink/3030-26694/\" slug=\"brink\">Brink</a> is a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-305\" href=\"/class-based-shooter/3015-305/\" slug=\"class-based-shooter\">class-based</a> multiplayer first-person shooter from the developers of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18883\" href=\"/enemy-territory-quake-wars/3030-18883/\" slug=\"enemy-territory-quake-wars\">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</a>, and a lot of that style of play is present and accounted for in the way the objectives are built and the classes function. The structure of the game is decent, but it's brought down by issues both large and small. The largest one is a simple lack of content. With eight maps, a lackluster arsenal, and a campaign mode that is, by default, populated with terrible AI-controlled <a data-ref-id=\"3015-597\" href=\"/ai-bots/3015-597/\" slug=\"ai-bots\">bots</a>, Brink just doesn't have enough going for it to justify a full-price purchase.</p><p style=\"\">The game is roughly the same in both its campaign mode and its freeplay option. The difference is that the campaign mode offers up the different maps in a set order (which you can skip around, if you want) and the freeplay mode is a more open option that lets you jump into a game on any map, theoretically making it easier to get into games with real people. But both modes let you play with humans, if you like.</p><p style=\"\">This is handy, because the game's bots are <i>bad</i> at playing Brink. Bots will run up against objects you're interacting with, as if they can't see you and are trying to complete the objective that you're already completing. The enemy team's bots will often run right past objectives completely, and they'll occasionally just sort of stare at you, like they've forgotten to shoot back. The only dependable thing a bot can do is revive you if you go down, though the medic bots tend run blindly in your direction when you drop, often getting taken out along the way. This stooge-like behavior lasts for most of the match, but when an objective is nearly expired, it seems like the bots suddenly get better, almost as if they've been designed to make the missions draw themselves out as long as they possibly can. If you don't intend to play Brink against people, do not play Brink.</p><p style=\"\">That said, my recommendation for the game doesn't change much for those of you interested in playing with human teammates, largely because the game can become choppy and unplayable if you end up getting connected to a bad host, which seems to happen more often than it does in most other games, though your experience may vary. The one big positive is that the game rewards varied teams by letting each of the four different classes contribute and buff in different ways. The engineers can increase a teammate's weapon damage. Medics can raise a player's health beyond the maximum, as well as increasing a player's ability to regenerate health. Soldiers can refill ammo. And the operatives can mark targets and takeover enemy turrets. Admittedly, that's not all that different from other class-based shooters, but it's effective here and encourages players to not all rush for the one class that can complete the next objective. Also, weapon selection is detached from class selection, so you can carry whatever you like and still contribute to the team in any of the four roles.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1039461-brinkstill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1039461\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1039461-brinkstill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1039461\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1039461-brinkstill.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The universe has some neat ideas in it, but you rarely get a sense of that while playing.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Beyond that, playing Brink is a bit of a mess. The weapons are incredibly underwhelming. Part of this is due to the sound design, which doesn't give anything an appropriate punch when it's fired. But the weapon damage feels weak and the bullet spray makes a lot of the non-scoped weapons feel imprecise and generally ineffective. <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">Grenades</a> are also lame, with pops that look and sound more like a firecracker than a hand grenade. They also don't seem to do much damage, making them better for knocking opponents over, giving you time to finish them off while they get back to their feet.</p><p style=\"\">A lot of time in each map is spent running back to the battle, as the game lacks any sort of forward spawn capability. To let you worry less about obstacles in the environment, holding down the sprint button also allows you to automatically mantle up and over low objects. You can also slide under objects or, in some cases, you can leap up to grab ledges. Vaulting over these objects makes the path back to the battlefield more of a straight line, but once you're engaged, it feels like hopping around like a crazy person is just a good way to get gunned down because you weren't spending your time firing back.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Brink occasionally hints at a larger universe with its pre-mission cutscenes that attempt to set up the conflict between a rebel force and the security crew trying to hold them back, but these vignettes are incredibly half-hearted, introducing few characters and not really giving you much of a reason to care about the overall world. It's too bad, because the characters and the set of islands they inhabit have an interesting look to them. But beyond a couple of weak cutscenes you'll see when you finish campaign mode and some dull audio logs, Brink does absolutely nothing of value with its fiction.</p><p style=\"\">You'll earn experience points and levels as you play, and with each level comes the chance to unlock a new ability. These vary from universal skills like extra health or the ability to reload while sprinting to class-specific perks, like building better engineer turrets or giving operatives a bomb in their head that lets them blow up on command when downed, potentially taking enemies along with them. You don't have to break these up into loadouts, as all your abilities stack.</p><p style=\"\">This makes you more powerful at higher levels, something the game attempts to address by preventing higher-ranked players from getting matched with lower-ranked games. Ultimately, this just splits the people playing Brink into yet another smaller subset, which, at least in the near-term, has made it fairly hard for me to get into games with an abundance of other human players. Between breaking up the campaign mode options by map and the rank lockouts, Brink just feels like it needs a big \"quick match\" button to expedite the process and match you with human players and completely sidestep the game's weak AI.</p><p style=\"\">Brink's stylized look is pretty cool, but the whole thing feels like a bust. The minute-to-minute action just isn't interesting enough to make the game's eight maps worth replaying for a serious length of time, which makes a lot of this come down to a basic value proposition. It feels like a downloadable game's worth of content that's been fleshed out a little by some slightly higher production values. Nothing about that sounds like a great deal to me at its current price, but its awkward structure and dull combat won't go away after a simple price cut.</p>", "deck": "Flat combat and a lack of variety are just two of the things that make Brink such a disappointment.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-379/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26694/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/brink/3030-26694/", "id": 26694, "name": "Brink"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2011-05-10 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84220/", "id": 84220, "name": "Brink"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/lego-pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-video-game-revie/1900-380/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1724294-lpotc1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1724294\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1724294-lpotc1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1724294\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/1724294-lpotc1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There is no character in existence immune to the Lego treatment.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3010-125\" href=\"/travellers-tales-ltd/3010-125/\" slug=\"travellers-tales-ltd\">Traveller's Tales</a>' <a data-ref-id=\"3025-448\" href=\"/lego/3025-448/\" slug=\"lego\">Lego</a> action series may have been skirting the risk of oversaturation for a while now, but it's hard to fault the company's prodigious output when it keeps upping its own quality bar. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33207\" href=\"/lego-pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-video-game/3030-33207/\" slug=\"lego-pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-video-game\">Lego Pirates of the Caribbean</a> is already the second Lego game in the first five months of this year, so it's no surprise how closely it hews to the specific formula these games have been using since the very beginning. But Pirates advances the look and feel of the Lego series in enough meaningful ways that it's mostly a genuine pleasure to play, provided you haven't had your fill of Lego action already.<br/><br/>This package covers all four <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> movies, including the new not-quite-yet-released-at-the-time-of-this-writing flick On Stranger Tides. You get five lengthy levels per movie that all spawn from an island hub area, which is itself bursting with scores of unlockable characters, cheat code-enabling pickups, and sundry other collectibles. This series has always been about amassing as much of its collectible riches as possible, and I still found myself getting sucked into the feedback loop of collecting Lego studs to buy new characters and cheats so I could go back to previous levels and access new areas so I could get even more studs so I could buy more... well, you get the picture, but the point is, the formula still works.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1780691-screen_shot_2011_05_11_at_3.18.12_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1780691\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56093623890234\" data-width=\"1239\" style=\"width: 1239px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1780691-screen_shot_2011_05_11_at_3.18.12_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1780691\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1780691-screen_shot_2011_05_11_at_3.18.12_pm.png\"></a><figcaption>The puzzle design has gotten a bit more sensible.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At least it works when it's supported by well-designed gameplay and a subject matter that lends itself to the irreverent Lego treatment, and Pirates succeeds on both of those fronts better than some past Lego games. The movie franchise itself is already pretty silly, so <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2381\" href=\"/jack-sparrow/3005-2381/\" slug=\"jack-sparrow\">Captain Sparrow</a> and friends slide right into the ridiculous, mute cinematic style Traveller's Tales has polished to a high sheen over the last few years. There are plenty of great little touches spread throughout the game, like Lego Sparrow's ostentatious walk animation or the way the cursed crew of the Black Pearl seamlessly turns skeletal when they step into moonlight. The game does a great job of recreating the feel of the movies and eliciting a good number of chuckles.</p><p style=\"\">Trial and error has traditionally ruled the experience of playing these Lego games. In this one you'll still spend plenty of time busting up every piece of scenery you can until you figure out what it is you need to do--which still has a simple charm to it, don't get me wrong--but at least Pirates is a little better about directing your attention via floating button prompts and other onscreen iconography than previous Lego games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20822\" href=\"/lego-batman-the-video-game/3030-20822/\" slug=\"lego-batman-the-video-game\">Batman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26753\" href=\"/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4/3030-26753/\" slug=\"lego-harry-potter-years-1-4\">Harry Potter</a>. In this relative absence of head-scratching \"what the hell do I do now?\" moments, the game peppers some more thoughtful environmental puzzles here and there, as well as some neat action setpiece moments that have you sword fighting up on catwalks or riding giant water wheels through the jungle. The game isn't without its frustrations: any sort of platforming or jumping-based puzzle usually ends in gritted teeth, and the dynamic split-screen that comes into effect in co-op isn't as intelligent as it should be. (Put those two specific things together and you may end up throwing a controller.) But these levels are more varied and rewarding to play through than I remember those old Lego games being.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1780695-screen_shot_2011_05_11_at_3.18.33_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1780695\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55896607431341\" data-width=\"1238\" style=\"width: 1238px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1780695-screen_shot_2011_05_11_at_3.18.33_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1780695\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1780695-screen_shot_2011_05_11_at_3.18.33_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1780695-screen_shot_2011_05_11_at_3.18.33_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lego Mortal Kombat, coming soon.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's kind of shocking how much the graphics and presentation of the Lego series have matured over time, culminating in this game with a visual style that doesn't just look fantastic for a Lego game, but for any game.

Like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-6\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a> and its legion of imitators, this game has a sprawling, open city environment for you to explore, but don't expect to grab a Tommy gun and wreak havoc in that city whenever you feel like it. This just isn't that kind of game. Instead, the focus is squarely on good, clean police work: scouring crime scenes for evidence, extracting information from persons of interest whether they're willing to talk or not, building a case, making an arrest.

You'll regularly find yourself cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, responding to a call for backup at 5th and Figueroa, or investigating a crime scene at the city's classic Egyptian Theater. Likewise, L.A.

Noire's open world is, it's incidental to the way the game unfolds. You don't follow one seamless timeline from beginning to end, roaming around the city and picking up missions at will from people with exclamation marks over their heads or something. Instead the game is broken up into 17 lengthy vignettes, each focusing on a single case file and each one feeding directly into the next, often with time passing in between. Phelps will work different desks like arson, homicide, and vice as he ascends the LAPD ladder, and the multiple cases you investigate on each desk contribute to individual story arcs that themselves serve as single acts within the greater plot. You'll get to know new cops and crooks at each desk, but important characters tend to pop up again and again throughout the game, creating a cohesive storyline that goes to some dark places and becomes tense as all hell as it builds toward its climax. The writing is among the best in the business, creating some really memorable and often despicable characters who speak with just the sort of antiquated speech necessary to make the dialog feel appropriate to the setting.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784268-la_noire_screenshot_422.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784268\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784268-la_noire_screenshot_422.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784268\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784268-la_noire_screenshot_422.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784268-la_noire_screenshot_422.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Steely Capt. Donnelly here wants you to bring back a confession--at any cost.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game's episodic structure is effective preicsely because you're playing by police rules, and Phelps is such a by-the-book kind of guy. It would be entirely out of character and context for you to blow up a block full of cars or wantonly go on a shooting spree in the middle of MacArthur Park, and in fact, you can't even draw your gun unless you're placed in a situation where you reasonably need to use it. Repeat: no random acts of violence allowed. I can respect the limits the game places on your open-world freedom; these limits are there in service of the story and maintaining your immersion within it. There seems to be an awareness of those limits in the design, too, since you're not actually required to drive to each new destination; you can set a map waypoint and have your partner drive, effectively fast-travelling you directly there if you just want to get on with the detective stuff. Since you're never in the car for more than a few minutes at once, I found myself doing almost all the driving myself just to take in the city's sights, and because the game does a good job of masking its load times with the driving sequences, making for a more seamless experience. Driving around during a case also gives you the chance to unlock new Los Angeles landmarks and respond to petty street crimes called out over police dispatch, both of which carry peripheral benefits in addition to giving you a break from the case at hand, but I'll get to those in a bit. (There's a lot going on in this game.)</p><p style=\"\">That's all side stuff, anyway. You play L.A. Noire primarily to solve crimes, and your investigations are broken down into a few specific mechanical components that all feed into each other to generate new leads for you to follow. Your first step is almost always to visit the crime scene itself and gather clues, and the game does a great job of letting you get up close and hands-on with the evidence, letting you manipulate suspicious objects, documents, and even corpses directly. The detail on this stuff is fine enough that you can extract really specific information, like a gun's serial number, and add it to the list of people, places, and clues that you manage in an in-game notebook. There are some neat puzzles scattered here and there that have you piecing objects back together or solving clockwork locks and things of that nature, so it's not all just eyeballing an insurance policy for incriminating information (though there is that, too).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784263-la_noire_screenshot_390.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784263\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784263-la_noire_screenshot_390.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784263\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784263-la_noire_screenshot_390.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784263-la_noire_screenshot_390.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can't build a case without gathering the right evidence...</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Then there's the game's most talked-about--and what I suspect will be its most divisive--feature, the conversation system. This is where you ask questions (or demand answers) from suspects or other people of interest, then have to determine whether they're telling you the truth or not, and if necessary, present some kind of evidence to disprove their statements. Yes, it's not unlike <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19409\" href=\"/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney/3030-19409/\" slug=\"phoenix-wright-ace-attorney\">Phoenix Wright</a>. In the absence of the right evidence, you have to look at their faces and body language, and also try to get inside their heads and think about their motives, to get the right \"answer.\" There <i>is</i> only one right answer to each question, which will probably put some people off, and I'd agree this would be a damnable offense if failing to catch a suspect in a lie triggered some kind of failure or restart. But instead you'll merely miss out on some piece of information and be required to make up for it in some other way, which changes the course of your investigation and gives the flow of each case a dynamic feel. If you, like me, are the sort of person who exhausted every single dialog choice in Mass Effect, you'll eat this stuff up and wish there were more of it.</p><p style=\"\">The chance of missing information isn't unique to the conversations. The most important thing to know about the investigations in L.A. Noire is that there's a relatively high degree of variability in the way a case plays out. You can't \"fail\" a case, per se; you'll always conclude it by nabbing <i>someone</i>--again, making an arrest is more important to most of these cops than discovering the truth--even if that someone isn't actually the right person. But the route you take to get there depends on all kinds of factors, like whether you noticed a crucial piece of evidence or not, or what order you chose to visit a list of locations on your agenda. I went back and played several cases again (the game lets you do this easily from a cases menu) and found several clues I had missed earlier, which allowed me to construct a stronger line of questioning and solve the cases more expeditiously than the first time around. A couple of times, I completed cases without even visiting every location or talking to every suspect, since I'd already gathered enough evidence to go after the perpetrator. It's ironic that the worse you perform, the more content you'll potentially see, but this flexibility helped me feel like I was doing my own casework instead of following a single, rigid \"correct\" path through each case.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784273-la_noire_screenshot_440.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784273\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784273-la_noire_screenshot_440.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784273\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784273-la_noire_screenshot_440.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784273-la_noire_screenshot_440.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>...but sometimes you can just let your piece do the talking.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">How thoroughly you run your investigation feeds into a five-star rating presented at the end of a case, and this rating directly informs the praise or dressing-down you get from your current superior. (You really don't want to raise the ire of the Irish captain of the homicide squad, with all his righteous sword-of-justice blarney.) More importantly, the rating feeds into a thin RPG layer where you rank up and earn \"intuition\" points that you can cash in to ease the interrogation and evidence-gathering aspects. You can also unlock new suits for Phelps and a number of fast, fancy cars by ranking up. Doing other side activities like discovering the LA landmarks and completing the street crime missions also generate experience points, so there's a feedback mechanism in place to encourage you to get into the side activities. There are 40 of those petty crime missions, which are usually only a few minutes long and culminate in some kind of quick action sequence after a short cinematic setup explaining what's going on. Expect bank heists, peeping toms, and other undesirable elements of society that need addressing.</p><p style=\"\">Those types of action sequences also punctuate the story-driven cases when the situation becomes dire enough to call for them. You'll end up chasing a lot of suspects on foot, and you can stop them in their tracks with a warning shot if you can hold your aim on them long enough. Otherwise you'll usually end up getting into a fistfight with them, or gunning them down if they take a hostage. The game does have occasional full-on shooting sequences, operating on a perfectly competent cover-based model, though it should tell you something that there's an achievement for gunning down 100 bad guys and I didn't get it until the last case of the game. The car chases are my favorite aspect of the game's action sequences; the loose, arcade-like handling lets you skid around corners and deftly evade traffic as you try to get close enough for your partner to shoot out a suspect's tire from the passenger side. Then you ram the guy off the road or flip him over. All of this action is relatively basic but hard-hitting enough to be quite entertaining, and these sequences pop up just often enough to provide a nice contrast to the more sedate investigative work.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784257-la_noire_screenshot_363.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784257\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784257-la_noire_screenshot_363.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784257\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784257-la_noire_screenshot_363.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784257-la_noire_screenshot_363.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The noir stylings really help sell the experience.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game comes by its title honestly, doing just about everything it can to evoke the noir classics from the period that inspired it. That ranges from the typeface used to present each case's title to the fact that you can play the entire game in black and white, which enables the sort of harsh contrast you would expect from the genre. The big-orchestra score feels completely appropriate for the setting and subject matter, and there's a great musical aspect to the investigations as well. When you're out looking for clues you'll get single notes from the piano and stand-up bass indicating there's more evidence to be found, and sustained strings add some discomfort to the interrogations when the tension starts to build between Phelps and his subject. And the game pulls no punches at all. The seedy underside of Los Angeles is an ugly, ugly place: racism, misogyny, rape, pedophilia, mutilation, infidelity, betrayal, and a truckload of grisly corpses (that you'll get up close and personal with) are just some of the elements that underpin the game's cases. It definitely earns its mature rating.</p><p style=\"\">Talking about the presentation, a review of this game would be remiss without discussing the performances, because all the ballyhoo about L.A. Noire's facial animation is not for nothing. Judged purely by their faces, these are simply the most impressively believable characters I've ever seen in a game. It doesn't hurt that the performances range from good to stellar (you'll recognize a ton of character actors from all over the place), but the technology is what enables those performances to really show in every furrowed brow and widened eye. The sheer malleability of these faces--the wrinkles and expressions and nuances that can appear and then disappear before you even process them--is almost unnerving. There are some cases where the body movements look stilted or unnatural in contrast to the startling quality of the faces, but on the whole the believability of these characters plays a huge part of making L.A. Noire what it is. The game wouldn't work nearly as well without them.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784254-la_noire_screenshot_338.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784254\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1784254-la_noire_screenshot_338.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1784254\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784254-la_noire_screenshot_338.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1784254-la_noire_screenshot_338.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The quality of the performances and facial animation is second to none.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Having spent a lot of time with both versions of L.A. Noire, the PlayStation 3 game is the clear-cut winner. Both versions of the game look fantastic, but there were a few instances of painful frame rate drops and objects drawing in too slowly on the Xbox that didn't exist on the PS3. Also, the shadows look a bit more jagged. This is splitting hairs, since both games look good enough that you should just get the one on the platform you prefer, though the PS3 also has the added benefit of being on a single disc to the Xbox's three, and includes an exclusive downloadable case (which I didn't get to try, and you probably won't be able to play either until the PlayStation Store is back online).</p><p style=\"\">L.A. Noire is a bold release, because it defies the expectations not just for the type of game Rockstar usually releases, but also for the type of game that receives this degree of care and proficiency in its execution. The world already has enough open-world action games, but a game which marries that open world to such a methodical style of gameplay, with a budget this big, is a rare thing indeed.</p>", "deck": "Rockstar's bold open-world adventure game wraps macabre '40s grit around gripping detective work.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-381/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21500/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/la-noire/3030-21500/", "id": 21500, "name": "L.A.

In this apocalyptic world, massive earthquakes devastate the planet, laying waste to urban landscapes. Rather than run around screaming about it, people of this terrible future take the tack of, \"When life gives you lemons, build a deadly race track out of lemons,\" and turn all this destruction into an opportunity for some remarkably dangerous auto racing. Even outside the game itself, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-995\" href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated/3010-995/\" slug=\"sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated\">Sony</a> was forced to deal with misfortune outside of its immediate control, with both its release hype being hampered by the horrific earthquakes in Japan, and the costly PSN outage that robbed players of the game's best feature--its online multiplayer--for weeks following release. Yet, for all these misfortunes, both purposeful and not, only one really matters, and it's the one that MotorStorm: Apocalypse ultimately can't quite overcome: it is a driving game in which driving often isn't all that fun.</p><p style=\"\">It's not because of the admittedly divisive driving-style this series has always employed, mind you. You're either bought in on MotorStorm's central conceit--multiple vehicle classes, from motorcycles to semis, all racing on the same track--or you aren't. Nor is it strictly a matter of the series' sometimes sluggish, often floaty-feeling physics. While those looking for an upgraded feel to the game's driving style will be disappointed--it seriously feels a lot like the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24793\" href=\"/motorstorm/3030-24793/\" slug=\"motorstorm\">MotorStorm</a> game across the board--those floaty mechanics aren't always to the game's detriment.</p><p style=\"\">What is to the game's detriment is, sadly, also the game's most compelling feature. Namely, that of the wanton obliteration that covers every inch of the game's tracks. First, the good: this stuff looks incredible. When you're racing on a track in the game's fictional city (which is more than loosely-based on <a data-ref-id=\"3035-191\" href=\"/san-francisco/3035-191/\" slug=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</a>), everything is in an ever-morphing state of disrepair. Earthquakes have already completely ravaged the city, leaving highways, buildings, and miscellaneous debris scattered every which way.</p><p style=\"\">It's impressive destruction made even more so by the real-time nature of it. As you drive through courses, more tremors will often strike, leading to new deformation of the environment and adjusted paths and jumps for you to take. Sometimes you'll even find yourself dodging (or ramming) random survivors with firearms and rocket launchers, who clearly have taken none too kind to a bunch of no-goodniks rampaging through their obliterated burg. The game's visuals are top-flight, creating impressive amounts of debris and chaos around you at all times. It's exactly as insane-looking as a game like this should be.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1398778-997559_20100610_screen014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398778\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.52083333333333\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1398778-997559_20100610_screen014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398778\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1398778-997559_20100610_screen014.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The scope of the game's destruction is often breathtaking.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">So, why isn't it more fun? For the same reason it looks so great, Apocalypse is frequently a frustrating mess. The on-screen chaos is, at times, indecipherable. Is that piece of freeway that's jutted outward part of the track? Or an untraversable obstacle? Whoops, before I could figure it out, I exploded. Any number of variations on that theme rear their head throughout the game's various tracks. There are jumps that aren't quite jumps; derelict cars that look like other racers, but aren't; showers of sparks and fire and whatever else that morph into an aesthetically pleasing, if borderline dysfunctional track environment.</p><p style=\"\">Fun fact: crashing over and over again isn't that much fun, unless you're <a data-ref-id=\"3025-76\" href=\"/burnout/3025-76/\" slug=\"burnout\">Burnout</a>, where that's the point. It's not the point here. Success or failure hangs on the thin string of your personal reaction time, in which case, the game's sometimes sludgy controls can actually be a detriment on occasion. If you're the controller-destroying type, somewhere around your umpteenth surprise explosion, you may find yourself attempting to recall some images of a calm blue ocean to avoid another expensive, rage-induced tantrum. Perhaps you can use the game's exceedingly lengthy between-track load times to rub your temples and do a little deep breathing.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's a shame, because once you break past that wall of irritating, accidental death--which you'll likely do by just memorizing all the courses and their destruction patterns, since they don't change from race-to-race--there is certainly some fun to be had here in a multiplayer environment. Going online and playing against up to 15 other racers can be a blast under optimal circumstances, especially if you get into playing around with the unlockable perks--which aid elements like your boost ability, traction, and reset times--and the online betting system, where you can choose an online rival and make special effort to beat them for fun and profit. Online races are certainly competitive, but they also just happen to be kind of a crapshoot unless you've memorized all the courses.</p><p style=\"\">I haven't mentioned the game's single-player element, because honestly, I'm trying to forget it. The game's \"story\" mode is an atrocious, dim-witted, utterly unpleasant experience from top-to-bottom. It tries to give copious amounts of context where none is really needed. Do we care about the personalities behind this absurd racing league? I'm guessing not. And yet the mode is replete with talky cutscenes filled with miserably animated \"comic-book\" art that looks roughly equivalent to Rob Liefeld attempting to draw a Mountain Dew commercial. Every scene draws so heavily from that weird place of hyper-cheesy \"extremeness\" that so permeated sports culture of the early 2000s that it feels like the game should have just been introduced by a shot of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-834\" href=\"/jonny-moseley-mad-trix/3030-834/\" slug=\"jonny-moseley-mad-trix\">Jonny Moseley</a> positing the question, \"What if it earthquaked in San Francisco?\" followed by a record scratch, the opening refrain of a Zebrahead song, and a shot of two girls in bikinis eating apocalypse-flavored Doritos.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1791700-motorstorm_apocalypse_cutscene.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791700\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1791700-motorstorm_apocalypse_cutscene.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791700\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/1791700-motorstorm_apocalypse_cutscene.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/1791700-motorstorm_apocalypse_cutscene.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Because crappy motion comics are totally what MotorStorm was missing, right?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Were it limited to a single, crappy storyline, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

Again, the load times are not.</p><p style=\"\">When the elements align and the clouds of frustration break, MotorStorm: Apocalypse is kind of awesome.

The Dirt series has developed a reputation for flashy menus and strong tone, most recently in Dirt 2, which maintained an almost overwhelming “totally rad Mountain Dew bro” attitude throughout the game. Dirt 3 sheds all this and instead opts for something more like “hanging out at the bar in a trendy Berlin hotel,” with its artsy triangular motifs and chill electronic music. While I personally preferred the stronger, more cohesive tone of the previous game, others may find this to be a welcome change. In any event, the menus are much faster and easier to navigate than Dirt 2’s immersive but somewhat cumbersome RV interface.</p><p style=\"\">Selecting Dirt Tour will take you to the campaign, where you’ll see familiar modes like rally (point-to-point races), rallycross (motocross with cars), landrush (like rallycross but with trucks or buggies), trailblazer (like rally but with super fast cars), and head-2-head (one-on-one circuit races). Dirt 3 has also added a new mode, gymkhana, to the mix, but more on that later. Each mode is featured in a number of multi-race series that are spread throughout the campaign. Series of differing modes are grouped together in events, which unlock as the player earns points by doing well in each series. At the same time, the player earns “rep” points that can be used to unlock more cars. Rep points are earned by placing well, completing optional missions such as reaching a certain top speed, and by conserving flashbacks, the Dirt series’ name for its rewind feature.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1791701-cockpitnight.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791701\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1791701-cockpitnight.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791701\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23546/1791701-cockpitnight.png\"></a><figcaption>Nighttime cockpit mode in the snow will put hair on your chest.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Unlike Dirt 2, which grouped series by locale, Dirt 3 jumps around between eight environments: Aspen (snow!), Finland, Kenya, the L.A. Coliseum, Michigan, Monaco, Norway, and the Smelter industrial site. That’s one fewer locale than Dirt 2, but Dirt 3 makes up for it with an increased number of tracks (double that of Dirt 2) and the inclusion of weather and time-of-day options. A wet track plays significantly differently from a dry one, as does one at night that you’ve previously only seen during the day. Some circuit tracks are so dark that you’ll find yourself having to memorize where turns are, turning blindly into blackness, hoping that your headlights will reveal some familiar section of wall. Nighttime rally courses are similarly intense, requiring you to rely almost exclusively on your co-driver for directions. Night races are, in short, awesome.</p><p style=\"\">If that sounds crazy to you, don’t worry. Dirt 3 has made things easier on newer players by including optional throttle, brake, and steering assists. The game won’t quite play itself, but it can come pretty darn close. A dynamic racing line is also included. Like pretty much every other modern racing game, the line shows the best way around the track and changes color when it’s time to brake. As mentioned before, flashbacks are back, except now you get five of them per race, regardless of difficulty. Some may consider this feature a “dumbing down” of the game, but in my experience, having that safety nets encourages you to try riskier moves and ultimately become a better driver. Also, as far as I could tell, difficulty barely matters. Playing on a harder setting, while much more difficult in terms of how good your opponents are, does not affect the amount of points you get at the end of the series, nor does it affect your rep points. Really, the only thing holding you back from blasting through the game on easy is shame.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1791699-youtube.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791699\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1791699-youtube.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791699\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23546/1791699-youtube.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23546/1791699-youtube.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Uploading a clip to YouTube is as easy as watching a progress bar.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">For those worried that the game may be losing its hardcore roots, fear not. Dirt 3 retains the series’ signature physics-regulated handling system, and even improves it a bit by adding independent suspension so cars rock realistically with changes in direction. It’s hardly a noticeable improvement until you go back to Dirt 2 and try to play without it. The graphics are similarly improved, with many minor upgrades conspiring to create some truly beautiful environments, and at no cost to a steady framerate.</p><p style=\"\">But Dirt 3 isn’t all about improvements to existing features. It’s got some new ones as well, like YouTube integration. At any point during a flashback or after-race replay, one button takes you into the YouTube clip editing mode. Simply set an “in” and “out” point (the clips are limited to 30 seconds) and start uploading. The tools are fairly easy to use and require nothing more than a YouTube user name and password. Your <a href=\"http://youtu.be/wxXFrTcHkRg\" rel=\"nofollow\">uploaded videos</a> aren’t HD quality, and they take a while to render and upload (about 10 minutes for a 30 second clip with my 3Mbps upstream connection), but it’s a great way to preserve and share any crazy moments you have.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">In addition to the standard racing modes in the campaign, players will also run across gymkhana events. Gymkhana events are trick-based, taking place in open areas stuffed with obstacles for you to drift through, jump over, and do donuts around. There are a few different types, namely sprint (do these tricks in this order), smash attack (smack cardboard cutouts of robots with your car), speed run (make it through these gates in time), and attack (do these tricks in any order). This sort of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-430\" href=\"/project-gotham-racing/3025-430/\" slug=\"project-gotham-racing\">Project Gotham</a> Kudos-meets-<a data-ref-id=\"3030-7236\" href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater/3030-7236/\" slug=\"tony-hawks-pro-skater\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> style of gameplay is lots of fun, but it can get pretty challenging. Fortunately, Dirt 3 features a free-roam area known as the Battersea Compound where players can practice their drifting skills without the pressure of a time limit. Collectibles and missions unique to this open area, like drifting around a backhoe, make Battersea a pretty cool spot to hang out in.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1791708-gymsplit.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791708\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1791708-gymsplit.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791708\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23546/1791708-gymsplit.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23546/1791708-gymsplit.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gymkhana! Split-screen!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Gymkhana, as well as the rest of the racing modes from the campaign, also makes an appearance in multiplayer. Players can test their skills against each other in point-based matches, but the real action is in the party games. These modes, available as team or solo ranked and unranked matches, eschew most of the racing pretext and become full-blown minigames. They range from Outbreak, which takes place on a gymkhana course and is sort of a free-for-all capture the flag-meets-tag, to Cat ‘n’ Mouse, where two teams of rally cars have to escort their team’s underpowered “mouse” car to the finish while blocking the other team. These modes are a ton of fun. The game also supports local split-screen multiplayer for two people, a first for the series.</p><p style=\"\">In order to play online, however, players are required to enter a code for the game’s “VIP Pass” (included in the game case), which also unlocks five additional cars and the ability to upload YouTube clips. As of this writing, the PlayStation Store is offline, making it impossible for PS3 players to redeem this code and consequently take part in any of the VIP Pass benefits, including online play.</p><p style=\"\">The Dirt series has carved out a nice little niche in the racing game genre, one between the who-needs-the-brake-button-anyway madness of games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-537\" href=\"/motorstorm/3025-537/\" slug=\"motorstorm\">Motorstorm</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-76\" href=\"/burnout/3025-76/\" slug=\"burnout\">Burnout</a>, and clinical, it’s-fun-because-it’s-real simulations like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-263\" href=\"/gran-turismo/3025-263/\" slug=\"gran-turismo\">Gran Turismo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-199\" href=\"/forza-motorsport/3025-199/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport\">Forza</a>. Dirt splits the difference, offering crazy mud-covered tracks and approachable yet nuanced controls, which combine to create the perfect blend of fun and challenge. Dirt 3, the latest installment, is no exception, and everything fans of the series have come to love in past games has been tuned and upgraded, making it feel an awful lot like the definitive off-road racing game.</p>", "deck": "Dirt 3 isn't as big a jump forward as Dirt 2 was, but tweaks and additional modes and features make it as deep as it is fun.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-383/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30383/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dirt-3/3030-30383/", "id": 30383, "name": "DiRT 3"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2011-05-24 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-108230/", "id": 108230, "name": "Dirt 3"}, "reviewer": "Drew"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/red-faction-armageddon-review/1900-384/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1799248-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.38.55_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799248\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55744336569579\" data-width=\"1236\" style=\"width: 1236px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1799248-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.38.55_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799248\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1799248-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.38.55_pm.png\"></a><figcaption>Darius Mason: Short on character development, and hair.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-25726\" href=\"/red-faction-armageddon/3030-25726/\" slug=\"red-faction-armageddon\">Red Faction: Armageddon</a> marginalizes, or outright ignores, some of the best qualities of its predecessor, the gleefully destructive Marsbox <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21125\" href=\"/red-faction-guerrilla/3030-21125/\" slug=\"red-faction-guerrilla\">Red Faction: Guerilla</a>. In place of that game's open world and its boundless opportunities for completely wrecking everything in sight, Armageddon constrains your freedom to an unflinchingly linear corridor crawl. The destructible environments are still here, but they're largely reduced to window dressing, except when they're actively getting in the way of your progress. There's a handful of neat weapons and vehicle sequences over the course of the campaign, but they aren't enough to redeem Armageddon's functional but bland and often repetitive third-person shooting.</p><p style=\"\">The game casts you as scrappy, bald gun-for-hire <a data-ref-id=\"3005-18204\" href=\"/darius-mason/3005-18204/\" slug=\"darius-mason\">Darius Mason</a>, a descendant of Guerilla's revolutionary hero <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9526\" href=\"/alec-mason/3005-9526/\" slug=\"alec-mason\">Alec Mason</a>.

The shooting itself feels fine; it's just that two or three hours of doing it over and over reveals how unthreatening and rote the enemies' behavior is, removing any sense of danger or tension as you move into new combat scenarios. The handful of enemy types generally either cling to walls and shoot at you, or charge straight at you on the ground, and some careful observation will reveal them basically doing the exact things over and over, to the point that the wall-hangers will actually jump between the same points on the walls repeatedly. The hours and hours of combat are broken up by a few superficial and highly destructive vehicle sequences that are fun for a few minutes but really don't give you much more than a brief arcade thrill.</p><p style=\"\">It's too bad the enemies aren't a stiffer and more dynamic challenge, because a few of the game's weapons are pretty good. The clear standout is the magnet gun, which lets you attach one node to an enemy or breakable surface, then a second node anywhere else, causing whatever the first node is stuck on to rocket toward the second node and go splat. The singularity launcher is also satisfying, as it creates a little gravity well that causes everything--enemies and scenery alike--to swirl around in the air for a few seconds before it explodes and does huge damage.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Both of these weapons, and more mundane destructive implements like a rocket launcher, can also be used to take apart structures the game designates as breakable. Tearing down buildings with abandon can be a lot of fun--that was inarguably the cornerstone of Guerrilla, in fact--but outside the rare objective to take down an infested building, Armageddon doesn't give you a lot of reasons, or even opportunities, to meaningfully destroy things. There are plenty of cases where you and some of the burlier enemies will actually end up destroying sets of stairs and walkways that you need to traverse to get to the next objective, and while the game arms you with a handheld device that can restore destroyed surfaces to their original state, it gets to be a chore rebuilding the level around you repeatedly just so you can move on. That repair device trips a glowing visual effect that looks neat the first few times you use it, but ultimately this mechanic doesn't add much to the campaign.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1799253-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.41.10_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799253\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55967741935484\" data-width=\"1240\" style=\"width: 1240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1799253-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.41.10_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799253\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1799253-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.41.10_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1799253-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.41.10_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You will kill so, so many of these guys.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Armageddon lacks any sort of competitive multiplayer, but it's got Infestation, a wave-based survival mode for four players that's reasonably entertaining if you haven't burned out on the combat in the campaign yet. The nicest thing about Infestation is that the currency you earn there--and you earn it a lot faster than in the story--can be carried back over to your character for campaign play. So there's a good incentive to take a break from the single-player and boost your upgrades before you resume fighting for the salvation of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-4\" href=\"/mars/3035-4/\" slug=\"mars\">Mars</a>. But since the look and feel of the combat, enemies, and maps in Infestation are identical to that of the campaign, I had no desire to keep playing the multiplayer once I'd finished the story. There's also a timed Ruin mode for players who buy the game new. This one lets you destroy small maps under a time limit for maximum score, but the score requirements here are so stringent that it's not much fun to actually try to unlock each subsequent map (though there is a free mode that lets you truly run amok).</p><p style=\"\">There's nothing wrong with a good linear third-person shooter, but Red Faction: Armageddon is merely a passable one. Its mechanics are sound but its design uninspired, failing to do any one thing better than the standout entries in the genre. And the few unique tricks it does have, its predecessor did better. After Guerrilla made such a resounding impact, it's a shame that the best you can say about this latest Red Faction is that it's just OK.</p>", "deck": "A few physics-based weapons and destructible environments can't elevate this strictly average third-person shooter.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-384/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25726/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/red-faction-armageddon/3030-25726/", "id": 25726, "name": "Red Faction: Armageddon"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-06-01 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-108247/", "id": 108247, "name": "Red Faction: Armageddon"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/duke-nukem-forever-review/1900-385/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21673/1810103-2011_06_10_00004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1810103\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21673/1810103-2011_06_10_00004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1810103\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21673/1810103-2011_06_10_00004.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">I certainly never expected that I'd write a review of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20721\" href=\"/duke-nukem-forever/3030-20721/\" slug=\"duke-nukem-forever\">Duke Nukem Forever</a>.

Its longer-than-average campaign attempts to deliver on variety by mixing in a few vehicle sequences, an underwater section, and multiple levels where you're shrunk down to tiny size and forced to carefully jump from one platform to another, but these only help make the game feel old. Most of this stuff--the platforming and awkward underwater controls, specifically--has been bred out of modern shooters for a reason. In the context of Duke Nukem Forever, a lot of these sequences feel like filler, meant to distract you from the game's lackluster action. Duke can hold two weapons at a time and has a recharging, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2\" href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" slug=\"halo\">Halo</a>-like shield meter, though it's called \"Ego\" here. This doesn't quite lead to the tactical considerations that a limited inventory might initially imply, though, as the only time you really need a specific weapon is when you're in a boss fight. The game's bosses can only be damaged by turrets or <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">RPGs</a>, so whenever you get into one of these situations, the game makes sure that you have the appropriate weaponry nearby.</p><p style=\"\">The arsenal covers most of what you'd expect from a Duke Nukem game, including a shrink ray and a freeze beam that lets you toy around with enemies a little bit. Duke 3D had one of my all-time favorite shotguns (which is a pretty short list), and the gun returns in Duke Nukem Forever feeling mostly intact. Blasting pigs up close and watching them crumble after one shot is kind of satisfying, even after all these years.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1814262-dnf_vegas_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814262\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1814262-dnf_vegas_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814262\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1814262-dnf_vegas_1.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">But that's probably the only true satisfaction to be found in Duke Nukem Forever. We're past the point of getting thrills from basic interactivity like \"hey, you can flush the toilets\" or \"oh, you can sort of play this awful pinball machine.\" If the core shooting in the game was exciting, these lame little extras would be forgivable. Instead, they make you wonder if the main parts of Duke would have been better if people weren't wasting their time making sure that the pool tables almost work. Enemies don't really burst apart in a satisfying way, and the bulk of the weaponry feels underwhelming. The console versions of the game also lose something extra in the translation, as an unstable frame rate that only seems to get worse when you're firing heavy weaponry makes everything that much harder to follow.</p><p style=\"\">The action is often monotonous and basic in a way that doesn't even leave room for \"old-school\" thrills. This is a game that allows for headshots, but certainly doesn't require them. Most enemies don't put out too much of a fight and they go down relatively easily. The game doesn't make up for their weakness by throwing large numbers of bad guys at you at once, and there are even large sections of the game where there's no combat at all. Considering most of the non-combat sequences require you to wander and jump around bland, old-looking environments that feel like they were touched-up by someone wielding nothing but a shader that somehow makes every single surface look slightly greasy, the breaks from combat aren't any better than the parts where you shoot your guns. Even the boss fights get repetitive by having you face a sort-of-harder version of the game's first boss as the game's final boss.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The entire campaign is sprinkled with bits of dialogue from Duke Nukem himself. This, you might remember, is one of the key points about the character. He's a wise-cracking, movie-line-stealing misogynist who loves strippers and cigars. Back in 1996, we were still coming to terms with the idea that PC game characters could talk at all, so it was easy to fall in love with Duke's constant chatter. But times have changed, and Duke's schtick just feels unimaginative and sad in Duke Nukem Forever. Duke's still lifting his material from other sources, and he's getting a fair amount of it wrong. Plus plenty of it is way, way out of date. A mangled version of the \"remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last? I lied\" line from <i>Commando</i> makes its way in here. At one point Duke sings \"America, fuck yeah\" just because your commanding officer mentioned America. The Internet isn't safe, either, with \"porkchop sandwiches\" dropping in straight out of Eric Fensler's GI Joe PSA reedits. That happened in, what, 2003? No jokes are wrapped around these references, making the whole thing feel like some kind of sub-<i>Family Guy</i> attempt at getting you to chuckle just because you remember a line from <i>Starship Troopers</i>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1814263-dnf_vegas_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814263\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1814263-dnf_vegas_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814263\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1814263-dnf_vegas_4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1814263-dnf_vegas_4.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">When he's not \"being Duke\" by using movie catchphrases, he's \"being Duke\" by alluding to how much trim he gets. In the unironic world of Duke Nukem Forever, Duke's a superstar sex god with his own Vegas penthouse, complete with a set of sexy twins willing to do anything for him. Females that you encounter along the way fall all over themselves when they encounter you, and the first 30 minutes or so is little more than ego stroking, probably designed to remind you that Duke's a bad-ass. Men want to be him! Women want to be with him! The whole thing feels like it's trying too hard, and Duke's act was already kind of lame the first time around. This time, presented at face value without any meaningful wink or nod to modern sensibilities, the whole thing feels like it was written by crazy people. The character simply doesn't work in 2011, and now that I've played Duke Nukem Forever, I'm left wondering if the character ever truly worked at all, or if standards were just so much lower back then that we didn't bother paying much attention to how stupid it all was.</p><p style=\"\">Though some will probably be offended by some of the things in Duke Nukem Forever, it's not worth getting agitated over. Like the previous game, Duke Nukem Forever's tone is meant to be tongue-in-cheek. You'll again see topless women and some other childish dialogue to accompany those boobs. I think this tone is best summed up in one of the alien hive areas, where you stumble upon a trio of human-looking boobs just sticking out of an alien-looking wall. No bodies, just boobs. Sexy, right? You can slap them around via the use button, and Duke chuckles to himself like some kind of sociopath. It's downright creepy, and it reinforces my feeling that a game with a bit more self-awareness about how out-of-touch the Duke character feels would probably be way funnier. There's certainly a place for sophomoric humor in video games, but the attempts to include it in Duke Nukem Forever fall flat most of the time. It makes Duke feel like a sad, pathetic character that continually needs to pump himself up by reminding anyone who will listen that he is, indeed, the king.</p><p style=\"\">In addition to the campaign, the game also has a multiplayer mode with four different game types. These let you take the Duke weapons into standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, king of the hill, and capture the flag games. It has a maximum player count of eight. Hey, at least that's more than Duke Nukem 3D supported, right? You'll find a remake of the Hollywood level from Duke 3D among the 10 maps, but it just looks weirdly filthy. The map design doesn't feel like it sets you up for elaborate trip mine and pipe bomb traps like the previous game did, which is too bad, as that was one of the best parts about Duke's multiplayer. Like the rest of the game, the multiplayer feels a little mindless and old. Not classic--old.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1814264-dnf_vegas_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814264\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1814264-dnf_vegas_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814264\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1814264-dnf_vegas_7.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1814264-dnf_vegas_7.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">When comparing platforms, it's clear that the PC version was the priority for the game's developers. There, the game is capable of running at a smooth frame rate with reasonable load times between levels. The console versions look extra grimy and unoptimized--things like texture pop-in and depth of field effects aren't as clean. The frame rates aren't as stable and the load times are practically a deal breaker, with huge gaps between levels and after any death. They give you just enough time to realize that you could probably be spending your time doing something else.</p><p style=\"\">It feels weird to criticize a game that's been in development for as long as this one has for feeling like a relic, but in the end, Duke Nukem Forever's development history only really matters to a fraction of the overall audience. As I said before, if you're a part of that crowd, part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need to know how it ends, I recommend you play Duke Nukem Forever for yourself. But I'd practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on. It's great, in some ways, that Duke Nukem Forever was released at all.

Even more vivid, corrupted imagery and dark ominous tones are sifted out of the internal monologue of a person clinging desperately to their sanity, and while the player's involvement often supports the antagonistic puzzlebox of a mind gone mad, the game spreads its tricks a little thin, leaving the player ready to move on before the game itself is.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9456/1728100-the_great_hall.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1728100\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9456/1728100-the_great_hall.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1728100\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9456/1728100-the_great_hall.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Red Queen's domain is as sinister as ever.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Though the Red Queen is gone, there's a new menace in <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1541\" href=\"/alice/3005-1541/\" slug=\"alice\">Alice's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3035-477\" href=\"/wonderland/3035-477/\" slug=\"wonderland\">Wonderland</a>. Now a teenager, and under the care of a seemingly misguided pychiatrist, Alice Liddell returns to an even more twisted version of her private retreat, now under the rule of an unrelenting train being operated by an unknown force. As she delves deeper into her own addled psyche, Alice reunites with many familiar--albeit disfigured and mad as ever--faces, including the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2823\" href=\"/the-mad-hatter/3005-2823/\" slug=\"the-mad-hatter\">Hatter</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2266\" href=\"/rabbit/3015-2266/\" slug=\"rabbit\">Rabbit</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2818\" href=\"/caterpillar/3005-2818/\" slug=\"caterpillar\">Caterpillar</a>, even the Red Queen herself, as well as the helpful-yet-ever-cryptic <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2813\" href=\"/cheshire-cat/3005-2813/\" slug=\"cheshire-cat\">Cheshire Cat</a>, while also fighting to uncover the truth behind the fire that took her family from her. It's a tale as grim as it is Grimm, and while its pontificating on the fragility of the mind and the stories we tell ourselves to avoid the stickier truths can have an arm-chair navel-gazing quality at times, it works because it takes its subject matter so seriously.</p><p style=\"\">Considering the wretched state of Alice's fractured mind, it stands to reason that its geography would be equally scattered and mazelike, guarded by menagerie of disturbing visions. That notion informs the overall structure of the gameplay in Madness Returns, which, much like its predecessor, splits its time between tricky platform puzzles and combat sequences. Putting Alice's ability to double, and triple-jump, as well as perform a gliding maneuver to full use, the platforming often has an airy quality to it, with Alice flittering from one platform suspended in the ether to another.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">A little exploration, aided by Alice's ability to shrink down and squeeze through hidden keyholes at the push of a button, can net you extra teeth--the game's currency for weapon upgrades--as well as health-replenishing roses, and collectibles like slivers of Alice's own memory. While Alice's mobility is limited in her diminutive form, she's also able to see hidden paths, which contributes to the game's puzzle-solving that often revolves around flipping switches and activating floor panels with specific timing.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9456/1728099-hobbyhorse_crush.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1728099\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9456/1728099-hobbyhorse_crush.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1728099\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9456/1728099-hobbyhorse_crush.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9456/1728099-hobbyhorse_crush.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brute force isn't enough--Alice needs to be smart about how she faces each foe.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The weightlessness of the game's platforming is countered by the brutal impact of the combat. Alice, initially armed with her trusty <a data-ref-id=\"3055-121\" href=\"/vorpal-blade/3055-121/\" slug=\"vorpal-blade\">vorpal blade</a>, and eventually aided by a harder-hitting hobby horse, as well as a pepper grinder and a teapot that serve as ranged weapons, has to use all of her abilities in battle to survive the large groups of varied enemies she must face. Madness Returns tends to be generous with the checkpointing when you're platforming, usually only rolling you back a misguided leap or two, but the combat demands sharp reflexes and a good understanding of which enemies pose the most immediate threat, as well as the best way to exploit the specific weaknesses of each.</p><p style=\"\">The lock-on targeting feels snappy, you're never in danger of accidentally fighting your way right off the edge of a precarious platform, and if you're paying attention, the game is good about providing little cues to let you know if you're actually making a dent. That said, there's a certain sluggishness when trying to switch from one weapon to another, one that's compounded once you have to start using the D-pad to toggle between your two ranged weapons.</p><p style=\"\">Each of the domains visited in Alice's Wonderland has a very specific visual style, and without exception, they are singular and stunning. The Hatter's domain combines the crockery of a mad tea party and the bleak, polluted, monolithic arcitecture of industrial <a data-ref-id=\"3035-212\" href=\"/london/3035-212/\" slug=\"london\">London</a>, while Alice's quest to find the Caterpillar takes her to a misty mountaintop realm where <a data-ref-id=\"3055-554\" href=\"/origami/3055-554/\" slug=\"origami\">origami</a> ant-people are marauded by <a data-ref-id=\"3015-216\" href=\"/samurai/3015-216/\" slug=\"samurai\">samurai</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5772\" href=\"/wasps/3015-5772/\" slug=\"wasps\">wasps</a>--a clear departure of Carroll's original vision, no doubt, but one that's rendered with incredible detail regardless.</p><p style=\"\">While nebulous foes of corrupting black tar and neglected doll parts pursue Alice throughout the game, the enemies specific to each domain feel as at home in these places as young Alice and her ever-changing wardrobe feels out of sorts. For me, Madness Returns is at its best when Alice's sooty reality rubs up against the toadstools and fairytales of Wonderland, something the game wrings for good dramatic effect. This is a game of texture, even when the textures themselves can be muddy at times.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9456/1728098-giant_alice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1728098\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56253474152307\" data-width=\"1799\" style=\"width: 1799px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9456/1728098-giant_alice.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1728098\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9456/1728098-giant_alice.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9456/1728098-giant_alice.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Her challenges are significant, but Alice is far from helpless.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game deviates from its prime gameplay tenets on occasion, presenting the player with sliding puzzles, treacherous downhill slides, and, gratefully, entirely optional rhythm minigames.

This isn't to say that the quality of the gameplay degrades over time, but rather, that the production quality stokes the player's impatiences for some sense of progress beyond making it to the next bit of platforming or combat sequence.

But it also exhibits a surprising lack of polish in several areas, some more integral to the experience than others. It's only because the core gameplay is still so much fun in Infamous 2 that these rough patches stand out as much as they do.</p><p style=\"\">Specifically, it was the fluidly responsive controls and the laundry list of explosive powers that made the first game such a joy. The controls remain apparently unchanged, again allowing superhero <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6399\" href=\"/cole-macgrath/3005-6399/\" slug=\"cole-macgrath\">Cole MacGrath</a> to aim and dodge with the ease and mobility that a superhero should. There's also a generous list of new variations on the game's stable of weapon-like electric powers, which still fall into familiar categories like grenade, rocket, and pea shooter. You can even choose between ice- and fire-related variants on these powers later in the game (by making what feels like a contrived, button-prompted moral decision) that further broadens your arsenal. The expanded lineup of powers is certainly robust enough, and the flow of combat is further streamlined by a handy pop-up menu that lets you cycle through available types of abilities on the fly. The powers are once again split across both sides of the moral coin, and while it felt like the first Infamous taunted my pure-hearted boy scout with a bunch of more entertaining, destructive-looking powers available only to an evil character, this time the game does a better job of assigning some desirable abilities to the good side too.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1697951-5407792758_33b0323431_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1697951\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1697951-5407792758_33b0323431_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1697951\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1697951-5407792758_33b0323431_o.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, Infamous 2 shares its predecessor's predilection for overwhelming you with enemies from all sides. You become so overly powerful in the second half, the game responds by ramping up the number and ferocity of the enemies, but there are a few too many cases where the combat feels cheap. It's just not much fun when you get surrounded by elite soldiers who can slide right up behind you, knock you down with a shotgun, then keep damaging you while you're waiting to climb out of a stun animation and regain control. Liberal checkpoints aren't much consolation when things like that happen two or three times in a row. On the whole it's still a blast to lay waste to hordes of enemies in this game, but you do start to wish the enemy design and placement were as refined as the controls and abilities.</p><p style=\"\">In most games, getting from place to place is just a means to an end, so it says a lot about the first Infamous that simply traversing the urban sprawl was an enjoyable end in itself. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3899\" href=\"/sucker-punch/3010-3899/\" slug=\"sucker-punch\">Sucker Punch</a> has made Cole even more mobile in this sequel, through both new abilities and new environmental features. The \"static thrusters\" that let you make like a flying squirrel will now get you some extra lift, and there's an ice jump--the single best incentive to play a good character, second to satisfying your own conscience--that shoots you straight upward at the touch of a button. Likewise, new electrified vertical rails on most buildings will send you flying skyward as soon as you touch them. The magnetic way that Cole gravitates to things he can cling to or climb on is still much appreciated, but there are the few frustrating instances where he ends up sticking to the wrong grapple point, which ultimately makes it take longer to get where you're going. Like the combat, it's another case where the central idea is so good that you wish the implementation was a bit more refined.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1697942-5407181737_42594d7bf4_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1697942\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1697942-5407181737_42594d7bf4_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1697942\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1697942-5407181737_42594d7bf4_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1697942-5407181737_42594d7bf4_o.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Origin stories are probably the easiest sort of superhero tale to write, and sure enough, Cole's first tentative steps into his new power and responsibility did a great job of buoying and driving the story in the first game. Now that he's a full-fledged hero, Infamous 2 is inherently a little less exciting, sending Cole south to the New Orleans-esque <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3467\" href=\"/new-marais/3035-3467/\" slug=\"new-marais\">New Marais</a> to escape <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15660\" href=\"/the-beast/3005-15660/\" slug=\"the-beast\">the Beast</a>, the towering dervish of destruction foretold in the vision that ended the first game. New Marais is where Cole believes he can seek the origin of the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3659\" href=\"/ray-sphere/3055-3659/\" slug=\"ray-sphere\">ray sphere</a> technology that started all this mess, and thus amplify his powers to the degree necessary to take on the Beast and stop its wanton rampage across the Eastern seaboard.</p><p style=\"\">Every time you start the game and load your save, there's a great framing device that tells you how many miles the Beast has left to travel before it reaches and obliterates New Marais. The Beast's progress is tied to your own progress through the story, so there's no actual timer ticking down, but this still creates a foreboding backdrop behind your local troubles, which are many. An anti-mutant politician called <a data-ref-id=\"3005-19136\" href=\"/joseph-bertrand/3005-19136/\" slug=\"joseph-bertrand\">Bertrand</a> has the city in near-martial lockdown, and mutated swamp freaks are rampaging through some quarters of town. In this already heated mix, Cole and his now-tolerable sidekick <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10861\" href=\"/zeke-dunbar/3005-10861/\" slug=\"zeke-dunbar\">Zeke</a> run up against some other gifted individuals with their own superpowers, and tangle with Bertrand's militia, the monsters, and an elite team of high-tech mercenaries as well. The game does a decent job of humanizing its new characters, but in general there's a little too much going on for the story to find its center. By contrast, I really enjoyed the singular mystique the first Infamous built up around the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10990\" href=\"/kessler/3005-10990/\" slug=\"kessler\">Kessler</a> character and Cole's struggle to understand his new powers and the menace he was fighting. By comparison, the plot here feels a bit scattered. The first game's morality system returns here, and while you generate small amounts of good or bad karma by the way you behave in combat and such, the big story-related moral decisions boil down to fairly contrived freeze-frame button prompts. These choices really only act as gateways to which cutscenes you see and which powers you get to access (and, in a few cases, which missions you have available), though again, I couldn't help picking the good option in every case on my first playthrough.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33759/1723800-infamous_2_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1723800\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2000\" style=\"width: 2000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33759/1723800-infamous_2_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1723800\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33759/1723800-infamous_2_5.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33759/1723800-infamous_2_5.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">At least New Marais is much more visually interesting than the grey grit of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1660\" href=\"/empire-city/3035-1660/\" slug=\"empire-city\">Empire City</a>, not least because it's a pleasure town rife with neon-lined casinos and brothels, and marked by some authentic-looking architecture. More generally, Sucker Punch has also broadened the game's color palette, enriching the game's look with brilliant orange-red sunsets and other elements that make the game more interesting to look at. Best of all, the first game's spotty frame rate has mostly been corrected here, making for a more fluid experience.</p><p style=\"\">In direct contrast to the lovely visual presentation, there's a bizarre lack of sound work in almost every area of the game. Out in the open world you'd expect to hear way more ambient sound than the occasional murmur of a passerby or honking car that's here. Crickets, the rumble of a passing streetcar, the lapping of the water that surrounds the city, even some basic white noise--any and all of those things would have made the world feel busier and more alive, but none of them are consistently there. There's a similar dearth of sound design in places ranging from the abilities menu to major dramatic cutscenes. That might sound like a nitpick, but you don't realize how necessary good sound is until you take some of it away.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33759/1718469-infamous_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1718469\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33759/1718469-infamous_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1718469\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33759/1718469-infamous_2_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33759/1718469-infamous_2_2.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">With a whopping 40 story missions, 60 side missions, hundreds of power-enabling blast shards to collect, and endless minor street crimes to prevent (or commit), Infamous 2 is already chockablock with content. So in a sense, it almost doesn't matter whether the game's user-generated mission framework is actually any good or not. But it is. There's a pretty easy-to-use mission editor in here that lets you work from a template or start with a blank slate to create all kinds of custom missions that focus on combat, physics puzzles, or even basic narrative-driven scenarios. People are already making some pretty elaborate missions, but of course there are also the requisite short obstacle courses designed to quickly net you a bunch of trophies and the requisite recreations of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\" href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" slug=\"super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros.</a>' 1-1. The best part about Infamous 2's user-made content is that you can see as much or as little of it as you want. The game makes it simple to filter which missions show up in your world based on a broad range of criteria, or just disable it all completely. There's already an argument to be made in favor of playing the game through twice on good and evil paths, and since the user missions let you earn karma and experience just like the story ones, their value is evergreen.</p><p style=\"\">Whatever complaints you might make about the ways Infamous 2 could be better, the core of the game is so much fun that it's inarguably worth playing. It's only because the series has so much potential, and already makes good on so much of that potential, that I feel compelled to point out those faults at all. The day we see an Infamous 3 that makes good on everything this series could be, well, that will be an exciting day.</p>", "deck": "It's not quite as refined as you'd expect a sequel to be, but Infamous 2 is still an electrifying good time.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-387/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31150/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/infamous-2/3030-31150/", "id": 31150, "name": "inFamous 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-06-17 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101603/", "id": 101603, "name": "inFamous 2"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/child-of-eden-review/1900-388/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404308-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_037.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404308\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404308-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_037.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404308\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404308-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_037.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">A love letter to the positive potential of technology, humanity's capacity of greatness, synesthasia, and--in perhaps the only constant between all of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1508\" href=\"/q-entertainment/3010-1508/\" slug=\"q-entertainment\">Q?

Never a significant commercial success, and not without significant, meritous criticisms against it, Rez is still an influential and impactful game, blending intricate abstract imagery, cryptic narrative design, and pulsing, rhythmic gameplay in a way a commercial game had never done before it. It was arguably the game that triggered the ever-maddening \"games as art\" black hole of internet debate in earnest, and virtually every abstract, ethereal little sincerely subtitled indie rhythmic shooter since then owes a debt to Rez.

Make no mistake, this game is a feast for the senses--or, perhaps more accurately, an evening spent grinding your molars against an irresponsible amount of fruit-flavored hard candy...for the senses--but it does not push boundaries the way Rez did, and with what amounts to just a few hours of raw, quantifiable gameplay in store, it's kind of a hard sell, perhaps even moreso than the original Rez.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404339-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_061.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404339\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404339-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_061.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404339\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404339-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_061.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">And yet, aside from Rez, there's really nothing quite like the blissed-out soundscapes of Child of Eden.

As a video game, judged alongside other, traditional pieces of interactive electronic entertainment, well, Child of Eden is a little...limited. Let's just say the game part is not its greatest strength. If we're going to cook it down for scrap, Child of Eden is an on-rails shooter with lock-on targeting, the likes of which there are no particularly modern comparisons for, the closest being something like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4535\" href=\"/panzer-dragoon-orta/3030-4535/\" slug=\"panzer-dragoon-orta\">Panzer Dragoon Orta</a>. (<a data-ref-id=\"3010-6415\" href=\"/twisted-pixel-games/3010-6415/\" slug=\"twisted-pixel-games\">Twisted Pixel</a>'s upcoming <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34073\" href=\"/the-gunstringer/3030-34073/\" slug=\"the-gunstringer\">Gunstringer</a> for Kinect is actually shaping up to be a weirdly apt companion to Child of Eden, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here.) You paint enemies with a cursor, hit the trigger, and those enemies are gone. \"Enemies\" almost seems a little strong, since most of the things you're shooting seem kind of ambivalent about the whole affair, though targets that do bite back usually do so with color-coded projectiles that require you to switch to your manual weapon to eliminate.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">You'll find health pick-ups, as well as Euphoria power-ups, which let you clear the screen when you're in a pinch. There are five main levels of unique, effectively static content in Child of Eden, and once you complete all five, you'll unlock a higher difficulty, some sound and visual effects, as well as a challenge mode that goes longer, but is dronier and less theatrical than the main levels. Most levels take, in my experience, a little more than 10 minutes to complete, though the game doles out access to subsequent levels in such a way that you'll likely have to play previous levels multiple times in order to progress.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404362-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_098.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404362\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404362-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_098.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404362\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404362-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_098.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404362-eden_e3_2010_us_h264_360p_098.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Judged purely by this mechanical criteria, Child of Eden sounds lackluster at best. It's short, simple, and frankly, not terribly challenging. What makes Child of Eden worth playing--or, at least experiencing--are the brain-bursting, techno-psychedelic environments that you fly through. Following an opening scroll concerning some very serious nonsense about future ladies being digitized and reborn in the space Internet (I think), you're plunged into one level after another of what are essentially high-concept light shows. The first level feels like the most direct connection to Rez, with complex geometric structures built out of simple polygonal shapes that undulate and transform as the level continues. By the second level you're watching a crystal space whale transform into the mighty phoenix, and the third level...well, the third level takes place on a river, and is called \"Beauty.\" Not sure I could describe it much better than that. The levels only get weirder, and more visually astonishing, from there.</p><p style=\"\">If you couldn't tell already, Child of Eden is an achingly sincere game with a serious case of freshman philosophy. The substance of the game's profundity is wide open to debate, but it's never too overbearing about it, and there's something to be said for trying to divine the creator's intent from the thousands of swirling, flat-shaded cubes currently undulating across your screen.</p><p style=\"\">It's astonishing that Rez would ever receive a sequel, official or otherwise, so the very existence of Child of Eden is kind of incredible.

The original is a game I count among my all-time favorites but which I haven't touched since it was only a few days old. Today, the game holds up remarkably well, all things considered, and by sheer process of elimination it's practically a must-have for anyone who's already ponied up for the software-scarce 3DS.</p><p style=\"\">Ocarina was inarguably a landmark when it released in 1998, and Nintendo has shown the game the right amount of reverence with this updated release.

You'd be forgiven if you took a cursory look at Ocarina 3D and thought it doesn't look much better than the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-43\" href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" slug=\"nintendo-64\">Nintendo 64</a> original, but you'd be objectively wrong. That's just the rose-colored tint of nostalgia. Side by side, the new release looks leaps and bounds better than the old one, particularly the far more detailed character models. The world is full of cleaner, sharper textures and tons of lively new ambient effects as well. Top to bottom, it's a great overhaul. And while every person handles the 3DS' depth feature subjectively, this has been my best experience with the system's 3D to date. Hyrule's wide-open expanses and ornate interiors make a great showcase for the 3D effect, and I was able to play with the 3D slider most of the way up without my eyes ever seriously crossing.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1819064-i_28602.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1819064\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1819064-i_28602.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1819064\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1819064-i_28602.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">In contrast to the thorough graphics upgrade, Ocarina 3D slavishly recreates every other aspect of Ocarina of Time, for better or worse. That's mostly for the better. Even now, over a decade later, the game's dungeons are still the real deal, full of devilish puzzles that challenge you to use the old <a data-ref-id=\"3025-9\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda\">Zelda</a> item lineup in creative ways, intricate multi-level layouts, and no shortage of set pieces and architectural novelties. Remember stepping into the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1004\" href=\"/forest-temple/3035-1004/\" slug=\"forest-temple\">Forest Temple</a>'s twisted hallway for the first time? The passage of time hasn't much dulled the impact of such unexpected sights. Some of the dungeons are so complex, you get that almost overwhelmed feeling akin to the way you feel in games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-588\" href=\"/portal/3025-588/\" slug=\"portal\">Portal</a>, where you have to step back and take it all in from a distance before you can decide how to start going about solving things up close. For a game this old to engender such a modern reaction is pretty impressive.</p><p style=\"\">My prevailing memory of Ocarina focused on the sequence of those iconic dungeons. \"Right... three dungeons as a kid, travel through time, five temples, done.\" But there's a good bit more content, most of it optional, around the edges of Ocarina to flesh out and enliven the game's version of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-13\" href=\"/hyrule/3035-13/\" slug=\"hyrule\">Hyrule</a>. Even having played the game in its day, I found myself stumbling onto some neat secret areas, finding unexpected pieces of heart, and so on, without immediately remembering where everything is. Ocarina of Time was one of the first games I remember that established a strong, coherent sense of place, and you still get a pretty great sense of that larger world as you explore Hyrule. There's plenty of value even for those who have been here before, though you're sure to recall certain things more clearly and immediately than others.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1819072-i_28610.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1819072\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1819072-i_28610.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1819072\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1819072-i_28610.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1819072-i_28610.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Ocarina's position in the video game pantheon is well-deserved, but there are a couple of spots where the age begins to show, where you wish devotion to recreating every aspect of the classic game might have given way to some thoughtful, modern-day refinements. The movement and combat work surprisingly well on the 3DS' controls, with a much appreciated option to toggle the enemy targeting by simply tapping the L button, instead of having to hold it down constantly. But it's hard not to miss the dual-analog camera control that underpins modern third-person action games, and the camera here tends to get hung up in tight spaces and make combat and some navigation a bit frustrating at those times. Also, early on in the game you'll spend an awful lot of time running back and forth across the sprawling Hyrule field, which itself doesn't contain much to occupy your attention. Later on there are enough ways to warp between locations this isn't much of an issue, and besides, I remember thinking the field felt a little empty way back in 1998 as well. There are probably fewer moments here where you remember this is an old game than there are in practically any other game of the era, but they do pop up.</p><p style=\"\">Since this is, ultimately, a nice new coat of paint on the same game that came out last century, Nintendo's other few enhancements to Ocarina 3D bear mentioning. If you feel driven to go back and fight the game's bosses from a menu with a timer, you can do that. It's great that the game also offers the much harder <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17278\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-master-quest/3030-17278/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-master-quest\">Master Quest</a> once you've completed the game the first time. There are some neat hint videos that apply to just about every area of the game, though none of them explicitly hold your hand through all of the puzzles. The best addition, besides the new graphics, is a pair of extra buttons on the touch screen that supplement the normal face buttons and let you map a couple of extra items. Even boots. (That means navigating the infamous <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1002\" href=\"/water-temple/3035-1002/\" slug=\"water-temple\">Water Temple</a> is as easy as tapping a button, rather than navigating multiple menus every time you want to access those infernal boots.) And while gyroscope-based motion control for aiming originally seemed like a bad idea to me, it actually comes in handy for precisely aiming projectile items like the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-383\" href=\"/hook-shot/3055-383/\" slug=\"hook-shot\">hookshot</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-73\" href=\"/bow/3055-73/\" slug=\"bow\">bow</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1819071-i_28609.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1819071\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1819071-i_28609.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1819071\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1819071-i_28609.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1819071-i_28609.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">There are surely 3DS owners out there for whom Ocarina of Time 3D will be their first experience with one of the few classics important enough to truly earn the word \"seminal.\" Those people should by all means stop what they're doing and go get this game.

It's almost as important as a historical record as it is a game that's still enjoyable today.</p><p style=\"\">For everyone else, your interest in this game should hinge on your interest in replaying a better-looking 3D version of Ocarina of Time, and unless you've replayed the old game to death in the recent past, this updated release serves as the best version to hold onto for posterity.

I'm not adding that for effect. He calls himself that a lot.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Okay, so maybe Shadows of the Damned isn't quite the out-of-left-field product of unchecked creativity some of us might have initially wanted from this particular supergroup. In fact, on the supergroup scale, it's more like that one Temple of the Dog album, a concept that might be completely within the usual wheelhouse of everyone involved, but is still a damn good example of what these guys have repeatedly proven themselves capable of. It's a game full of viscerally satisfying shooting, plenty of blood and guts, a totally off-kilter storyline, and some legitimately excellent audio running underneath the surface. It's a known quantity, but one that feels almost as high as the pedigree that spawned it.</p><p style=\"\">Shadows of the Damned tells the tortured tale of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16583\" href=\"/garcia-hotspur/3005-16583/\" slug=\"garcia-hotspur\">Garcia Hotspur</a>, a preternaturally badass demon hunter who finds himself running up against one severely pissed off pervert demon named Fleming, who hasn't taken too kindly to Garcia's chosen profession. Garcia returns home after a particularly rough night of demon-slaying to find his special lady dangling from a noose, and Fleming in possession of her soul. Fleming, cutting to the chase, makes repeated threats to defile Garcia's lady in ways that would make <a data-ref-id=\"3005-656\" href=\"/duke-nukem/3005-656/\" slug=\"duke-nukem\">Duke Nukem</a>'s exploits seem puritanical by comparison. Thoroughly in love and totally irritated by this inconvenience, Garcia leaps into Hell to save his beloved, and perhaps murder a few \"hell monkeys\" in the process.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Before we go any further, a note of import: right from the get-go, you're probably going to hate Garcia a little bit. His personality seems equally lifted from <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5062\" href=\"/john-constantine/3005-5062/\" slug=\"john-constantine\">John Constantine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/el-mariachi/15-1146/\" rel=\"nofollow\">El Mariachi</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12455\" href=\"/jack-burton/3005-12455/\" slug=\"jack-burton\">Jack Burton</a>, and he has all the cheesy one-liners and moments of broody extremeness such a description comes encumbered with. That hate won't last, fortunately.</p><p style=\"\">It's just that Shadows of the Damned takes a little while to find its groove. Suda51's sense of humor is a... divisive thing. You're either on board with his anarchistic, abstract sensibilities, or you're all the way not. At first, it feels like the game is challenging you to keep playing, what with its opening salvo of lame dick jokes and spine-crinkling one-liners. But bit by bit, the story begins to boil, and actual charm begins to spill out. Not long after Garcia enters Hell, the game morphs into a kind of weird buddy comedy, with Garcia facing increasingly bizarre circumstances that Johnson, his British-accented, flaming skull of a sidekick (who also happens to take the form of Garcia's demon-slaying gun) is more than happy to try and explain in his cowardly genial way.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122378/1708885-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1708885\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122378/1708885-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1708885\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122378/1708885-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Johnson is like Portal 2's Wheatley, except a flaming skull instead of a robot. It's arguable which is cooler.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's a peculiar chemistry to Garcia and Johnson that carries the game and its oddball story along. The actors voicing the pair certainly deserve a lot of the credit, but Suda, along with his script translator, each deserve quite a bit, too. For all the profanely adolescent humor the game contains, there's also a shocking amount of nuance to it. There's a pace and a flow to the story that, contrary to some of Suda's other works, doesn't feel like it's punching you in the face with nonstop, hyperactive nonsense. For every puerile piece of dick-related innuendo and weird bit of Internet culture nudge-and-winkery, there are as many moments of creative comedic storytelling that actually surprise you. For instance, try checking out one of the several storybooks randomly scattered throughout the game, and listen as Johnson and/or Garcia read aloud the demented back story of one of the game's many boss demons. These sequences stop the game dead in its tracks, and yet the writing and acting is so sharp that you won't even care.</p><p style=\"\">Which isn't to say you won't care about the action; just that you might not care quite as much. As a shooter, Shadows of the Damned is largely serviceable, though it periodically flirts with brilliance. The game's third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective feels loosely assembled from Mikami's design work on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\" href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" slug=\"resident-evil-4\">Resident Evil 4</a>, except with the added bonus of being able to move and shoot at the same time. Revolutionary, right?</p><p style=\"\">The word for the combat is, \"satisfying.\" The guns aren't overly thrilling, but the damage they cause is nice and disgusting. Blood, guts, and other, inexplicable grossness fly in great quantities, and the demons, while not the most creatively designed hellspawn you've ever seen, at least do you the service of suffering pleasurably. You've only a handful of gun types to play with, but as you progress, you'll gain access to a nutty array of Johnson upgrades that deal quite a bit of gruesome damage to the various demonic forces out to get you.</p><p style=\"\">Even the boss battles, often the Achilles heel of these sorts of action games, are an enticement. Though they rarely transcend the usual pattern-focused battle mechanics we've all played to death, they're nonetheless creatively designed, well-paced battles that only periodically frustrate. If you can't appreciate the act of fighting a man with the head of a goat riding a horse with the head of a man, I don't think Shadows of the Damned is the game for you.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122378/1708888-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1708888\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122378/1708888-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1708888\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122378/1708888-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_10.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122378/1708888-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_10.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can't see it, but that guy has a harmonica permanently affixed to his face. It's like if Clive Barker wrote Deliverance.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">For the most part, Shadows of the Damned is a game that qualifies as challenging, not frustrating. Occasional bouts with irritating arena battles featuring insane droves of enemies notwithstanding, the game's design mostly allows for a breezy, if not easy shooting experience, thanks in no small part to the mostly solid checkpoint system. The one wrinkle in the gameplay that occasionally vexes is the \"darkness\" mechanic. In the vein of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-356\" href=\"/silent-hill/3025-356/\" slug=\"silent-hill\">Silent Hill</a>, Hell will sometimes go massively, oppressively dark, turning everything to a chaotic bluish hue and actually inflicting damage on Garcia.</p><p style=\"\">These sequences usually involve finding light sources to blast with your gun, or darkness-barfing zombie hands to destroy. It's rarely too difficult to find the right solution, though that does bring up the matter of the game's puzzles, or general lack thereof. Shadows of the Damned is a linear game. Linear is not inherently a damnable term, but here it very much is. This is not a game that requires much thought. When a door is locked, an icon on the door tells you what you need to do. Sometimes you blast it with light. Sometimes you kick it in. Sometimes you have to go find a strawberry for a demonic baby head that acts as a lock. If you do have to go do something like find a strawberry for a demonic baby head, that strawberry is usually pretty close to the demonic baby head, possibly in that one other accessible room right next to the demonic baby head.</p><p style=\"\">In other words, there just isn't much need for brainpower in Shadows of the Damned. Mostly it's all run-and-gun demon-splattering, which for many will be just fine. What you might be less fine with is some of the game's rougher edges. Some of these are technical, including a few irritating glitches that forced me to restart a couple of checkpoints, and some long-ish loading times that periodically pop up and cause initial choppiness with cutscenes. Other issues are atmospheric in nature. While Hell should certainly be an ugly place, a lot of Shadows of the Damned's environments are drawn up in strangely bland fashion. Hell is basically a nondescript European city peppered with hollowed-out corpses and gooey human viscera. The latter gore actually looks pretty good, but much of the world detail is uncreative and overly dank. The notion of Hell as a rather dull community of demons wandering around torturing each other out of a lack of better options is kind of a funny one, but as a visual gag, it just serves to make the game's presentation less interesting.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122378/1708884-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1708884\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122378/1708884-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1708884\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122378/1708884-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122378/1708884-shadows_of_the_damned_screen_6.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The shooting can feel a little loose, but blowing up these demonic scumbags is rarely dull.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Still, there are some amusing artistic touches. The demon who acts as your weapon salesman, for instance, looks like a giant, hulking Wendigo with a fondness for flood lights, and also talks like Gomer Pyle. Again, a lot of what works in Shadows of the Damned comes from the audio, especially in the campy, bizarre voice acting. Yamaoka's music deserves special mention, too. He runs the gamut from the ethereal to the cacophonous here, mixing dirges of grindcore screeching with dread-filled strings, and finding the occasional opportunity to toss in some Spanish guitar solos for good measure. It's ludicrous stuff, but it perfectly suits its ludicrous game.</p><p style=\"\">Some are guaranteed to hate Shadows of the Damned. It's unapologetically immature, boner-obsessed, and grotesquely violent. And yet, unlike other unapologetically immature, boner-obsessed, and grotesquely violent games of recent memory, there is no meanness of spirit to Shadows' intentions. Practically every gag in the game seems to come from a place of easygoing silliness, rather than a need for forced edginess. For a game about Hell and damnation, it's remarkably fluffy and light of spirit, to the point where you just can't help but laugh at the wanton stupidity of it all.

The games have been short, solid, and sharp-witted. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34304\" href=\"/trenched/3030-34304/\" slug=\"trenched\">Trenched</a> keeps the same comic sensibility that you've come to expect from these releases, but the game that backs everything up is an exciting-but-brief piece of multiplayer action that feels well-balanced and reasonably deep. While it could be a bit better at exploiting that depth, Trenched is a great mix of funny and fun mech combat that's great while it lasts.</p><p style=\"\">The story is that two soldiers, manning a communications outpost after receiving wartime injuries, stumbled onto some kind of mysterious broadcast that made them super-smart. With newfound abilities at their disposal, one went and invented \"mobile trenches,\" which is a silly word for \"<a data-ref-id=\"3055-21\" href=\"/mech/3055-21/\" slug=\"mech\">mech</a>,\" and the other went the dark route and became obsessed with spreading the broadcast to the world. Vlad, the evil one, makes monsters out of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-54\" href=\"/television/3055-54/\" slug=\"television\">televisions</a> screens called Monovisions, and the different types of monos make up the enemies you face while piloting your trench, dropping turrets, and protecting various targets.</p><p style=\"\">Most of the 15 missions in Trenched are defensive in nature, which is where the comparisons to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-413\" href=\"/tower-defense/3015-413/\" slug=\"tower-defense\">tower defense</a> games come in. There are one to three structures in each level that you must defend from wave after wave of enemies. Your first line of defense is probably your trench itself, which can be customized with various weapons, chassis, legs, and so on. Outfitting machine guns onto your trench gives you a pretty direct way to impact the enemy, but in some cases, you'll want shotguns, or perhaps large sniper cannons or gigantic artillery guns are more your speed. Trench customization is key to your success in each mission, and the game gives you helpful tips about the things you'll need to win.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1723410-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1723410\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1723410-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1723410\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1723410-01.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">One of the other ways to customize your trench is to pick which emplacements you'll take into battle with you. These are various turrets that you can plop down just about anywhere on the map. Most of them are pretty straightforward. Shotgun turrets take out ground-based enemies, flak turrets watch the skies, and machine guns can handle both. Sniper turrets and minelayers give you some additional weapon-type turrets to bring out, when you need something a little extra. There are also support turrets, such as dampeners that slow down enemies when they enter the turret's range. This sets up the classic tower defense strategy of slowing enemies down so that your emplacements can really pound on them while you mop up the rest with your mech's weapons.</p><p style=\"\">It's certainly possible to play Trenched by yourself, but it's better with others. Up to four players can get into the game at once via Xbox Live, and once you get comfortable with the weapons and know what to expect out of the levels, an experienced team of players can clean up without taking much, if any damage along the way. As you play, you'll gain experience and collect loot, giving you a reason to revisit levels, but you'll probably hit the highest level--10--after six hours or so. This doesn't mean you'll have access to every part, though, so if you're a completist, you still might find plenty of reasons to keep playing Trenched's levels again and again, because the various weapons and loot you get is usually great. It's also where most of the game's comedy is found. Trenched does the \"clever item descriptions\" thing exceptionally well, even managing to throw in a trio of wonderful <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13185\" href=\"/violent-j/3005-13185/\" slug=\"violent-j\">Insane Clown Posse</a> gags along the way.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The items themselves are worth checking out, too. The game does well with stats, letting you see things like range and damage for all the different weapons while you're building your trench. But some weapons also come with additional effects, leading to machine guns that also emit flak to make them more effective against aerial targets. Or artillery shells that hit the ground and cause area of effect damage for a few seconds after impact. Or shotguns that shoot slugs, turning them into smaller sniper rifles for chassis that can't handle the big guns. You'll also get upgraded chassis as you play, giving you more armor and a variety of types that almost serve as classes. The engineering chassis only have a couple of weapon slots, but can take more turret types into battle. Assault chassis, on the other hand, let you load up with weapons, but you'll only get a couple of weaker turret types to take with you.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1723411-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1723411\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1723411-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1723411\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1723411-02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1723411-02.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">The game also dabbles in social elements by putting your recent teammates into a regiment. Between missions, you'll get updates on the stats that your regiment has put together, and some unlockable items and challenges hinge on meeting certain regiment goals. Also, between missions, you can run around the deck of a ship and salute each other like crazy. You can dress your marine in different clothing, and the hats confer different saluting animations. It's the right kind of goofy inclusion that feeds in just a little bit more charm.</p><p style=\"\">The downfall of Trenched is that you unlock all of this great stuff, but don't have a ton of opportunities to face tough opposition once you get to the end. The lower levels are a breeze once you've unlocked better gear, and most of them are built in such a way that you want to take specific things into each mission, rather than just loading up with the most savage gear you've got and laying waste to everything. Also, the menus that you use to customize your trench aren't so good, so changing out your chassis, legs, and weapons between each mission takes a little longer than it probably needs to. Once you get used to its particular quirks, it's not a huge deal. Also, the game's frame rate can get a little rough when you've got four players shooting off weapons at the same time.</p><p style=\"\">For something that sounds like such a simple combination of existing genres, Trenched comes together surprisingly well, and it's the way it plays and controls that makes it all work. Shredding the different enemies with your varied arsenal is quite satisfying. It'd be a thin experience if you were looking for something to play by yourself, but if you like to just saddle up with friends and blast things apart, Trenched is a strong download.</p>", "deck": "Though some aspects of it are short-lived, there are enough great multiplayer moments in Trenched to make it worth your while.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-391/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-34304/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/iron-brigade/3030-34304/", "id": 34304, "name": "Iron Brigade"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-06-22 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-111190/", "id": 111190, "name": "Trenched"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fear-3-review/1900-392/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/124796/1716278-rcp901.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1716278\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/124796/1716278-rcp901.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1716278\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/124796/1716278-rcp901.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">If <a data-ref-id=\"3025-181\" href=\"/fear/3025-181/\" slug=\"fear\">F.E.A.R.</a> were a movie franchise, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30484\" href=\"/fear-3/3030-30484/\" slug=\"fear-3\">F.E.A.R. 3</a> would be the direct-to-video sequel.

Rather than focusing on enhancing and exploring the stark atmosphere and high-tech tactics that has defined F.E.A.R. thus far, Day 1 seems more interested in incorporating elements from brand-name shooters like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-405\" href=\"/killzone/3025-405/\" slug=\"killzone\">Killzone</a>, adding features without adding value.

Notably, the situations F.E.A.R. 3 puts you in just feel shopworn. There are a few sequences where you'll pilot powerful-if-trudging mechs, something that F.E.A.R. 2 did, and did better, but it's a lot of flavorless corridor crawling while peeking out from behind crates, punctuated by what are essentially wave-based survival encounters. Separate from the story, F.E.A.R. 3 has a handful of multiplayer modes that, at this point, shouldn't surprise you to learn feel an awful lot like the wave-based survival modes found in games like Call of Duty and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War</a>. Even the promisingly titled \"Fucking Run\" mode, where you have to chew through enemies while trying to outrun a constantly looming wall of death, is better in theory.</p><p style=\"\">Uninspired combat scenarios and misguided cooperative elements aside, the biggest tragedy in F.E.A.R. 3 is that it's simply not scary, spooky, unnerving, or even a little bit surprising. Jump-scares and weird visions come predictably, though Alma is apparently too preoccupied to provide those very often. The game feels impatient, unwilling to allow any tension to build, constantly pushing you forward into the next firefight. I feel like it's incredibly telling that, in addition to a number of combat challenges that can earn you enhanced character abilities, each chapter has a pace time for you to beat. It's a point that tells players \"don't worry about the mood, just run as fast as you can!\" and it's a notion that's anathema to the spirit of F.E.A.R.. F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 felt deliberately cinematic, but F.E.A.R. 3 goes in the exact opposite direction, and the naked gaminess robs it of any weight. That lack of weight extends to the game's look, which softens the shadowy, high-contrast feel and caricatures the characters, furthering a safer, cartoony feel, however gory it might be.</p><p style=\"\">Whether you preferred the original F.E.A.R. or its sequel, F.E.A.R. 3 plays to the strengths of neither, almost feeling like a multiplayer spin-off that was begrudgingly upgraded to full-on sequel.

The Mercenaries strips out the traditional Resident Evil story structure in favor of an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7057\" href=\"/arena/3015-7057/\" slug=\"arena\">arena-based</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-260\" href=\"/high-score/3015-260/\" slug=\"high-score\">score-focused</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1297\" href=\"/survival/3015-1297/\" slug=\"survival\">survival</a> mode. Players will come to blows with hordes of Resident Evil 4 and 5’s not-zombies, trying to rack up as many kills as possible within the time limit. To maximize one’s score potential, players must quickly kill enemies in succession to build and extend a kill <a data-ref-id=\"3015-18\" href=\"/combo/3015-18/\" slug=\"combo\">combo</a> throughout the match. Completing certain score milestones will unlock the usage of additional playable characters, complete with unique weapon sets, which can impact the ways in which you can take down enemies. In contrast to the typical Resident Evil experience, The Mercenaries is more akin to an arcade game, focusing on playing and replaying short levels to obtain high scores.</p><p style=\"\">Console-to-handheld ports can be tricky, and rife with control compromises, but The Mercs 3D makes the jump to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-117\" href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" slug=\"nintendo-3ds\">3DS</a> with relative ease, thanks to the fact that the modern Resident Evil games are built around single analog stick controls. Movement and turning is mapped to the circle pad, holding the R button brings up your weapon sights for aiming (and, in RE tradition, locks you in place) and the face buttons are used for shooting and utilizing context sensitive prompts. While the top 3DS screen displays the core action, the bottom screen serves as a quick-select inventory screen, allowing players to quickly switch between weapons, reload guns and use healing items.</p><p style=\"\">In perhaps its most notable advance, The Mercenaries 3D finally brings the RE games in line with more modern third-person shooters with an alternate control scheme that allows players to move and shoot at the same time. In this mode, the circle disc will handle movement and strafing while the four face buttons are used for aiming (similar to the way shooters have been adapted on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" slug=\"psp\">PSP</a>). It's not a perfect substitute for a second analog stick, but that’s the price you have to pay in order to bring a little modernity to RE. The Mercenaries 3D plays about as well as the series’ console counterparts, with very little of the gameplay nuances sacrificed in the translation.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1809443-resident_evil_the_mercenaries_3d_nintendo_3ds_1307367352_121.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1809443\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1809443-resident_evil_the_mercenaries_3d_nintendo_3ds_1307367352_121.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1809443\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1809443-resident_evil_the_mercenaries_3d_nintendo_3ds_1307367352_121.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Even on the 3DS, Chris Redfield has monstrous guns.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The problem with The Mercenaries 3D, however, has to do with the content. Specifically, there isn’t enough of it. All eight of the game's maps come directly from Resident Evil 4 or 5, and these aren’t full Resident Evil campaign levels, complete with the some of the best interactive cutscenes, set pieces, and boss fights found in modern action games. These are small, corridor-heavy maps that don’t last more than three to six minutes. The only noteworthy addition to The Mercenaries 3D is the skill system, a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1258\" href=\"/modern-warfare/3025-1258/\" slug=\"modern-warfare\">Modern Warfare</a>-style perk structure where players can take up to three passive enhancements into each match. The skills level up as you accrue skill points from completing rounds, but the bonuses aren't so impactful as to dramatically affect your chances of success in-game. It's not long before you’ve exhausted the few available maps on the cart, and if you've ever played those Mercenaries modes before, you'll be familiar with virtually all of the content in this game.</p><p style=\"\">As if to add insult to injury, you won’t actually get full access to the eight maps and eight playable characters when you start the game for the first time. Instead, players will be forced to complete a series of missions so disjointed that it does injustice to the word “<a data-ref-id=\"3015-4011\" href=\"/campaign/3015-4011/\" slug=\"campaign\">campaign</a>.” There is zero context for these missions, so if you’re playing through the campaign, you’d better <i>really</i> love Resident Evil’s combat.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The missions are almost all identical, and they don’t necessarily do the best job in instructing you how to deal with enemies or move effectively through the map. The only significant departures from the core Mercenaries gameplay are a penultimate boss fight against the Popokarimu bat monster from Resident Evil 5 and a final boss fight against... that bat monster again. That the game actually runs a full, unskippable credit sequence after the second bat boss fight feels like some kind of cruel, miserable joke. The whole campaign can be completed in less than two hours and and amounts to little more than a slog through soulless, boring content. The campaign problems are further emphasized by an awkward menu structure that makes progressing through missions more of a hassle than it should be.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/125705/1779939-457_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1779939\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/125705/1779939-457_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1779939\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/125705/1779939-457_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/125705/1779939-457_2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rebecca Chambers, as you might imagine, starts each match with extra herbs.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The series’ high quality visuals haven't had the smoothest translation to the 3DS. Capcom’s MT Framework engine recreates the environments, character models, and effects of the past two console RE games onto the platform, and some assets have made that transition better than others. Character models for the playable Mercenaries, the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1078\" href=\"/ganado/3015-1078/\" slug=\"ganado\">Ganados</a> cultists, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2356\" href=\"/majini/3015-2356/\" slug=\"majini\">Majini</a> infected look sharp with striking animation and detailed texture work. Mercs 3D also utilizes the 3DS' stereoscopic visuals to good use with a pronounced-but-not-overwhelming depth enhancement that I was happy to leave on as I played the game. Textures in the actual environments, however, can appear blurry and muddled (not unlike the RE4 port to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">PS2</a>). The game's weirdest visual quirk, however is its habit of cutting out frames of animation on enemies in the distance. Enemies move stiffly until they cross some determined point in the environment relative to the player, upon which their animation fills out the missing frames.</p><p style=\"\">The sound design fares even worse than the visuals. The Mercenaries 3D features plenty of music tracks and effects from the other Resident Evil games and those sound fine, but the vocals--from both Mercs and not-zombies-- feature some of the lowest quality sound recording I've heard in any modern video game. Though the low-bit rate recordings of the vocals may have been a result of low storage space, the vocals in Mercs 3D sounds like bad digitized voice circa the early 90's. It's awful stuff.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1785502-4ff3ee0858b2117afa3bb7b7b087b79e.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1785502\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.72985781990521\" data-width=\"633\" style=\"width: 633px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1785502-4ff3ee0858b2117afa3bb7b7b087b79e.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1785502\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1785502-4ff3ee0858b2117afa3bb7b7b087b79e.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1785502-4ff3ee0858b2117afa3bb7b7b087b79e.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Not even Barry Burton's rugged beard can salvage this game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The Mercenaries 3D also ships with local and online co-op, allowing you to team up and work together on maximizing your scores. Like much of Mercs 3D, the online functionality is identical to that found in RE5, though, like the visuals, it hasn't arrived without problems. In testing the game, lag issues popped up sporadically, resulting in enemies teleporting to new positions in order to catch up, as well as enemies taking too long to register bullet collision and death. In a game mode entirely based around skillful weapon and ammo management, watching ammo wasted on enemies that have already died can seriously mangle your strategy and timing. On stable connections, the feature is functional, but if you’re looking for online co-op versions of The Mercenaries, you should go back to play Resident Evil 5.</p><p style=\"\">And that’s the reaction I come back to over and over again as I played through Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D. If I wanted to play the Mercenaries game mode, why would I pay $40 for this handheld version when I could ostensibly get both Resident Evil 4 and 5 for way less? The gameplay in Mercs 3D has been competently recreated on the handheld, but it’s all to recreate an experience that is done (mostly) better and way cheaper on other platforms. Not to mention the fact that both of those games come with supreme single-player campaigns. If you’ve never played the modern Resident Evil games, you could pick up both Resident Evil 4 and 5 for less than the price of this cart. And if you have already played Resident Evil, the only worthwhile additions in Mercs 3D are portability, a present-yet-inessential skill system and the opportunity to play as several characters who have never been in a modern RE game--hardly $40 worth of additions. Even on a platform suffering a from a drought of software, The Mercenaries 3D still feels like a bad deal. It’s simply too much money for too little original content.</p>", "deck": "Even the most devoted fans of the Mercenaries mode from the modern Resident Evil games will be ill-served by this insubstantial and expensive cash-in.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-393/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32811/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil-the-mercenaries-3d/3030-32811/", "id": 32811, "name": "Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2011-06-30 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-109745/", "id": 109745, "name": "Resident Evil: Mercenaries 3D"}, "reviewer": "Matt"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/lucha-fury-review/1900-394/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-31941\" href=\"/lucha-fury/3030-31941/\" slug=\"lucha-fury\">Lucha Fury</a> is a terrible beat-'em up.

Imagine a game that makes every rookie mistake a beat-'em-up can make--lousy combat, braindead enemies, uninteresting characters, clunky cooperative play, miserable music--and then stop imagining it. Lucha Fury is all of that, and some other nonsense you wouldn't even normally think of.</p><p style=\"\">Perhaps the developers at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7007\" href=\"/punchers-impact/3010-7007/\" slug=\"punchers-impact\">Punchers Impact</a> were just so enamored with their concept of wacky luchadores beating up other wacky luchadores that nobody stopped to think about <i>why</i> they were doing any of this. The sheer allure of colorfully silly men and women in ludicrous wrestling masks running around and punching each other was more than enough to set this whole thing in motion. Too bad it wasn't enough to actually create an even remotely enjoyable game.</p><p style=\"\">Lucha Fury grates right from the get-go, with a nonsensical opening cutscene that gives way to a combat system that immediately informs you that you've made a terrible purchase. Controls are sluggish, unresponsive, and further hobbled by sometimes glitchy animations that don't quite hit their mark. Not an issue, mind you, given that enemies are morons. The default dumbasses literally stand still and flail their arms at you. That's their on-purpose default attack. After that, yes, things become slightly more challenging, but it's usually easy enough to clear wide swaths of bad guys just by wandering up and hammering on the X button.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">There is an upgradable combo system in the game, but its purpose is elusive. With the exception of a few enemies who are best dispatched via a grapple attack or two, there are few reasons to ever worry about any of the extra moves. More often, you'll be too busy taking your hands off the attack buttons to jiggle the right control stick when you're stunned. Yes, you can't recover from a heavy attack unless you flail the right stick for several seconds. That's precisely as awkward and unnecessary as it sounds.</p><p style=\"\">Some beat-'em-ups can suffer troubled fighting mechanics if they offer up enough personality, or, at the very least, a few memorable boss fights. Lucha Fury has none of these things. There is a story of some fashion, and the characters are presumed to have personalities, but you will care none at all about these things. Despite colorful appearances and misshapen forms designed for maximum wacky factor, the on-screen action offers a shocking dearth of excitement. The bosses occasionally offer up a creative design or two, but the fights range between \"over in a couple of seconds\" and \"laboriously long and drawn out.\"</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90792/1822130-l7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1822130\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90792/1822130-l7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1822130\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90792/1822130-l7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The visuals are sharp, but the action never, ever pops.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You can't even play Lucha Fury with your friends online. Co-op play is limited to offline, and drop-in/drop-out play simply doesn't exist. If you're the sort to force your friends to suffer through terrible games alongside you, you'll have to do it in the same space, and they won't be able to leave the game. Unless they just get up and leave, I guess.</p><p style=\"\">It's all quite a shame, because Punchers Impact at least made a game that looks pretty good. The graphics are sharp, bright, and full of nifty cartoonish scenery. Still, good graphics on an abysmal game are little more than a terrible waste. It's like painting a killer racing stripe on a rusted over Corvair... that's on fire.</p><p style=\"\">Maybe as some kind of postmodern commentary on the nostalgia we, the longtime players of video games, hold for the admittedly simplistic and sometimes overly revered beat-'em-up genre, Lucha Fury is an effective tool. I know it certainly made me question whether I had simply been viewing these games through rose-colored glasses all these years, and that in truth, all beat-'em-ups are really this terrible. Then I went and played Final Fight again, and was reassured that no, old beat-'em-ups are fine.

Final Form infuse Jamestown with precisely the right mix of nostalgic good feelings and original mechanics to make it stand out as far more than just another genre also-ran.</p><p style=\"\">Much of Jamestown's immediate appeal comes from its setting. Set on 17th-century <a data-ref-id=\"3035-4\" href=\"/mars/3035-4/\" slug=\"mars\">Mars</a>--don't ask questions, just go with it--you play as Raleigh, a condemned criminal who travels to the British colony of Roanoke...on Mars. There, you find a world ravaged by war between the Red Coats and a terrifying army of futuristic ships and tentacled aliens controlled by an insidious Spanish Conquistador.</p><p style=\"\">This is all told through a mix of pixelated cutscenes and surprisingly detailed background art. Jamestown employs a legitimately attractive 2D art style, full of cool-looking sprites and explosive effects that rival some of the old arcade greats. More to the point though, it invokes the bizarre storyline without getting too wordy about it. The few cutscenes there are move quickly to get you into the action, but the in-game graphics do a fine job of maintaining the peculiar hodgepodge of 17th-century futurism. From the game's opening moments, you're already seeing Red Coat soldiers firing muskets at laser-firing ships and alien grotesqueries. It's bananas, but in the best way possible.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Where Jamestown really shines is in its gameplay. On the surface, the game offers up a fairly standard style of top-down shooting, with a variety of ship types that each come with different weaponry. Enemies deliver the typical brand of bullet hell challenge as well, barfing difficult-to-dodge dots at you in varying quantities.</p><p style=\"\">However, there's a great deal more depth here than meets the initial eye, thanks largely to the cleverly designed \"vaunt\" system. As you defeat enemies, you collect gold trinkets from their exploded wreckage, which in turn fills up your vaunt meter. Once it's filled, the vaunt mechanic does a number of things: it gives off a temporary bullet shield that turns you momentarily invincible, raises the power of your weaponry by a factor of two, and also doubles the score for each defeated enemy. As the meter drains, you can keep it going by collecting more gold, or even terminate it early to generate a second temporary invincibility shield.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/1807108-jamestown_scrn__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807108\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1728\" style=\"width: 1728px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/1807108-jamestown_scrn__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807108\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4344/1807108-jamestown_scrn__2_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>They don't call it 'bullet hell' for nothin'.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This adds quite a bit of complexity to what is otherwise a reasonably straightforward shooter, especially once you start playing in co-op. Up to four players can jump in at once, and in co-op, the vaunt system uses a bit of a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">Rock Band</a>-inspired stacking system, where each player that activates their vaunt stacks the scoring one multiplier higher. It's crazy fun, though it is somewhat limited by the lack of online play. Still, if you've got a few friends and a few gamepads handy, you'll have a blast.</p><p style=\"\">Jamestown is also somewhat limited in content. Like the classics of the arcade, there are only a handful of levels to play through. However, each level features five different difficulty levels, and some of the later levels can only be unlocked after defeating earlier levels on higher settings.

(I mean sex.)</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It never happens. For the entirety of its couple-of-hours-long campaign, Dead Block refuses to evolve past its initial impression. It is a game in which you do the exact same thing over and over and over for a handful of levels. You gain new items, you equip new weapons, and you fight new enemies. But the fundamental nature of the game remains staunchly constant: You break stuff, you build zombie traps, and you item hunt. You keep doing this until the game is over, or you have had your fill. Odds are, you'll have your fill very quickly.</p><p style=\"\">In the game, you are presented with three playable characters: The <a href=\"http://www.officialvillagepeople.com/david.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">construction worker</a> from the Village People, the <a href=\"http://randomfunnypicture.com/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/the-fat-kid-from-up.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">fat kid from <i>Up</i></a>, and <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/foxy-brown/15-9242/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foxy Brown</a> in a crossing guard uniform. Each character has their own particular strengths and weaknesses when it comes to searching for things, destroying objects, and fighting off zombie hordes. They also have their own unique traps they can set for zombies, ranging from a precariously placed nuclear bomb to a bucket of human excrement that hurts zombies for some reason.</p><p style=\"\">You can fight the zombies in Dead Block, but that's not really the point, and that's good, because the combat is clunky and terrible. Rather, you're meant to find all the various points of entry that zombies might use to infiltrate whatever base of operations you're in, and stop them using blockades and traps. You gain the materials needed to build these traps by destroying furniture and other objects throughout the environment, and searching through boxes, packages, cases, and globes for other useful items.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">You can also get wood for blockades by breaking toilets, but perhaps it's best if we just leave that one alone. Anyway, once you collect enough resources, you can plop a blockade or a trap down in any windowsill or door frame. The strategy is in trying to manage the waves of zombies breaking through. A few at a time is fairly manageable, but the more that pour in, the more hectic things tend to get. If you plan poorly, you'll have a whole horde of undead backing you into a corner. If you plot correctly, you'll be able to rummage through the various credenzas and cacti that hold the items which you seek with only minimal molestation.</p><p style=\"\">What are you looking for besides resources, you ask? Oddly enough, guitar equipment. Someone on Dead Block's design team has a real hard-on for rockabilly, it seems. Apart from a soundtrack by Danish rockabilly act <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/vampyrestatebuilding\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vampyre State Building</a> (whose same two songs play at the outset and outro of <i>every level),</i> the game uses the central conceit of <i><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/mars-attacks/16-178844/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mars Attacks!</a></i> that music will kill invading interlopers. Here, rock-and-roll guitar played at full volume is all you need to explode some zombie heads. In order to make that happen, you have to find a guitar, an amp, and a speaker. These are hidden throughout each level, sometimes in suitcases, sometimes in cow skulls. Again, don't ask.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1828297-dead_block_playstation_3_ps3_1304619826_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1828297\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1828297-dead_block_playstation_3_ps3_1304619826_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1828297\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1828297-dead_block_playstation_3_ps3_1304619826_003.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of the methods of zombie death provide minor amusement, but you run out of new methods pretty quick.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Where Dead Block ultimately falls apart is in its refusal to evolve these tasks. Every stage is a foregone conclusion. You know that any nearby window will allow zombies in. You know what to break and what to search through. Almost immediately, the game begins recycling these concepts to the point of abject tedium. You'll hammer on the B button so many times while bustin' chifforobes that it may require replacement following the end of the game. The minigames inserted to try and add some \"game\" to the process of perpetual item-hunting are merely dull variations on \"how fast can you press the trigger buttons in succession?\" and \"can you time this A button press correctly?\" This never becomes more complicated, nor more interesting. You repeat the same meager set of actions ceaselessly until the game simply stops throwing more levels at you.</p><p style=\"\">And that's after just a couple of hours. There are some multiplayer co-op levels, but you can't play them online. With so little content to speak of, and only early fits of charm to mask the overwhelmingly monotonous mechanics, Dead Block feels like a weird product of a bygone era. It's as if it was plucked from the earliest days of downloadable gaming, back when digital games often relied more on single-minded gimmicks than the fully fleshed-out concepts of late, and $10 seemed like such a great deal for any game you could play with buttons on a console. That era has long since passed us by, and we're better for it. Pass on Dead Block, and you'll be better for it, too.</p>", "deck": "Dead Block is dead boring.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-396/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35798/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dead-block/3030-35798/", "id": 35798, "name": "Dead Block"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2011-07-08 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-111998/", "id": 111998, "name": "Dead Block"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/earth-defense-force-insect-armageddon-review/1900-397/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Say what you will about <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7338\" href=\"/earth-defense-force-2017/3030-7338/\" slug=\"earth-defense-force-2017\">Earth Defense Force 2017</a>, but at least it was distinct.

Vicious Cycle has certainly made improvements over the previous game, but the fundamental flaw with Insect Armageddon is that it simply doesn't capture the sheer scale and explosive chaos that made its Japanese predecessor so memorable. Couple that with a shooter backbone that's too simple and too repetitive to rope in fans of the genre and you're left with Insect Armageddon, a game that will fail to entice either fans of the genre or the series.</p><p style=\"\">It’s all too bad, because Insect Armageddon is, in a number of meaningful ways, a “better” game than its predecessor. Vicious Cycle has removed many of 2017’s most glaring problems and issues. The previous game’s awkward movement controls have been gutted and replaced with a standard third-person shooter scheme that actually works. Also gone are 2017’s atrocious vehicle controls, replaced again by sensible control mechanisms. No matter how much love--ironic or otherwise--one could have for EDF, that game’s control shortcomings were indefensible, and it’s good to see them replaced with a standard control scheme that lets you stop thinking about what you're doing and simply do it.</p><p style=\"\">Insect Armageddon also significantly expands on the previous game’s multiplayer offerings to bring it in line with modern releases. The series' two-player split screen option returns, but Insect Armageddon also offers online co-op for the campaign for up to three players, as well as a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\" href=\"/horde/3015-3021/\" slug=\"horde\">wave-based survival</a> mode for up to six players online. Online matches run smoothly, and, as you might expect, blasting bugs is always more fun with friends than by your lonesome. The online additions aren’t too extensive, but they’re a welcome addition.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">With a host of improvements made to virtually every facet of the game, Insect Armageddon may seem like a more-than-worthy successor to 2017. However, for all of Insect Armageddon’s upgrades and fixes, I couldn’t help but feel something indelible to EDF had been lost in the translation.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1114/1524800-image_o_matic.x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524800\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1114/1524800-image_o_matic.x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524800\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1114/1524800-image_o_matic.x.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You might think that flying over giant insects would be fun. You would be wrong.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Part of the problem is that, for a game ostensibly about fighting hordes of giant insects, Insect Armageddon feels very small. Though Vicious Cycle can (and does) fill the game world with whole colonies of ants, spiders and mantises, the game rarely evokes the outlandish sense of scale that helped 2017 to stand out in a sea of superior shooters. 2017 featured motherships that filled every corner of the sky, and robots so tall that the ground shook with every lumbering step across the level. The city would shatter apart with errant rocket blasts, laser strikes, and acid web discharge flying in all directions. For all of its obvious faults, 2017 did an incredible job rendering its own giant, explosive chaos.</p><p style=\"\">But Insect Armageddon never manages to hit that mark. The giant ants and robots of 2017 aren’t nearly as big in Insect Armageddon, and too many of the game’s battles take place inside smaller areas, fenced off by invincible buildings that further shrink and contain the scale of the conflict. The series' ridiculous rocket explosions and ship crashes are muted and wimpy, and the act of firing those weapons isn't particularly satisfying. To make matters worse, the ants and giant robots simply disintegrate into the air upon death, which really takes the impact out of destroying a swarm of enemies. Only in the very last level of EDF’s brief four-hour campaign does the game introduce an element that actually matches the ridiculous scope of 2017, but at that point it's too little, too late. The game just can’t tap into that same well of ridiculous, explosive chaos that 2017 was able to maintain, and increasing the difficulty only serves to make individual enemies harder (rather than increasing the number of enemies onscreen at any given moment).</p><p style=\"\">Without being able to emulate the specific qualities that made 2017 compelling, Insect Armageddon’s other flaws are much harder to ignore. Though it improves some of 2017's systems, Insect Armageddon still isn’t a very good shooter compared to the competition; its an achingly simple shooter with a run-and-gun mentality more commonly associated with the early 2000s than shooters today. Killing bugs and robots gets old pretty fast, and it’s all made worse by the game's total lack of mission variety. Through the game’s 15 missions, you’ll alternate between holding down a position from attackers, destroying ant hills to keep enemies from spawning, and blowing up downed ships. These objective types are recycled endlessly throughout the game, and you’ll have had your fill of these types before you’re a third of the way through the campaign.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9967/1835608-screen_shot_2011_07_08_at_6.57.16_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1835608\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9967/1835608-screen_shot_2011_07_08_at_6.57.16_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1835608\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9967/1835608-screen_shot_2011_07_08_at_6.57.16_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9967/1835608-screen_shot_2011_07_08_at_6.57.16_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Insect Armageddon manages to squash the thrill of killing giant insects.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The few boss and sub-bosses throughout the game could have offered a brief reprieve from the repetitive objective-based missions, but that boredom will only be replaced by frustration. Though every boss has a very clear and obvious weak-point target, it can be extremely difficult to tell if you’re actually hitting the weak spot. This can lead to boss battles that stretch out far longer than they should.</p><p style=\"\">To make the matters of the repetitive gameplay worse, Insect Armageddon has multiple systems in place that are centered around replaying levels and encounters over and over again. Unlike certain other modern shooters, Insect Armageddon can’t make its leveling-based upgrade system compelling and, as such, the constant grinding demanded by the game never inspires the kind of level-crazed loot-focused addiction that it seems to be chasing so desperately.</p><p style=\"\">Insect Armageddon feels trapped between the competing goals of trying to emulate its cult classic forebear and trying to be a modern video game. It splits the difference, and the result is a game that probably won’t please fans of modern shooters <i>or</i> fans of 2017. Insect Armageddon isn’t wanting for content, especially with its $40 launch price tag, but it gives you little reason to explore it.</p>", "deck": "Insect Armageddon fails to capture the chaos that made its predecessor \"special,\" meaning there's little to distract you from the simple, repetitive, and boring gameplay underneath.

Given all the improvements and additions and craziness, though, it's a little disappointing that I didn't enjoy <i>playing</i> this sequel as much as the first one.</p><p style=\"\">This is certainly a livelier and more vibrant game than before. Those new doohickeys include grind rails, flying cars, exploding barrels with saddles on them, and a purple bomb that shoots you between the fore- and background. Twisted Pixel's standard-setting Beard Engine has also evolved to make basic cinematic effects like depth of field more prominent, and the artists have run a little wilder than the first game's sterile lab environments with some tropical and futuristic urban settings as well. There's even a world map for each of the three areas, and finding secret exits in some levels will open up optional hidden levels elsewhere. The up-to-four-player multiplayer mode also returns from the first game, again with its own set of levels. On the surface it all sort of feels like the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1334\" href=\"/super-mario-world/3030-1334/\" slug=\"super-mario-world\">Super Mario World</a> to the first game's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\" href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" slug=\"super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros.</a></p><p style=\"\">New window dressing notwithstanding, it's important (and probably not surprising) to know the basic action and controls here haven't changed one iota, so if you didn't care for the insanely rigorous triple-jump puzzle-platforming in Splosion Man, nothing here is going to reel you in either. On the contrary, that stagnation and some awkward-feeling level layouts might actually put off players, like me, who gladly gritted their teeth through the original. There was an elegance to the design of that first game, where you had to hit switches, wall-jump, and bounce off of explosion points with speed and surety to make it to the end of each level. Sure, there was some repetition and more dying involved in feeling your way through each stage, but it felt like as long as you were precisely hitting your cues, you would generally splode your way to safety.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1707374-5438321903_1d7ac38a44_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1707374\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/176/1707374-5438321903_1d7ac38a44_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1707374\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/176/1707374-5438321903_1d7ac38a44_b.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This is way better-looking game, but some of the visual fluff gets in the way of the action.

Maybe my patience for this kind of thing was ruined by <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25114\" href=\"/super-meat-boy/3030-25114/\" slug=\"super-meat-boy\">Super Meat Boy</a>, the current hard-game gold standard on consoles, and a game where the controls are so pinpoint-precise that you could frequently air-control your way out of a bad situation and narrowly avoid dying. Consequently, every death in that game felt like it was your fault. By contrast, Ms. Splosion Man takes forever to get running at full speed, and you don't have much air control. Since the game is constantly throwing obstacles at you that require some guesswork to get through if you haven't seen them before, you get into a lot of situations where you're just forced to eat it after making a bad call. Is that barrel emitter the kind that holds barrels in place or the kind that drops them straight down? Oh, it was the other kind? Back to the checkpoint before the last three major obstacles I already cleared. At least I learned my way through another small piece of the level. It just gets tedious.</p><p style=\"\">The game also gets a little sloppy with things like camera work and window dressing. There are a few too many instances where some wonky camera angle obscures the next hotspot you need to splode off of, and it's downright baffling that multiple levels throw foreground objects (which include flying sharks, to be fair) right in front of where your character is supposed to be. I'm all for a little rote level memorization when it makes sense, but here it feels like that's the only reliable method of inching your way through most of the levels, when tighter controls and cleaner presentation would give more room for feeling that rush when you narrowly scrape through a sequence your first time. Some of the levels are absolutely better than others and <i>do</i> allow for that, but the less elegant ones drag the whole experience down. Other stupid-hard games like Meat Boy, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30380\" href=\"/limbo/3030-30380/\" slug=\"limbo\">Limbo</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26923\" href=\"/trials-hd/3030-26923/\" slug=\"trials-hd\">Trials</a> have made the trial-and-error thing fun with faster respawns and better checkpointing, so as much as I enjoyed the first Splosion Man, it was disappointing to feel like the sequel doesn't live up to the current standards for this kind of game, especially since the spirit of this franchise (and all of Twisted Pixel's games) is so lovable.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112517/1820264-ms_splosion_man_screenshotsf.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1820264\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56270627062706\" data-width=\"606\" style=\"width: 606px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112517/1820264-ms_splosion_man_screenshotsf.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1820264\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112517/1820264-ms_splosion_man_screenshotsf.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/112517/1820264-ms_splosion_man_screenshotsf.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Please make the hurting stop.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That absurdist spirit is alive in Ms. Splosion Man. It's a little ironic that the surreal ending of the first game--born as it was out of the necessity of limited time and resources--was seemingly the flashpoint that led Twisted Pixel into its bizarre embrace of both full-motion video and balls-out insanity, but here we are. This game lets you spend an in-game currency on some wonderfully cheesy music videos, green-screen outtakes, and other production trinkets, and I also think it's neat that you can just straight-up buy the Xbox-specific gamer pics and avatar awards with the same currency in that store. Things are even more ludicrous in-game, where your character constantly spouts girly '90s pop lyrics from the likes of En Vogue and Ace of Base, and there's yet another <i>Total Recall</i>-related non sequitur to be had. The all-video ending, of course, is as stupidly great as you would hope, and the unexpected format of the last boss fight nearly rescues the entire game from its faults. Though, it's probably telling that it was such a relief to find out that fight doesn't play anything like the rest of the game.</p><p style=\"\">Ms. Splosion Man requires a saintly degree of patience to properly enjoy, but if you can muster it in your heart to forgive the rough spots, there's plenty more tough-as-nails platforming to be had here (an enormous amount for the $10 asking price, really). I love what Twisted Pixel does--in some ways, there's no other developer doing it exactly the same way right now--but as much as I also love beards, games like this make me wish they'd focus a little more on producing things that are more fun to actually play.</p>", "deck": "Ms. Splosion Man lands on shaky footing, but at least she gets a lot of mileage out of that bow.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-398/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33330/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ms-splosion-man/3030-33330/", "id": 33330, "name": "Ms. Splosion Man"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-07-13 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-105659/", "id": 105659, "name": "Ms. Splosion Man"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/captain-america-super-soldier-review/1900-399/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Make no mistake: <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32845\" href=\"/captain-america-super-soldier/3030-32845/\" slug=\"captain-america-super-soldier\">Captain America: Super Soldier</a> owes much of its existence to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-asylum\">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>.

Regrettably, the rest of Super Soldier isn't strong enough to stand out from other comic book-licensed games. A weak story, boring platforming, and dully recurrent gameplay ensure that Captain America doesn’t step outside of Batman’s long shadow. Super Soldier is a decent enough action-adventure game, but it’s completely inessential.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/1817438-ultimates.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1817438\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/1817438-ultimates.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1817438\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34651/1817438-ultimates.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Fake Nazis are no match for punching.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At least you won’t be spoiling much of the upcoming movie by playing this game. Super Soldier follows Steve Rogers, now <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1376\" href=\"/captain-america/3005-1376/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a>, as he investigates a mysterious German castle that serves as the location for Hydra, the Nazi-stand-ins that desire to raise an army of their <i>own</i> super soldiers to spread fake-Nazi chaos across the world. As perennial straight arrow Captain America, you're tasked with sabotaging the facility and crippling the efforts of Hydra head scientist Arnin Zola.</p><p style=\"\">As you would imagine, the main mechanic that differentiates Captain America from his foes is his shield, and the weapon is integrated well into combat. The shield gives Captain America a throwing weapon that is extremely useful for enemy takedowns. A quick double-tap of the right trigger will cause the shield to ricochet around enemy groups, which allows for more effective control in larger encounters. The shield’s most useful function is its defensive utility; with a well-timed button press, Captain America can block ranged attacks from any direction, or even send the shots flying back at opponents. Sending sniper bullets back at Hydra grunts never fails to satisfy. Beyond those additions (and a couple of super moves), Super Soldier borrows much of its combat from the Arkham Asylum blueprint, which means that it’s still pretty fun to wade into crowds and decimate the lot with well-timed counters, skillful dodging, and swift attacks.</p><p style=\"\">However, that comparison to Arkham Asylum only benefits Captain America in the context of combat. Part of what makes Batman: Arkham Asylum so interesting and fun is getting access to all of those wonderful toys. Batman’s assortment of grappling hooks, batarangs, explosives and flight capes provided the impetus to design a game with a multitude of paths to explore, as well as numerous ways to dispatch enemies. By contrast, Captain America... well, the dude pretty much just has a shield (and some explosives), and the game is designed as such. You’ll spend the whole of Super Soldier moving through the game’s highly linear story and gameplay, with virtually no changes to the game’s combat model from opening to closing credits. Only in the last hour does the game open up and let you explore the whole of the Hydra compound, but at that point you’ll be in striking distance of finishing the game entirely, and you’re probably better served by just seeing the game to its conclusion than spending time exploring the sewer networks that connect locations together.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/1837374-struckerfight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1837374\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34651/1837374-struckerfight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1837374\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34651/1837374-struckerfight.jpg\"></a><figcaption>In the battle between claw and shield, the winner is the one with the Quick Time Event.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">When you're not fighting, you're probably grabbing onto ledges and flipping around. Using something that sort of resembles the flashy-but-consequence-free platforming of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-957\" href=\"/uncharted/3025-957/\" slug=\"uncharted\">Uncharted</a> as a starting point, Super Soldier introduces platforming sequences that are literally one-button Quick Time Events. Failing to push the button at the proper interval merely results in Captain America halting his movement and staying on the environmental object he previously latched onto. There is zero penalty for missing these sequences, and the timing throughout the event is so specific that it’s easy to lose your momentum. These platforming events suffer even more when the Captain is expected to change direction, as it’s hard to know which direction on the analog stick to push to actually turn the other way. These acrobatic events make sense within the context of Captain America the character, but the events themselves are so stiff and boring that they detract from the game rather than add variety.</p><p style=\"\">The only other element to provide a break from the competent combat in Captain America is a swarm of collectables that crosses the line from excessive into overwhelming. Throughout his journey around the Hydra compound, Captain America will stumble across enemy intel, <i>stacks</i> of intel, briefcases (probably full of intel), film strips, schematics, falconry gear, table statues, ornamental eggs (intel?), music boxes, and rooster statues to be collected and returned to the Allied brass. Beyond the ridiculous quality of picturing Captain America sticking a dictionary’s worth of intel down his pants, the problem with all of these collectables is that they overshadow the main gameplay; at times, I felt I was spending more time deviating from the main path down really obvious side paths to collect this junk than I was fighting fake Nazis. It’s repetitive busywork, but it's different repetitive <i>busywork,</i> representing the only real distraction from the rote, plodding main path you're otherwise wandering down.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">While the combat might offer you a few hours of relatively amusing fake-Nazi bashing, there's little here that hasn't been done better by other developers with other superheroes. Captain America is absolutely a piece of summer fluff; a competent but slight release that you’re bound to forget about the second it leaves your console.</p>", "deck": "Captain America may be derivative as all get out, but that doesn't mean there aren't some pleasures to be found in throwing a shield at a fake Nazi.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-399/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32845/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/captain-america-super-soldier/3030-32845/", "id": 32845, "name": "Captain America: Super Soldier"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-07-19 09:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-109103/", "id": 109103, "name": "Captain America: Super Soldier"}, "reviewer": "Matt"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/puzzle-agent-2-review/1900-400/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86712/1829779-2011_07_01_00015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1829779\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86712/1829779-2011_07_01_00015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1829779\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86712/1829779-2011_07_01_00015.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Nelson Tethers.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As much of a feel-good story as it has been to see <a data-ref-id=\"3010-397\" href=\"/telltale-games/3010-397/\" slug=\"telltale-games\">Telltale</a> find independent success both reviving the moribund format of the classic adventure game and spearheading honest-to-goodness <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1293\" href=\"/episodic-content/3015-1293/\" slug=\"episodic-content\">episodic gaming</a>, it's fair to say that the mechanical similarities from one Telltale series to the next has led to a certain amount of adventure fatigue.

Not a particularly big deal, since it was relatively short and immensely enjoyable. Plus, Puzzle Agent 2 expands on the folksy mythology in a number of ways that make the original taste like weak tea, with the weirdness expanding well beyond the confines of Scoggins. Some questions are answered, but those answers lead to even more puzzling questions, and entirely new, equally surreal mysteries are introduced as well. I'm reluctant to go into any particulars here, simply because it's so enjoyable to see it all unfold with fresh eyes.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86712/1829777-2011_07_01_00005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1829777\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86712/1829777-2011_07_01_00005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1829777\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86712/1829777-2011_07_01_00005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Creepy Spaceman.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As much as I enjoyed the continued adventures of Agent Tethers, it's a damn shame that the experience is undermined by weak, repetitive puzzle designs. Beyond chatting with other characters and watching the story unfold, the puzzles represent the bulk of the experience here. Of the 30-odd discrete puzzles contained within, it felt like the majority of the puzzles fell into one of four or five very specific formats.</p><p style=\"\">The bigger issue is that I rarely found the puzzles particularly challenging. The game grades you based on how many attempts you take to successfully solve a puzzle, as well as how many optional hints you indulge in. More often than not, I was solving puzzles on my first try, no hints, A+. The rare exceptions tended to require specific knowledge outside of the game, which, frankly, felt like a cheat. On more than one occasion, I found myself second-guessing a solution because it seemed far too obvious, only to find that my solution was correct. Don't take this as bragging, it's just that the original Puzzle Agent was consistently more successful at stumping me, and that challenge is what makes solving puzzles fundamentally enjoyable. I also felt like the puzzles weren't integrated into the story as elegantly as they were in the original, which took greater care in contextualizing the puzzles.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">My experience with Puzzle Agent 2 wasn't a complete wash, and with the way it leaves the story, I hope it doesn't represent the end for the weird world of Nelson Tethers.

The game is also engrossing enough in its own right that it makes you wonder why we don't see more games in this style these days, now that computing power has advanced so far that even a modestly priced downloadable title like this one can offer such immense, tactile control over the very elements of nature, and render them in such a gorgeously evocative fashion.</p><p style=\"\">Like Molyneux's old god games, From Dust casts you as a formless deity with a sky-high perspective on a burgeoning tribal people struggling to gain their footing in a rugged, unforgiving land. But the tools of your godly trade are far more primal and impressive than the ones in those comparatively primitive games. The main game mode consists of over a dozen separate maps, all prebuilt and discrete from one another, in which you have to lead your people to a number of ancient totems where they can build villages and begin to tame the wilderness. Your primary method of clearing the way for your helpless little minions is direct manipulation of earth, water, and lava, namely by sucking those substances up into a floating ball and depositing them elsewhere.</p><p style=\"\">From Dust actively encourages free-form problem-solving because these basic building blocks interact with each other and the land more or less exactly how you'd expect them to. Pour water on top of flowing lava, or dump a stream of lava into a standing body of water, and you've made some new rock. Build a wall of sand around the flow of a river to redirect it away from a village site and toward the ocean--but be careful the water current isn't strong enough to overrun your wall and wash it away. You leave each map looking dramatically different than it did when you started, having made a profound effect on the very lay of the land and the water and vegetation spanning it. Exercising creativity to shape the land in your own way is both the greatest and simplest joy From Dust offers.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1838756-from_dust_s_040_lava_and_water.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1838756\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1838756-from_dust_s_040_lava_and_water.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1838756\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1838756-from_dust_s_040_lava_and_water.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of the maps aren't as friendly as others.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Your divine arsenal is so robust that the game has to go out of its way to create situations that can actually challenge you. Individual villages can be wiped off the map by flooding or fire, though you'll never have to completely start a scenario over unless you not only lose all your villages but even all the tiny people who are capable of rebuilding them at your command. The game wastes no time contriving supernatural threats to your settlers, with tsunamis and volcanic eruptions that trigger every couple of minutes in some levels, and other scenarios where the very land itself undulates beneath your village. Still other maps start out with some head-scratching initial conditions, like village totems that are completely submerged underwater, that almost make From Dust feel like an out-and-out puzzle game.</p><p style=\"\">These frequent catastrophes occasionally require stricter timing from you than the game really allows, since it takes a good couple of minutes for settlers and sages to move from one village to the next, and calamity can strike at a moment's notice. That leads to you screaming at the tiny little travelers on the television to hurry the hell up and get where they're going before the lava overtakes them, and sometimes you just can't have the foresight to start them on their journeys at the ideal time until you've already played through most of a scenario once. You'll rarely encounter a disaster so all-encompassing that it destroys everything all at once, though.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">As the threats increase, so do your powers. You can plant fire trees to evaporate excess bodies of water, and water trees that spew water in big bursts to squelch nearby flames. But these trees can burn down or flood out your villages, respectively, so care is required in their placement. Bomb trees act as the blunt hammer which, with the application of a little lava or fire, can bust solid rock wide open to make new paths. Then there are the truly magical powers you get on some maps that let you briefly turn all the water around you into a jelly-like solid, or belch infinite earth out of nowhere onto the land.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1838752-from_dust_s_037_extinguish_fire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1838752\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1838752-from_dust_s_037_extinguish_fire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1838752\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1838752-from_dust_s_037_extinguish_fire.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1838752-from_dust_s_037_extinguish_fire.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game renders its naturalistic environments with startling beauty.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">My only major complaint against From Dust, and it's a big one, is that you just can't lay down your dirt and lava very precisely with the Xbox's analog sticks. You can control how fast you deposit them with the triggers, but the limited camera angles and clumsy stick-based cursor movement introduce a bit more randomness into your terrain-building than I would have liked. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to build a bridge up to the edge of your town with lava, inadvertently setting the foliage on fire because you got a few pixels too close, then having to scramble to grab some water to douse the flames (and flooding your town into oblivion if you're not careful). The PC version, due out next month, may alleviate these issues with its mouse control, but there's no way to be sure just yet. There are also a few baffling quibbles with the interface that make the game hard for no good reason, like the way bomb trees become almost microscopic after they explode. They grow back to normal size once you replant them, but they can be almost impossible to find if they happen to get swept into the water before you can root them again, forcing you to go on a pixel hunt and watching to see where the cursor changes when you hover over them. There's nothing enjoyable about that.</p><p style=\"\">The game's challenge mode occasionally brings the poor precision of the controls into especially blatant relief. There, you've got 30 brief, unique levels that limit your abilities--for instance, you can only absorb water--and task you with completing very specific objectives. There are some great puzzle-like solutions here that make you utilize the game's mechanics in ways you'll never even think about while playing the main campaign. But as the challenges are all timed, you may find yourself fumbling with the controls more than you'd like, trying to lay down very specific terrain with no margin for error. These issues don't pop up constantly, but know that they exist. Otherwise, the challenge mode is a great way to both lengthen the overall game and extend out the mechanics in some interesting ways.</p><p style=\"\">From Dust is a fantastic value, all told, with a bare minimum of eight hours or more that never feels like you're doing exactly the same thing twice. It's been a long time since god games like this were in fashion (if they ever really were), so in a sense we should be happy we've got a new one to play at all.

That's probably one of the best things going for Atlus' boys-to-men tale about a love triangle with a supernatural twist. It seems that unfaithful men are dying in their sleep, and you'll quickly find yourself caught among their ranks as you figure out what to do with the two girls in your life by day and climbing a seemingly endless supply of block towers in your sleep. You'll need to be adept at both if you want things to end your way, but Catherine's limited character interaction, shallow characters, and monotonous puzzles combine to form a unique experience that feels frustratingly limited in every respect.</p><p style=\"\">In the game you'll play as Vincent, a weak, wishy-washy sort of guy who's always getting admonished or outright bossed around by his longtime girlfriend, Katherine. Just as he's lamenting that he's not sure he's ready to commit further in this relationship, a younger woman named Catherine stumbles into his life, and before long, he's cheating on his girlfriend with Catherine, who, by comparison, seems completely carefree and indifferent about, well, everything. Being faced with a choice between carefree youth and the increasing responsibilities of adulthood only intensifies as the story proceeds. Before long, things get decidedly supernatural as rumors start of nightmares that are killing traitorous men in their sleep and, sure enough, cheating Vincent finds himself in a nightly fight for survival against endless block-filled towers and his own worst fears.</p><p style=\"\">The interactive parts of Catherine are broken into two separate chunks. When awake, you'll watch a lot of cutscenes and hear a lot of dialogue, but you'll eventually find yourself turned loose in a bar, where your friends gather at the end of every night. In the bar you can walk around and talk to the various patrons, many of whom are also enduring the same nightly ordeals that you are, but no one can really remember their dreams all that clearly. Most of the dialogue has you sitting and listening to their stories, but you'll occasionally get to make a dialogue choice that might just give them the encouragement they need to survive the night's trials. You'll also receive text messages from the two ladies in your life, and how you respond to them--or, in fact, <i>if</i> you respond to them--helps determine how the story unfolds by swinging an alignment meter one way or the other. Generally speaking, it'll shift to the blue side if you're choosing the responsible options that Katherine might agree with or red if your decisions are more in line with something that free-wheeling Catherine might do. The interactions feel incredibly limited, and there isn't that much to do in the bar before heading home and starting the next action stage unless you're interested in playing a retro-styled arcade version of the block puzzles that make up the rest to the game or working over the jukebox, which slowly gives you access to Catherine's soundtrack, as well as select cuts from Persona 4 and other Atlus releases.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30280/1775774-catherine_screens_26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1775774\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30280/1775774-catherine_screens_26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1775774\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30280/1775774-catherine_screens_26.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Catherine's just kind of annoying.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At night, the action begins, as Vincent finds himself surrounded by sheep at the foot of a large tower of blocks. You can push or pull the blocks around, and the goal is to quickly climb the tower. The game starts out slowly to show you the basic logic behind the blocks' properties. For example, blocks will attach at diagonal edges, so you don't always need to have a block directly underneath another block for support. Once you've got the basics, later levels start introducing special blocks, like ones that crumble when you step on them, or trampoline-style blocks that let you jump up and grab onto ledges you wouldn't be able to reach otherwise, or ice blocks that cause you (and the blocks you're pushing) to slip and keep moving. Once you get the logic behind how the blocks move and start to see solutions in the puzzles instead of just a mountain of blocks, it isn't impossibly difficult. Unfortunately, that moment didn't happen for me until I was most of the way through the game. But the difficulty of the individual puzzles isn't what brings Catherine down. It's their repetitive nature. It feels like there are <i>tons</i> of levels in the game, and they're all roughly the same. The special blocks change things up a bit, and you'll have to climb towers while running away from a large boss-style monster during the last puzzle of every night, but the act of pulling and pushing blocks around to form staircases and create paths doesn't hold up for the entire game, and by night three or four (which is a little before the game's halfway point), I found myself not wanting to play anymore.</p><p style=\"\">The big issues with Catherine are that the gameplay of block puzzles gets old fast and the way the characters develop in the story isn't engaging enough to pick up the slack. Despite being able to make choices that sway the alignment meter and alter the outcome of the story, Vincent's behavior usually doesn't line up with the choices you've made. Even if you're very clearly steering him in one direction, the story beats essentially force him to remain mostly indecisive right up until the final set of challenges. In my case, this resulted in a Vincent who was constantly saying that he was looking to remain true to Katherine, yet kept having nervous breakdowns about Catherine and her feelings. Considering how pushy and psycho Catherine acts, it's hard to imagine anyone feeling the need to \"let her down gently.\" With the characters written that way, it's hard to care about the story very much, especially when you consider that most of your choices are made in-between action stages, where a confessional booth acts as some sort of personality test, asking this-or-that questions about how you'd act in specific situations and so on. It feels like the decisions you're making are almost completely detached from the story itself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31223/1675513-cvicmr43vtn3wxxp6tkml2mj37i66zbo_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1675513\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5375\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31223/1675513-cvicmr43vtn3wxxp6tkml2mj37i66zbo_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1675513\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31223/1675513-cvicmr43vtn3wxxp6tkml2mj37i66zbo_noscale.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31223/1675513-cvicmr43vtn3wxxp6tkml2mj37i66zbo_noscale.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Big bosses will try to trip you up as you climb the tower.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That said, the story sequences themselves are pretty well-made. There are a handful of fully animated sequences, but even the in-engine stuff is sharp, colorful, and full of personality. Some of the characters you'll meet around the bar have interesting side stories that are told both in and out of the dream world, and the voice cast is solid enough to make those stories work. It's a shame that most of the game's strongest points are practically crammed into the margins to make room for more block pushing.</p><p style=\"\">It's certainly not awful, but too many aspects of Catherine felt like they were actively trying to push me away. More variety in the gameplay would have helped, as would more meaningful interactions with the game's cast. As it stands, the coolest thing about Catherine is that there really isn't anything else out there like it.

Here, those abilities include a buzzsaw, tractor beam, reflective laser, and an all-purpose jointed grasping arm that lets you pick up and move objects around, or grab onto certain surfaces and anchor your ship when you're caught in a strong current.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852604-ice_boss.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852604\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852604-ice_boss.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852604\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852604-ice_boss.png\"></a><figcaption>There are some pretty neat boss designs in here.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All of these items operate with sensible dual-joystick controls that especially give the up-close abilities like the saw and grabbing arm a tactile, one-to-one feel. Some of the ranged weapons are a little less reliable, though; it's tough with a couple of them to see where you're going to shoot until you already shoot. Some sort of onscreen aiming cue or reticle would have helped, since the little animated weapons attached to your ship aren't always sufficient on their own, especially when the camera pulls way out in some areas. There are a few other weird inconsistencies in the way the grab arm works and such that make the gameplay occasionally feel a little rough, but there are very few instances where that directly impacts your ability to get through a given area. At least the movement control feels spot-on. You've got great maneuverability, and your ship has the perfect amount of weight to it.</p><p style=\"\">Actually, your very first ability in the game is an omnidirectional scanning beam that shows you exactly which ability to use on each enemy and environmental obstacle you encounter. Of course you're free not to use the scanner if you want to rely on the ol' trial and error, but its presence belies a broader theme in this game's design: it's almost painfully straightforward. From the outset, the map shows you most of the \"points of interest\" where upgrades, collectibles, and ability-specific obstacles are located, and it automatically annotates each of these points with the ability you need to use on it once you've scanned it, so it's especially easy to head back to all the icons for a given ability once you've picked it up.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852603-core.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852603\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852603-core.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852603\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852603-core.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852603-core.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some of the areas have a great sense of scale.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's never any guesswork involved in where you need to go, and very little in where you <i>can</i> go, since all of the nooks and crannies on the shadow planet are quite obvious either on the map or in the course of your exploration. I only found one of what I would truly consider a hidden area in the whole game, yet I finished the campaign lacking only two collectibles out of dozens, and I didn't even go out of my way looking for those. Don't get me wrong, this game is plenty entertaining and offers a lot of unique things to do and look at, but you may feel like you breezed through it and saw most of its sights more leisurely than you'd expect from a game of this type.</p><p style=\"\">It sure is a great-looking game, full of greasy-looking tentacles and weird insectoid enemies that all animate like they're straight out of an animated feature film. That goes for the different environments as well, which have you zooming around underwater, through ice caverns full of laser-reflecting crystals, and in a mechanized area where flying inside rotating gears gives the illusion that the entire world itself is rotating around your stationary ship. There's a unique character to the game's visual presentation that alone nearly makes this game worth the price of admission. It's a joy just to look at. Look at it yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">When you finish the relatively brief campaign, you've still got the \"lantern run\" multiplayer mode, and that might be one of the best things in this package. It's a strictly scrolling-to-the-right affair where you and up to three others use your ship's grabby arm to each drag your own lantern through an increasingly tough obstacle course, all while a screen-spanning tentacle monster relentlessly pursues you. Since the arm counts as a weapon, you have to drop the lantern in cases where you need to fight enemies to advance, or use the arm or buzzsaw to clear other obstacles, so you get into a lot of fast-paced fight-or-flight strategizing from moment to moment here.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852608-sound_boss.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852608\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852608-sound_boss.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852608\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852608-sound_boss.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852608-sound_boss.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>I like how all these screenshots are a different color.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The best part about lantern run is that the order of the enemies and challenges seems to be somewhat randomized each time you play it. The worst part is that the difficulty doesn't seem to differ much (or at all) whether you're playing alone or with other people, making it pretty overwhelming when you're going solo. But lantern run is a blast with a full group of players taking turns carrying lanterns, fighting enemies, and clearing out obstacles so everyone can get through. Lantern run makes high-level demands on your skills that the single-player campaign never does.</p><p style=\"\">Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet may not offer the depth or distraction of the standouts in this specific subgenre, but it still effectively scratches the same itch as those games, and it does it with style.
