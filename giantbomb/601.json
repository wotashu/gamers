Luckily, the game gets close to finding a happy medium between <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dead-rising/3025-1218/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1218\">Dead Rising</a>'s signature weirdness and a slightly more traditional open-world format that makes this by far the most approachable game yet in the series.</p><p style=\"\">The first two games confined you and your zombie outbreak to a shopping mall and a casino complex, respectively, while Dead Rising 3 moves the action within the entirety of the fictional city of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/los-perdidos/3035-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4456\">Los Perdidos</a>. You still get access to the retail mayhem of the previous games via the many toy shops, gun stores, restaurants, clothing outlets, and other shopping spots scattered around town--meaning there are still hundreds of everyday objects available for use as weapons--but the new game does away with the pervasive loading screens of the old ones, allowing you to move around the entire city and a surprising number of building interiors freely as you complete missions, combine weird weapons into weirder weapons, and look for the scads of collectible weapon blueprints and other trinkets that have been added here.</p><p style=\"\">At the same time, Dead Rising 3 softens the overriding time pressure of the previous games to the point that you hardly have to worry about the fact that there's even a timer in the first place. In the past, it was nigh-impossible to do all of the side missions your first time through the game, and each step of the storyline had its own short timer that demanded you get on with the plot sooner than later, or else risk having to start the entire game over. Starting and restarting over and over to build up your character level and streamline your path through the various missions became a hallmark of Dead Rising.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2565723-8679588152-DR3_c.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2565723\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2565723-8679588152-DR3_c.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2565723\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/18/187968/2565723-8679588152-DR3_c.png\"></a><figcaption>Nick and Dick: co-op buddies with an axe to grind.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">By contrast, you could go through Dead Rising 3 and easily complete every side quest (which have very generous timers) and story mission (which have no timers at all) on your first try. Rather than putting a ticking clock on each individual plot point, you now begin the game under the threat of an air strike to occur six days hence, and then go about your business at your own pace. And even if you somehow don't make it to the end of the story in the ample time provided, you can restart at the beginning of any chapter right up to the final one, meaning you don't have to replay the entire game like you did in the past if you've squandered too much of your time.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The decreased time pressure and seeming tweaks to your health and enemy damage make Dead Rising 3 feel like an easier game than its predecessors--though thankfully the Nightmare mode that's unlocked from the beginning increases the restrictions on saving, health, and time limits more in line with the older games, if you're looking for that classic challenge. I originally worried the less demanding normal mode would make Dead Rising 3 feel less like Dead Rising. But ultimately the fact that side missions can still expire while you're screwing around--along with the big red warning that shows up every 12 or so in-game hours to go \"HEY HERE'S HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE LEFT REMEMBER THERE'S A BOMB COMING?\"--kept just enough of that sense of urgency in place for my taste, while allowing me to get into more of the other ridiculous aspects of a Dead Rising game without quite so much restriction.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2574915-combovehicle_fork+work.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2574915\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2574915-combovehicle_fork+work.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2574915\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2574915-combovehicle_fork+work.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2574915-combovehicle_fork+work.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Combo vehicles are one of the best new things in this sequel.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Dead Rising 3 is still deeply stupid. That's primarily because of the combo weapons that return from 2, the absurdity of which has been amplified to the Nth degree. You're still jamming things like a motorcycle engine and a microwave together to produce nonsense like a nuclear death ray, and now you can combo already combined weapons with further add-ons to create even dumber superweapons. As Los Perdidos is a true open world, there are cars you can drive around, and you can combine several of these to create total nonsense vehicles that let you suck up zombies and spit them out wadded up into zombie balls, or place a steamroller on the front of a motorcycle to let you run down hundreds of zombies at a time. And I do mean hundreds; Dead Rising 3 crams more enemies into one frame than maybe any game I can remember, and maintains a (mostly) stable frame rate doing it. Mowing down those hundreds of monsters at once is the purest joy the game offers, and putting all those ridiculous destructive implements together has gotten even friendlier now that you can do it anywhere, rather than having to find a workbench just to build your weapons.</p><p style=\"\">There have been even more enhancements to the way Dead Rising works, in the form of a variable skill tree that lets you customize your play style as you go. In contrast to the previous games, where specific upgrades to health and character speed and so on were tied to each level, you simply earn skill points when you level up that you can drop into any number of categories to make your weapons more durable, give you more health, make your followers heartier, and so on. This is a great way to make the game feel looser and more tailored to the way you want to play it, while keeping the constant feeling of character progression in place.</p><p style=\"\">Again, though, the game is much easier than in the past; even the psychopaths that serve as the game bosses do less damage and die faster than their counterparts in the previous games, and the way you can build your skill tree and amass combo weapons (which you can simply spawn in droves from a safe house once you've built them once) will let you cut through hordes and hordes of zombies without much trouble. It's an easier game than the previous Dead Risings, but it's also a more gleefully entertaining one. If you relished the way those old games were built, you should play on Nightmare immediately. For everyone else, the regular mode will simply be a much better time.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2574924-dr3_diego_boss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2574924\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2574924-dr3_diego_boss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2574924\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2574924-dr3_diego_boss.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2574924-dr3_diego_boss.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some of the scenarios certainly still feel like delightful nonsense.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Dead Rising 3 is a little less silly than its predecessors, but only a little. The story plays it just a bit straighter this time around, with a government conspiracy weaving in and out of this latest zombie outbreak, but the events of this sequel also follow directly from what happened in the last two games. So expect plenty of references to <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/frank-west/3005-715/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-715\">Frank West</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/zombrex/3015-5678/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5678\">Zombrex</a>, Phenotrans, and so on, as well as some pretty absurd character encounters, scenarios, and boss fights. A couple of the psychos fall into slightly questionable stereotypical territory, but most of what's going on here is dumb and random in the amusing way that Dead Rising has always had about it. It feels more like a proper entry in this series than the flat, humorless image the early marketing for the game created earlier this year.</p><p style=\"\">As a launch game, Dead Rising 3 has a lot to offer. You could easily spend a couple dozen hours maxing out your character level, doing every side mission, and scouring for all the collectible weapon blueprints and Frank West statues, and that's before tackling the stiffer challenge and more oppressive time restrictions in Nightmare mode. The game isn't quite as off-the-wall insane as the Dead Risings that came before, but it's close enough that it should satisfy most franchise fans, while also being a lot easier to recommend to people who have previously found the overbearing quirks of this series a little too much to handle.</p>", "deck": "The third outing of Capcom's other, more ridiculous zombie franchise ably walks the line between approachability and the series' trademark off-the-wall quirk.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-616/", "platforms": "Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42902/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dead-rising-3/3030-42902/", "id": 42902, "name": "Dead Rising 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-11-29 10:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-129741/", "id": 129741, "name": "Dead Rising 3"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag-review/1900-617/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Count me among <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed-iii/3030-37494/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37494\">Assassin's Creed III</a>'s passionate detractors. I realize the last entry in the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed/3025-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-38\">Assassin's Creed</a> franchise has its fans, but I personally found <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-82\">Ubisoft</a>'s wrap-up of its core <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/desmond-miles/3005-305/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-305\">Desmond</a>-focused AC trilogy too languid in pace, and peculiarly dull for an entry in a series so thoroughly predicated upon swift and creative methods of murdering people. <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag/3030-41518/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41518\">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a> would, at first glance, seem to be cut from similar cloth to III. Though it takes place several decades prior to the Revolutionary War events of the last release, many of the same systems from that game have found their way into this sequel. However, where Black Flag sets itself apart is where AC III <em>fell</em> apart for me. Taking its setting into the pirate-filled waters of the early 18th century Caribbean, Black Flag crafts a surprisingly and wonderfully vibrant world to explore, both at sea and by land. And while its story isn't all that much more interesting than anything in the last few entries in this series, Assassin's Creed IV has so much to do, and so much of it is genuinely entertaining, that you'll be far too busy to care about its periodic missteps.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495910-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495910\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495910-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495910\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495910-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Surprising as it may sound, Black Flag's high seas adventure is one of the most enjoyable entries in the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It helps that Assassin's Creed IV doesn't waste much time getting you into the thick of things--or, well, comparatively speaking, anyway. As this series is often wont to do, Black Flag takes a few hours to guide you through its many systems, side-ventures, and mechanics (sometimes tutoring you on things you've already done several times.) Much of this stuff you'll probably already recognize if you're a series regular, though the ways in which Black Flag molds its existing gameplay into a heretofore unfamiliar open world design is where it's at its best.</p><p style=\"\">The biggest change by far is the new open-world sailing. The boating from AC III is back in roughly the form you may remember, but now sailing the open waters has been expanded to act as your primary method of getting from place to place. The major cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston are joined by a large smattering of smaller isles, ports, and deserted specks of land. Even in the open waters, numerous activities will present themselves, including simple ship-to-ship combat and plunder, underwater diving missions, and enemy fort capturing.</p><p style=\"\">None of this stuff would work if the ship controls weren't up to snuff. Thankfully, sailing the open seas is largely a joy. Though the boat controls certainly take a bit of getting used to--especially early on, before you've been able to upgrade your ship sufficiently to survive anything but the most basic combat scenarios--but once you manage to grasp them, the sea becomes an inviting, and even thrilling place. Ship combat can, at times, certainly be a chore, especially in zones where enemies lay claim to the territory, in which case you will often have to avoid going anywhere near them to avoid a protracted combat scenario. The game also does maybe the dumbest thing imaginable in having you engage in ship-based stealth in a couple of story missions. This is not a small, easily maneuverable boat, mind you, and trying to move it stealthily between enemies while avoiding even the slightest collision or infraction is a deeply irritating process. Fortunately, these situations only arise a couple of times, and represent just a fraction of the far more interesting endeavors you'll embark upon while on the water.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2447693-859634_420947987997997_2029487383_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2447693\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/2447693-859634_420947987997997_2029487383_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2447693\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33529/2447693-859634_420947987997997_2029487383_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Many of the Caribbean's most famous pirates make appearances in Black Flag, often as friends, betrayers, or both.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The rest of the time you'll be on land, engaging in the usual types of story-based assassination missions, while often veering off the main path to do assassination contracts, fight off random enemy encounters, chase down couriers, purchase various businesses, climb to synchronization points, hunt animals, and collect any number of different things, ranging from the usual Animus fragments to sea chanties, which your crew will immediately add to their repertoire once you climb back aboard your ship.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That last bit represents a welcome shift toward usefulness in Black Flag's side missions. Whereas AC III's side stuff often felt kind of pointless, many of Black Flag's other missions actually have a bit of impact on your main game. Apart from just those chanties, now rescuing pirates from attacks by soldiers awards you new men for your ship's crew. Synchronization points now allow you to fast travel to those locations when necessary. Hunting gives you the necessary skins required to craft upgraded pistol holsters, ammunition bags, and the like. The completionist player will opt to do as much of this stuff as they can anyway, but those less geared toward hitting 100% completion now at least have more intrinsic use for these activities.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, you could skip a lot of these missions, just stick to the story stuff, and still wring quite a few good hours out of Black Flag. The historical character you play, a swashbuckling privateer named <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/edward-kenway/3005-25756/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25756\">Edward Kenway </a>(grandfather of AC III's bland protagonist <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/connor-kenway/3005-22428/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22428\">Connor</a>), is a dashing fellow more in the tradition of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ezio-auditore-da-firenze/3005-10269/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10269\">Ezio</a> than any other Assassin's Creed hero. Interestingly, Edward's affiliation with the Assassins guild is far more tenuous than other characters in the series. He begins the game by assuming the identity of a traitor Assassin, whom Edward ran across during the course of a naval battle. This Assassin had been working with the Templars to try and locate the Observatory, a mysterious First Civilization structure that houses a technology both the Assassins and Templars have a particular interest in.</p><p style=\"\">Unsurprisingly, Edward finds himself caught between both the Assassins and Templars as they track a sage--a reincarnated being who has specific knowledge of the Observatory and its location--and try to prevent the opposing side from getting their hands on the Observatory's revelatory technology. However, Edward's interests are far more base at the outset. Being a pirate of minimal renown early on, Edward sees this Observatory as an epic treasure to plunder. All he wants is money and status, which is certainly in keeping with the game's piratical themes. However, he seeks these riches primarily in the hopes of winning back his estranged wife, who he left back in England when he began his privateering career.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/75926/2571790-assassin%27s+creed+iv+%28pc%29+2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2571790\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/75926/2571790-assassin%27s+creed+iv+%28pc%29+2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2571790\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/75926/2571790-assassin%27s+creed+iv+%28pc%29+2.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/75926/2571790-assassin%27s+creed+iv+%28pc%29+2.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Each land area features the many different synch points, side missions, and other hidden treasure you'd expect, but they're spread out across a huge chunk of oceanic territory, and finding everything will take quite a lot of doing.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Over the course of Edward's adventure, you'll meet numerous rogues of pirate history, including the fearsome <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/blackbeard/3005-20205/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20205\">Blackbeard</a>, the pirate-turned-pirate hunter <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/benjamin-hornigold/3005-28085/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28085\">Benjamin Hornigold</a>, the \"Gentleman Pirate\" Stede Bonnet, and two of the most famous female pirates of the era in <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mary-read/3005-28089/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28089\">Mary Read</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/anne-bonny/3005-28084/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28084\">Anne Bonny</a>. Each of these real historical figures brushes up against Edward's adventure in one chapter or another, and the story is filled with lots of great character moments from each. In that very Assassin's Creed way, Edward ends up acting more as a cipher to experience the camaraderies and cozenages that take place between these characters. And that ends up being just fine, honestly. Edward has enough of a character arc to keep him interesting on his own merits, and the interactions he has with those great names of the high seas--especially Blackbeard and Read--are nicely done. There are definitely moments where the script ends up leaping around in time more than you'd perhaps prefer, especially when it skips over what seems like key character moments for the sake of getting you to the next major moment in the Observatory hunt. But what is there works about as well as you could hope for.</p><p style=\"\">You might be wondering at this point how Black Flag inserts itself into the modern-day element of the Assassin's Creed franchise. How it chooses to occupy the space left behind by previous present-day protagonist Desmond Miles is interesting, if a bit slight. Hilariously, you play as a sort of personality-less developer hired to work at Abstergo Entertainment, the video game development arm of the Templars' all-purpose evil corporation. Your job is to enter the Animus to plug away at Edward's memories in order to find the location of the Observatory. In between all the Animusing, you'll find yourself in the company of both an overly upbeat project manager whose niceness barely masks a total disinterest in your wellbeing, and a shady IT director who cajoles you into running illicit errands that often involve hacking various Abstergo computers. Essentially, this whole section of the game is a series of hacking minigames followed by storyline infodumps you get from the files you acquire via the aforementioned hacking. Some of the revelations that come from those files fill in a few of the blanks about what's been going on since the end of AC III, but the actual story beats of that section don't offer much beyond a moderately interesting \"aha!\" twist at the end. Fortunately, this stuff makes up only a small fraction of the actual time you spend playing Assassin's Creed IV, and even at their worst, these sections are just a bit dull.</p><p style=\"\">Once you have finished Edward's quest, you can of course simply return to the high seas to take care of any lingering objectives, or you can delve into the multiplayer suite, which is largely what you've come to expect from an Assassin's Creed game. In fact, apart from a few variances, there isn't really too much new here beyond what was included in Assassin's Creed III. Fortunately, it all seemed to work pretty well in the matches I played. The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> also has an \"exclusive\" additional mission section (that will apparently also be released for <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>) featuring <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed-iii-liberation/3030-38507/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38507\">Assassin's Creed III: Liberation</a> heroine <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/aveline-de-grandpre/3005-23439/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23439\">Aveline</a>. Here, she's tasked with tracking down a captured slave in a short story that, sadly, doesn't do much of anything to further the character. I liked Aveline in Liberation, despite the fact that the game seemed to almost purposely skimp on fleshing out her backstory and motivations. Here you don't even get any significant character moments at all, and the content ends up just being a few more sneak-and-stab missions among the many you'll already play in the main game, albeit with a different character.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495908-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495908\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495908-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495908\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495908-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_003.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495908-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_003.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed IV looks amazing on the PlayStation 4 hardware.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I played through Assassin's Creed IV entirely on the PlayStation 4, so while I can't directly compare it to the other versions out there, I can say that this version looks pretty spectacular. Both on land and at sea, the game's artists have crafted some pretty awesome looking scenery. Crashing your boat into a rogue wave and watching the water sweep over the deck of your boat, seeing ships in the distance explode after you deliver a well-placed cannon shot, and simply taking in the gorgeous vistas as you perch atop the many synch points spread throughout the game, are just a few of the many visual highlights I can recall. The animation quality is top-notch too. Occasionally you'll see the kinds of weird quirks inherent to this series, like downed enemies glitching out due to wonky ragdoll physics, or the occasional character lifting a weapon that appears not to have actually loaded in their hands. But where the most detail and work has clearly gone--namely into Edward, his cohorts, and their various combat animations--the game looks terrific. It all runs great too, with only minimal frame rate dips in rare instances.</p><p style=\"\">In some respects, it's perhaps reasonable to say that Assassin's Creed IV is the game that Assassin's Creed III should have been. Which is not to say that a game set in the Revolutionary War should have featured pirates and extended sailing sequences, but rather to acknowledge that the many game systems featured in AC III feel more fleshed out here, and appear better-suited to Black Flag's campaign. Its larger open world setting certainly helps, but an open world is only as good as the stories, characters, and activities you populate it with, and Black Flag's world is one I found myself coming back to again and again not just out of editorial requirement. That Black Flag's association with the Assassin's Creed franchise at times feels kind of tangential should really only be distressing to hardcore franchise fans desperate to see where the ongoing strife between Assassins and Templars is headed. For those who just like the idea of a game in which sailing and stabbing exist in harmony across a vast ocean of entertaining objectives, Black Flag most definitely delivers the goods.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>", "deck": "Black Flag takes a sharp left turn from the series' traditional progression, but the ways in which it diverges are what make it one of the most purely entertaining games in the franchise.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-617/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41518/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag/3030-41518/", "id": 41518, "name": "Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2013-12-03 14:37:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-125702/", "id": 125702, "name": "Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/forza-motorsport-5-review/1900-618/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495339-forza5_e3_screenshot_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495339\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495339-forza5_e3_screenshot_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495339\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2495339-forza5_e3_screenshot_13.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Forza Motorsport 5 contains many shiny cars for you to bang up and cover in dings, scrapes, and scratches.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/forza-motorsport-5/3030-42693/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42693\">Forza Motorsport 5</a> should be a triumph. It's the latest installment in a well-liked, well-made simulation racing series, and the driving itself is as good as it's ever been. Actually, the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>'s rumbling trigger technology helps to make the driving <em>even better</em> by giving you more feedback about things like traction and helping you determine if you're over-accelerating or not. But everything surrounding that great driving experience chips away at that ideal driving scenario until you're left with a disappointing shame.</p><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/forza-motorsport/3025-199/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-199\">Forza</a> series has evolved over the years to get better and better at appealing to dopes like me, who want a certain level of assistance with the simulation aspects of driving, while still offering things that better resemble the reality of driving fast cars for people who don't. Forza 5 duplicates most of the options found in the previous games, including those various assist options that let you get assisted braking (which is no fun), traction control (which I probably wouldn't play the game without), or cosmetic damage. Typically, if I'm going to spend a lot of time with a Forza game, I start at the highest levels of assistance and graduate up to more difficult situations as I go. This element of the game is intact and works as advertised. The act of driving a car in Forza 5 feels roughly how it felt in <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/forza-motorsport-4/3030-33400/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33400\">Forza 4</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/forza-motorsport-3/3030-24995/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24995\">3</a>. You are, however, given more information about how your car is handling through the Xbox One's triggers, which can rumble independently from the rest of the controller. It's a nice addition.</p><p style=\"\">In the game's career mode you'll face off against <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">AI</a>-controlled drivers, as before. You can set the difficulty rating of these opponents, but this time around they're based on the other Forza players on your friends list. The game collects data as you and your friends drive to build an AI profile, which the game clumsily calls a \"drivatar.\" Thus, your AI profile is eventually supposed to mimic the way you take corners, how aggressive you are on the track, and so on. In practice, this has led to a game in which a large number of the racers on the track are immediately trying to run me off the road. Or maybe they're just leaving the track on their own, weaving around like a bunch of drunks. Even the \"car guys\" on my friends list--people I certainly would expect to maintain a certain level of decorum in any sort of racing game--bang around the track with some amount of recklessness. If the goal was to make the single-player career feel more lifelike, then it's mission accomplished, for sure. But instead of making it look or feel like a real-life race would, it makes it feel like a public lobby multiplayer race, where half the field, a bunch of goons with nothing to lose, bangs into the first turn at full speed and hopes for the best. I can't imagine that's what the developer was going for. Either way, this style of AI casts a dark shadow over the entire career mode. Once you know what to expect, it's manageable, and it certainly makes the game more challenging than it has been in the past, but I felt like I was being forced to drive aggressively and do way more rubbin' and way less racin' to succeed.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2577425-getphoto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2577425\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2577425-getphoto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2577425\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/26/2577425-getphoto.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It might not have as many cars as some of the previous entries, but the important one is here.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As you might expect, the online side of the game is built to let you compete against actual humans instead of their shambling, crash-happy ghosts. But this section of the game is cordoned off into what feels like a billion different segments. So if you want to race A-class cars, there's a separate player matching hopper than there is for C-class cars. This is all fine and good, since people will almost certainly want to race specific cars that are suited to their own tastes, but it also meant that I had a hard time finding more than two or three other humans to race against. The developers have responded to this with a \"beginner\" playlist that lives on the first page you see when you hit the multiplayer menu, and one time I was able to get in a race with five or six others. The lack of a \"I don't care what you put me in, just let me drive against people\" button is pretty frustrating. You can, of course, round up some friends and get into a private match, but at that point you're dealing with the Xbox One's train wreck of a party interface, so there's no winning here.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">While we're piling on, let's talk about <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/microtransaction/3015-199/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-199\">post-release payment opportunities</a>, which are poured across all of Forza Motorsport 5 like a thin layer of slime. It's certainly all optional, and you're welcome to race the career as intended and unlock all of the vehicles the \"old\" way. But when every pre-race screen contains not one but two reminders that you could accelerate your earnings by purchasing a time-limited double XP boost, it begins to feel like a free-to-play phone game. On top of that, you can sign up for \"VIP membership\" for an additional $20, and in addition to giving you access to an additional set of cars, it also gives you the equivalent of a free-to-play game's \"coin doubler.\" Whenever you earn enough experience points to gain a level, you earn a bounty of credits, which are used to buy new cars and upgrade existing ones. If you're a VIP, that number of credits is doubled. Plain and simple. Like previous Forza games, FM5 even has a secondary currency, called tokens, much like a free-to-play game might. You can use these tokens to buy that double XP boost and cars. The token prices for cars are tied to the credit prices, which ends up making some individual vehicles insanely expensive. The developer has been out there after launch to state that it's reevaluating the overall economy in an attempt to head off some of the early criticism, but more than anything else, all of this just feels nasty. It's a full-priced, $60 game that has another limited edition option that went on sale for $80. Remember, it's all optional, and this certainly isn't the only game to ever offer a variety of shortcuts in the form of post-release payments. But the way the game is constantly reminding you of these additional payment schemes just feels dirty, and it cheapens the experience. Previous games in the series gave you cars as rewards for gaining a level. Forza 5 gives you credits that you can double by paying an additional fee.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2577427-getphoto-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2577427\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2577427-getphoto-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2577427\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2577427-getphoto-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2577427-getphoto-1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You ladies need a ride?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At least it looks great.

The Autovista mode lets you walk around the cars in a showroom and view the interiors, but you can't get under the hood, which is unfortunate. Photo mode and the ability to paint, customize, and tune cars is also largely intact, though the system for distributing paint jobs has changed a bit. Overall it delivers a solid sense of speed and usually looks fantastic.</p><p style=\"\">It looks great and it drives well. Given the Forza pedigree and the aplomb with which it nails those two things, this should be a fantastic game, the best Forza yet. Most of the pieces are there.

Live hasn't been a very good basketball simulation for close to a decade, but there were enough entries in the early 2000s that more or less justified the franchise's continued existence and kept the NBA licensing game competitive, especially with then-and-current top dog <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/2k-sports/3010-1860/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1860\">2K Sports'</a> <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k/3025-498/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-498\">NBA 2K</a> series. Then things started going downhill, and a few years back, EA tried to reboot the franchise as <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-elite-11/3030-31438/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31438\">NBA Elite</a> with an all-new engine and all the expected trimmings. It was a disaster. EA cancelled the title just days before it was expected to hit store shelves. A few copies did slip out into the wild, and the resulting YouTube videos showcased what looked to be the nadir of an already downtrodden franchise, a game so distressingly broken that EA would rather take a bath on scrapping what it had rather than dare to let the public see what horrors it had wrought.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2578921-nbalive14_ps4_kyrie_irving_pass.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578921\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2578921-nbalive14_ps4_kyrie_irving_pass.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578921\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2578921-nbalive14_ps4_kyrie_irving_pass.jpg\"></a><figcaption>NBA Live is back, I guess. Yay?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">How mortifying was the NBA Elite experience? Bad enough that it's taken EA three years to try the NBA thing again. Originally it was supposed to be two, but then another year went by before the company was able to finally conjure up <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-live-14/3030-42864/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42864\">NBA Live 14</a>. With so much time between the Elite boondoggle and now, you'd hope that EA would have been able to come up with at least one revelatory feature, one thing that would make it stand out from its oft-praised competitor. Instead, NBA Live 14 is a game that feels tentative at every turn, a game that feels preoccupied with mere functionality, versus anything even resembling innovation. The core tenets, strategies, and mechanics of the game of basketball are all represented here in thoroughly unspectacular fashion. It has the skeletal structures of modes you'd expect in a modern sports game, but none of the depth, detail, or excitement necessary to make them fun. It's as flat and flavorless a representation of professional basketball as I can ever remember seeing.</p><p style=\"\">This is apparent from the moment you boot up NBA Live 14 and jump into a game. From the opening tip-off, Live's malformed player models, clunky animations, and peculiarly suspect frame rate (especially on the PS4 version) all immediately gather up to greet you and let you know you've made an unfortunate purchase. Even if you discount the astoundingly good player models in <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k14/3030-42632/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42632\">NBA 2K14</a>, NBA Live 14 doesn't look like it was developed for new console hardware. When you do factor in the competition, NBA Live 14 looks downright tragic. Few faces seem to resemble their real-life counterparts, and most players have this stiff, gangly look to them that gives them an altogether unnerving quality.</p><p style=\"\">The one big, new-ish feature EA has touted for this game is its BounceTek system, essentially a buzzword for its right-stick-based dribbling system. Strangely, the game has no useful tutorial to explain how this system works. The only tutorial, actually, is a short, baffling afterthought of a video that just shows you that it <em>has</em> three tiers of complexity, without ever actually <em>demonstrating</em> how to best take advantage of said complexities. That BounceTek system actually does work reasonably well (once you research how it actually works, then learn the appropriate timing), but the fact that I had to wander into <a href=\"http://www.easports.com/nba-live/news-updates-gameplay/article/nba-live-14-gameplay\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">EA's official blog</a> to get any useful info on how it works is kind of ridiculous.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">While you might be able to get the hang of BounceTek's timing, a bigger issue is that everything else in NBA Live 14 constantly feels a step behind your reaction time. In-game animations are programmed so haphazardly that it constantly feels like the game is lagging behind whatever you've just asked it to do. Want to try to trip up a defender by playing around with the right-analog stick dribbling, change direction, then try to cut through to the paint on a layup? You can do that, but you basically have to wait for each movement to complete before putting in the next move, which takes considerably longer than one would expect. You have to be careful about it too, otherwise you'll probably accidentally make your guy do about seven other things you didn't intend because you hit the buttons over and over again wondering why the game wasn't responding to your presses.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495675-kyrie_eanbtr_still005_withwatermark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495675\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495675-kyrie_eanbtr_still005_withwatermark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495675\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495675-kyrie_eanbtr_still005_withwatermark.jpg\"></a><figcaption>No aspect of NBA Live 14's gameplay feels correct. The timing for everything you do feels well behind the kind of quick responses you need to play basketball effectively.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This isn't just an issue of spamming commands and the game not responding, but more a matter of having to constantly wait for the game to catch up to the pace on the court. Did you just swipe the ball out of an offensive player's hand, and would you like to run up and grab it and take it down the lane for a fast break? Terrific, first you'll have to wait for both players to finish their peculiarly long \"ball just fell out of a player's hand\" animation, then watch both players stumble around for a second, then you'll have to try and direct your player's momentum in the direction of the ball, wait a half-second for him to pick it up, then wait another second for him to transition into his dribbling animation, and--oh, whoops! The entire opposing defense already got set at the other end of the court. Too bad! These sorts of momentum killing situations are everywhere in NBA Live 14. Your reaction time will almost always be quicker than what the game is capable of responding to. In a game as quickly paced as basketball, not being able to make effective moves on the fly is straight-up inexcusable.</p><p style=\"\">It's a mess made messier by a host of other small, nagging gameplay issues. Camera problems are prevalent under several different settings, with some instances of the camera just straight up refusing to move back down the court with you until you take a timeout or switch the camera to a different setting entirely. Until you get very good at using the BounceTek to fake defenders out, defending players stick to you like glue, only occasionally leaving an opening if they inexplicably decide to all converge in the paint (leaving multiple open players on the perimeter) or if they just decide to fall over for no identifiable reason whatsoever. Trying to set up pick-and-rolls--or, really, just about anything that doesn't involve you tossing the ball to your biggest guy and hoping he can score in the paint--is a deeply frustrating experience that repeated practice and unending patience never quite manage to improve. You don't get better at NBA Live 14 so much as you just learn how better to exploit it.</p><p style=\"\">There is nothing here to justify learning how to exploit it, mind you. This game is not very much fun in any facet of its execution, and the supporting modes don't make the crappy basketball-playing any better. The game's franchise mode is so bare-bones it might as well have been decomposing in a desert for a century, and the Rising Star mode--essentially the game's answer to NBA 2K's MyCareer mode--is, at best, a sketch of a good idea. Here, you just make your own player using some basic presets, get drafted by a team (whether they actually need a player at your position or not), and then proceed to play a bunch of games while trying to earn good grades for achieving vague objectives. There's no storyline here, nor anything to really keep you interested beyond the notion of just playing a player you created and trying not to suck enough to get decent grades. Mostly, it's just dull, with a dash of the infuriating when your AI teammates suddenly go full-lobotomy and just sit there with the ball, dribbling until the shot clock goes down to almost nothing. You can call for a pass whenever that happens, but it happens so often that you often end up in a situation where you have to constantly prod your team into doing much of anything. Incidentally, this happens in any situation where the game locks you to a single player. It seems like Live's A.I. just isn't programmed to respond intelligently to having to move the ball around itself, as opposed to having player control switch from player-to-player as you pass it.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578923\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"720\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578923\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>I like the implementation of NBA Live 14's live season mode--it's just a shame you have to actually play NBA Live 14 to take advantage of it.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While these modes are merely dull, online play is straight-up garbage. Lag is constant, making an already unwieldy game that much more infuriating. Every game I played devolved into free-for-alls where all anyone could do was try to throw players toward the paint and hope the animation for a halfway makeable shot would happen. Timing on any other kind of shot is so horrid that you simply can't rely on them. If by some miracle you are able to start draining threes or making free-throws with any consistency, then you are probably some kind of server lag wizard and your powers should be put to use on better games than this one.</p><p style=\"\">I suppose there are some positives worth lauding in NBA Live 14. Its live season mode, which regularly updates the game with challenges based on scenarios taking place during the current NBA season, is well-implemented and seems to be getting updated very quickly. Ultimate Team is about as solid as any other implementation of the concept in EA's other sports titles this year (though it maddeningly lacks the auction feature found in every other game), and I did think the game's broadcast presentation--namely its pre-game and halftime stat overlays and solid (if deeply repetitive) commentary from Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy--was pretty good. Unfortunately, these few bright spots aren't nearly enough to make NBA Live 14 appear as anything but a perfunctory, depressing mess. Yes, EA is making basketball games again, and perhaps that's a good thing, given that competition generally pushes developers to do more interesting things than they would otherwise. But if NBA Live 14 is any indication, it's going to be a long time before 2K Sports needs to acknowledge, let alone worry about, what EA's up to.</p>", "deck": "NBA Live 14 is a pretty lousy basketball game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-619/", "platforms": "Xbox One, PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42864/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nba-live-14/3030-42864/", "id": 42864, "name": "NBA Live 14"}, "score": 1, "publish_date": "2013-12-11 16:16:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-129745/", "id": 129745, "name": "NBA Live 14"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-banner-saga-review/1900-620/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-banner-saga/3030-37629/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37629\">The Banner Saga </a>is a game of both terrific beauty and desperate misery.

The Banner Saga is grim, bordering on hopeless at times, so it's a credit to its mechanics and art design that the game never feels particularly punishing to play.

No, The Banner Saga doesn't dig into <em>actual</em> Norse mythology, but its hardscrabble heroes are clearly inspired by the Nordic warriors of old. The mythology here finds a world previously decimated by massive wars, long-dead gods, and a seething mistrust between the two primary races. The smaller, more obviously familiar humans live in scattered settlements and cities alongside the giant, behorned varl, a race defined primarily by its largeness and exceptionally long lifespan. Neither race much trusts one another, but a tentative alliance has kept things peaceful since the old days of war against the race of stone-demons known as the dredge. Not long into The Banner Saga's opening, the dredge return mysteriously, pouring over the land in volume the likes of which even the oldest varl can't recall ever seeing. Immediately villages are overwhelmed, people are driven from their homes, and it's up to you to find a way to save as many as you can.</p><p style=\"\">You'll play The Banner Saga from multiple perspectives, including a human clan led by an archer named Rook, and a caravan of varl and humans led by one of the few diplomatically minded varl you'll meet. In either situation, you'll find yourself leading a group from place to place, scavenging for supplies, fighting dredge, and slowly putting the pieces together on why the dredge have returned, why the sun has stopped moving across the sky, and why a shroud of darkness has begun to cover the whole of the world.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, The Banner Saga only gets around to actually answering a couple of those questions. Much of the game's plot is dedicated to introducing you quite a few different characters, many of which become playable members of your party as you trudge across the icy wasteland. Some of these characters are legitimately interesting personalities, while others offer less distinctive voices, making their presences occasionally confusing during larger conversations. The game's script is mostly judicious about who it inserts into what situation, but it's almost entirely unvoiced (outside of a few narrated chapter intros) and that makes trying to differentiate some of the very similarly mannered characters a bit of a pain when you're clicking through the various conversations. This is also not a very long game. I completed it in something like nine hours, and while it mostly makes good use of the time it has, its conclusion makes the events that preceded it feel like a lot of table-setting for a much bigger, <em>even more</em> arduous conflict later down the road, rather than a satisfying wrap-up of its own stand-alone tale. It's a little like watching <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> if you weren't already aware there were going to be more sequels coming.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Still, I liked a lot of what The Banner Saga aims for in terms of crafting its world and those that inhabit it. Some clunky dialogue here and there aside, many of the characters you're presented with demonstrate nuance in their motivations, despite the perpetually crumbling world around them not exactly allowing for many opportunities for subtle character-building. Even as the game falls further and further into its apocalyptic abyss, the key personalities of the story remain engaging, keeping you transfixed on their tale, even as the circumstances become more and more ominous.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2591272-screenhunter_640+jan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591272\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.61492046077894\" data-width=\"1823\" style=\"width: 1823px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2591272-screenhunter_640+jan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591272\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2591272-screenhunter_640+jan.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Battles take place on various grids like this, and follows a turn-based progression.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I don't think I'm overselling the dire nature of The Banner Saga's story, though I'll concede that a good chunk of that misery comes from the fact that you are the one forced to make the hard decisions around all this tragedy. Most of these come from simple dialogue trees that pop up in primary conversations, but you'll also constantly be making plenty of smaller, yet still important, decisions that greatly affect how your game progresses. You see, The Banner Saga breaks up its combat and plot points with a traveling system not all that dissimilar from <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-oregon-trail/3030-17852/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17852\">The Oregon Trail</a>. As you move from place to place, you'll be bringing along a caravan of warriors and clansmen that must be properly maintained, lest your people begin dying off along the path. Essentially, you have to balance your store of supplies against the need to keep healthy morale among your people, which you gain by resting along the way. You'll have opportunities on the road to scavenge for additional supplies, take on new members of the caravan, and even find a few extra items to buff your warriors with, but those situations can often just as easily go wrong, leading to lost supplies, sickness, and very often death for those around you.</p><p style=\"\">The health and morale of your caravan must additionally be balanced against your need to improve the warriors in your party. The only way you'll be able to upgrade them is by taking on the hordes of dredge that seem to appear at every turn, as well as the occasional band of human brigands or renegade varl. Winning in battle earns you renown, the game's only currency. You use renown to upgrade your warriors in the usual stats like strength and armor, as well as willpower. Willpower is a special, stackable trait that lets warriors move further on the battlefield, as well as enact stronger attacks. Incidentally, renown is also the currency you use to purchase supplies for your caravan, so you constantly find yourself having to decide if having extra days worth of a healthy caravan is worth having potentially underpowered fighters in the next battle. And keeping morale in a good place helps too, since having extremely low morale will cost you penalties during battles.</p><p style=\"\">About that battle system. Fights take place on a grid, using a turn-based system that rewards careful strategy. You'll have a half-dozen or so warriors available per fight, which is usually enough to take on the hordes of dredge, highwaymen, and whatever else you come in contact with. Each main warrior has their own particular skillset, though there are several character classes that each fighter pulls from. Which is to say nothing of the major differences between the humans and varl's skillsets. Varl, as you might imagine, are lumbering hulks that do lots of damage but aren't necessarily the most nimble nor defensive-minded fighters, while humans can use a greater variety of weapons, like bows, spears, and small axes. Creating a strong party that balances attackers and supporting players is generally key to victory.</p><p style=\"\">It's an intriguing system, one that I managed to pick up the particulars of fairly quickly. If there's a flaw here, it's that there regrettably isn't much variety to the combat scenarios you're presented. You spend most of the game just fighting the dredge, who certainly have some differing fighter classes, but not enough to make any engagement with them feel much different from another, outside of a few random (but not unmanageable) difficulty spikes. Some of that sameness is offset by the fact that the combat system itself is fairly fun and just complicated enough to require some thinking, without being too complicated for an average player to dive into. Samey as they might be, fights are often enjoyably challenging. I guess I just wish more time were dedicated to throwing some unexpected wrinkles into the combat situations. The traversal system offers up a pretty solid variety of situations and choices for the player to make over the course of the game. It's just a small shame that the combat system, as vital to the game's progression as it is, doesn't quite follow suit.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2591276-screenhunter_639+jan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591276\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.61496149614961\" data-width=\"1818\" style=\"width: 1818px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2591276-screenhunter_639+jan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591276\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2591276-screenhunter_639+jan.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2591276-screenhunter_639+jan.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Did I mention how incredible this game looks? I did? Well, I'm mentioning it again.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One aspect of The Banner Saga I have no qualms with whatsoever is its art. Evoking the hand-drawn art of animation's \"dark age,\" The Banner Saga features exquisite character art, gorgeous landscapes, and tons of small visual flourishes that combine into a spectacular looking world. It's worth noting that the game doesn't feature a ton of actual animation, outside of battle scenes and some lightly animated cutscenes, but it doesn't really matter. The mostly static images that make up the conversation and overworld sequences are drawn so wonderfully that they do plenty to suck you into the game's snow-bleached world. That art is underscored brilliantly by another terrific soundtrack from <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/austin-wintory/3040-82905/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-82905\">Austin Wintory</a>, which perfectly captures the game's overall aesthetic in audio form.</p><p style=\"\">I expect that phenomenal art and audio will go a long way toward making people forget about some of The Banner Saga's less developed elements. It certainly did so for me. I was too busy admiring the visuals, carefully considering each conversation, and plotting out battle strategies during the course of the game. It was only after I'd finished that I was left to consider the sometimes monotonous fights, the regrettably cliffhanging conclusion, and the overall bleakness of the game's worldview. Still, none of those considerations diminished my enjoyment at the time, and in retrospect, the worst thing I can say about The Banner Saga is that I wanted a lot more of it. That might sound like an odd thing to say about a game that digs its players into a place of nonstop hardship and treachery, a world where death and despair are the only constant, and hope seems utterly lost in the dark behind an unmoving sun.

He's like most other dads, except for the part where he's an octopus. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Of course, this premise was initially established in 2010's Octodad, a student-developed IGF entry which is still available free of cost on the <a href=\"http://www.octodadgame.com/games/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Octodad website</a>. However, while that game was more like an elongated cartoon sketch, Dadliest Catch fleshes out the betentacled hero's back story while adding several more ridiculous situations and objectives for the player to engage in. For much of Dadliest Catch's playtime, everything works in a kind of chaotic harmony, creating comedy out of every day situations that are, unsurprisingly, ludicrously challenging for a cephalopod in a suit. Unfortunately, the game doesn't quite stick the landing, as its last act gets bogged down by irritating objectives while trying to wrap up the character's arc a bit too hastily.</p><p style=\"\">But before you get there, there's a lot of goofy fun to be had with Dadliest Catch's early goings. The game opens with Octodad frantically trying to prepare for his wedding. This opening level perfectly establishes the basics of everything that comes afterward. You quickly learn Octodad's limb control system, which requires you to independently control his legs and his right arm through careful control stick/mouse movements. You'll be tasked with simple goals like picking up objects, opening doors, putting on clothes, and the like. Thrashing around too much or destroying too much scenery will cause humans to become suspicious of you--nevermind that your head is yellow and your limbs have suction cups attached to them, of course. Your suspicion level is dictated via a meter at the bottom of the screen, but fortunately, only the most outrageous behavior will cause it to rise sharply. You can create a fair amount of accidental (or intentional, I suppose) carnage before you have to worry about any real consequences.</p><p style=\"\">That's good, because half the joy of the game is just watching Octodad's ridiculous attempts at normal behavior go awry. Grabbing and holding anything with your right \"arm\" most often results in a variety of objects being knocked around, and even just trying to position Octodad into the places required to achieve objectives is an effort unto itself. It's worth noting that for a game that's largely about wild limb gesticulation, it controls pretty well. It can be a bit flustering when an arm just doesn't seem to want to line up with an object you're trying to grab, or your legs won't navigate around objects as easily as you might like, but most of the game's early levels don't require you to do anything too strenuous anyway. For instance, the second chapter just revolves around Octodad getting out of bed, making coffee, and doing some light household chores. The challenge of accomplishing those tasks is entirely baked into the goofy control scheme and the resulting destruction.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187985/2468016-octodad_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2468016\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2048\" style=\"width: 2048px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187985/2468016-octodad_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2468016\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/18/187985/2468016-octodad_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It is extremely difficult to get Octodad to do much of anything without wrecking most of the objects in your vicinity, but then, that's the point.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's simple, but smartly designed stuff, underpinned by terrific visuals and some sharply written dialogue. Octodad doesn't really speak so much as he blubs in highly specific tones as his human wife, son, and daughter all try to converse with him. The set-ups for these exchanges are all pretty great, and go a long way toward making Octodad into a more endearing character, especially in the opening chapters of the game. It's in these sections that you can most plainly see the slapstick inspirations of the game's premise. In these parts, Octodad almost feels like a lost Warner Bros. cartoon character, forced to try and maintain his double life, all while the aforementioned crazed foreign chef tries in increasingly desperate and homicidal ways to convince everyone else of Octodad's true identity.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's how Dadliest Catch chooses to pay off this premise toward the end that the game ultimately falters. Much is made early on about Octodad's aversion to the local aquarium (for obvious reasons), but eventually he ends up there with his family anyway. This section starts out nicely, with Octodad spending time with each member of his family in a different section of the aquarium, playing some minigames and bonding with his kids (and trying desperately to distract his wife from asking too many questions about his past). But then things take a weird turn. A flashback sequence takes you to a fishing boat and the first moments of Octodad's false identity, and it all plays out as, of all things, a stealth sequence. Dadliest Catch controls just fine when you're just trying to do simple chores or navigate around some elaborately designed environments, but when you have to try and actively avoid anyone spotting you, there are just too many variables to navigate to avoid obnoxious bouts of trial-and-error. Everything up to this point is pretty breezy and silly, but suddenly the game is asking you to be more precise and sneaky in your movements, and it doesn't really work.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, the entire back third of the game is like this. The last two chapters require more stealth, attack dodging, and careful (yet quick) platform navigation, none of which line up well with how the game actually controls. These sequences aren't impossible by any means, but they're far more frustrating than the lightweight goofs of the early game, and often it feels like you're succeeding more on accident than through any actual mastery of the controls. It doesn't help that the story takes a strange turn around this time as well, one that is surprisingly willing to abandon the whole \"secret octopus\" concept the game was, up to this point, entirely predicated upon.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187985/2468022-sequence+01_14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2468022\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187985/2468022-sequence+01_14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2468022\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/187985/2468022-sequence+01_14.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/18/187985/2468022-sequence+01_14.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It's short, sometimes frustrating, and ends a little weird, but Octodad: Dadliest Catch is too charming not to recommend.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If I'm especially disappointed by these parts of Dadliest Catch, it's because the first couple of hours are so good. These opening chapters are ridiculous and delightful, a wonderful blend of purposely ramshackle control and physics-based insanity. Yes, the game is only about three hours long on a single playthrough, provided you aren't painstakingly picking through every environment looking for secret ties or bonny hats to decorate Octodad with. It being a short game is hardly a terrible thing by itself--in fact, too many hours of just crashing through environments probably would have gotten old after a point. The issue is that the game doesn't always make the best use of the time it has. It loses both narrative and comic momentum as it ambles toward its conclusion, which makes those frustrating gameplay sections sting all the more.</p><p style=\"\">Still, in spite of its issues toward the end, I enjoyed more than enough of Dadliest Catch to recommend it. When this game is at its best, it's exquisitely silly, genuinely funny, and even kind of sweet, in its own demented way. There's certainly reason to go back and play through it again, including a strange, but clever co-op mode (in which up to four players can control different parts of Octodad's body), and Steam Workshop support for user-made levels. Even when it falters, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a likable game. It's only disappointing by virtue of the fact that with a few of its design and story quirks worked out, it could have been a <em>lovable</em> game instead.</p>", "deck": "Some late-game issues not withstanding, Dadliest Catch is a charming, bizarre, genuinely likable little game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-621/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35877/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/octodad-dadliest-catch/3030-35877/", "id": 35877, "name": "Octodad: Dadliest Catch"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-01-30 10:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-132736/", "id": 132736, "name": "Octodad: Dadliest Catch"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/jazzpunk-review/1900-622/", "description": "<p style=\"\">It's a rare, but fantastic thing to find a game that feels like the result of a singular artistic vision.

The good kind, I mean.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In it, you are Polyblank, a sort of freelance spy for an agency that runs espionage jobs for just about anyone, it seems. Your shifty drunk of a boss feeds you Missionoyl pills to send you out on assignments that always sound like spy game boilerplate on paper, but descend into complete and utter insanity almost instantly upon your arrival. Describing that insanity is challenging, because so much of Jazzpunk's comedy comes not from individual conversations or situations, but from the breakneck pace at which it fires off the stupidest, most unpredictable happenings it can muster. Think of the rhythms of comedies like <em>Airplane!</em> or <em>The Naked Gun</em>, but with a far more brazenly psychedelic bent.</p><p style=\"\">What's impressive about Jazzpunk's unusual brand of comedy is that it actively lets the player participate in the nonsense happening around them. Funny things aren't just said and done in front of you. You are invited to poke and prod at every strange piece of this world until every ounce of funny has been extracted. In some respects, Jazzpunk resembles something like <a href=\"/gone-home/3030-38327/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38327\" data-mce-href=\"/gone-home/3030-38327/\">Gone Home</a>, or<a href=\"/blendo-games/3010-7124/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7124\" data-mce-href=\"/blendo-games/3010-7124/\"> Blendo Games</a>' <a href=\"/thirty-flights-of-loving/3030-37702/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37702\" data-mce-href=\"/thirty-flights-of-loving/3030-37702/\">Thirty Flights of Loving</a>. It's more about exploration and interacting with the world than straight-up task achievement. Each chapter of the game has specific objectives that must be met to proceed--steal back tech stolen by the Russians, acquire a cyber-kidney currently embedded in a mark, steal a briefcase from a vacationing target, and so on--but just going straight for those objectives misses the larger point of the game.</p><p style=\"\">In the first mission, I spent nearly 30 minutes just talking to the many crazy idiots that populate the world, performing bizarre side jobs for them, uncovering unseen minigames, and trying to touch every single touchable object to see what strange thing would pop out of it. What does pop out could range from one of a long list of peculiar lines of dialogue, to a playable, matrimonially-themed first-person shooter called Wedding Quake. Jazzpunk throws non sequiturs at you from every which way, and does so at such a rapid clip that there's scarcely ever time to process what you've just wandered into.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">And yet there is, astonishingly, a cohesive feel to all of this. Throwing a million silly gags out every which way is no surefire way to create successful comedy, but Jazzpunk manages to keep things unpredictable while retaining a sense of pace and rhythm. There is a consistency to its delivery, an unexpectedly focused style that makes all this more than just a bunch of thrown together funny-sounding words and visuals. Its aesthetic is coherent, if entirely odd, mixing together Cold War-era pop culture imagery with belligerently delivered spy movie tropes, and characters who all look like gender designations on restroom signs. It's all completely nuts, but in an extremely, amazingly specific way.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2567710-32.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2567710\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2567710-32.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2567710\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2567710-32.png\"></a><figcaption>Whatever Jazzpunk lacks in complexity, it more than makes up for in white-hot weirdness.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps because it involves the player so heavily in its punchlines, Jazzpunk mostly keeps things very simple. Those minigames? Never terribly difficult, nor deep. Those mission objectives? Usually quick and easy to accomplish. Also, you can't lose the game under any circumstances. That simplicity prevents any joke from being kneecapped by frustrating gameplay, but it also makes progressing through it a breeze. Playing with an eye toward finding every gag will probably take just a little under three hours, but it's not too likely you'll find all of them on your first play through. I happily went through Jazzpunk a second time, and found at least a half-dozen things I'd completely passed by the first time around. Even more importantly, I didn't mind playing through the jokes I had already seen a second time. Even without the surprise factor, they were still funny. That's a mark of any great comedy, regardless of what medium it originates from.</p><p style=\"\">To describe any more of Jazzpunk would be to its detriment. It's best experienced unawares, so that the full weight of its weirdness can be imparted without the burden of expectation. Suffice it to say I think just about everyone should play Jazzpunk, though I'll concede that its specific brand of humor might not jive with everyone's sensibilities. Frankly, you can watch just about any two minutes of Jazzpunk and probably know right away if it's for you or not. Every individual gag is its own bizarre thing, yet still feels like an accurate encapsulation of the greater whole. It takes a strong, creative, thoughtful comic voice to pull something like that off. In Jazzpunk, Necrophone Games has demonstrated that it has that voice, and it deserves to be heard.</p>", "deck": "Jazzpunk is beautiful, beguiling nonsense.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-622/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-44063/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/jazzpunk/3030-44063/", "id": 44063, "name": "Jazzpunk"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2014-02-07 11:08:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-132750/", "id": 132750, "name": "Jazzpunk"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-left-behind-review/1900-623/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Can you think of a game less in need of more story than <a href=\"/the-last-of-us/3030-36989/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36989\">The Last of Us</a>?

That the game didn't <em>need</em> any DLC makes Left Behind's elegant addition to its narrative arc all the more impressive. This is an essential add-on for anyone who treasured the intensely character-driven style of The Last of Us, and wants to spend just a few more moments in its world.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2602702-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602702\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2602702-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602702\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/30/2602702-02.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Left Behind shows you who Riley was, and what she meant to Ellie.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Left Behind doesn't offer any profound revelations about cordyceps, the Fireflies, or other background elements of The Last of Us' grim reality. True to the spirit of the base game, it merely gives form and adds texture to characters and themes that were hinted at in the original story. As such, it's deeply intertwined with the events of The Last of Us, so if you don't know what happens in that game and want to keep it that way, stop reading now.</p><p style=\"\">The DLC opens by revisiting that horrific moment when Joel is impaled on a metal rod, and then deftly shifts between the \"present,\" in which Ellie desperately makes her way through a shopping mall in search of medical supplies to stitch him up, and flashbacks to the time before Ellie was bitten, before she realized she was immune, when she shared a teenager's tumultuous but abiding affection with her best friend Riley. The filmic sensibilities that so enhanced the original game's presentation again work to great effect here, with hard cuts from one time period to the other coming at just the right moments, when the drama is at its height, to keep you intensely engaged in moving the plot forward.</p><p style=\"\">Ellie's present-day struggle through the Colorado mall is where all the fighting is. Left Behind wisely avoids laying on the combat too thick just to pad out its length; there are only a handful of enemy encounters spread evenly through the story, and what light puzzle-solving there is doesn't impede your progress for long (and you don't push any wooden pallets around in the water, thankfully). The game adds the neat twist of mixing human and infected enemies into the same scenarios, allowing you to pit them against each other with just a little creativity. This portion of the DLC is fairly straightforward, but even here Naughty Dog takes the opportunity to tell a short found story, similar to the Ish business in the original game, that resonates with Ellie and Joel's predicament.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2602712-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602712\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2602712-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602712\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/30/2602712-12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>One of the best moments in the whole DLC takes place right here.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's the flashbacks to a relatively more innocent time that give Left Behind its spark. After disappearing without explanation weeks earlier, Riley returns to drop in on Ellie and takes her on a heartfelt day trip through <em>another</em> shopping mall. Cue a bounty of wonderful character-building scenes and exchanges between the two, as they briefly get the mall's power up and running and then get a wistful glimpse of what life might have been like before the world ended. Thankfuly there's no combat in the flashback portion, just a lot of great talking and exploring through a costume shop, a music store, and a merry-go-round, among others. On several occasions, Left Behind makes fantastic, offbeat use of the game's existing mechanics that put a big, goofy grin on my face (and those moments are better experienced for yourself than described in a review). The flashback scenes are mostly playful, but there's an undercurrent of sadness and finality to it all that continually reminds you where this reunion must inevitably end up.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Having finished The Last of Us, you'll be somewhat familiar with who Riley was, but Left Behind solidifies her importance to the game's greater storyline and makes it clear how much she meant to Ellie, and the effect she had on Ellie's formative years. Their relationship is developed well enough during their short jaunt through the mall that you'll dread the conclusion that you know is coming. And telling Riley's story is what allows Left Behind to justify its other half, set in the present. It's not a mystery that Ellie had to strike out on her own to fix Joel up, but seeing firsthand what she's been through and lost makes you appreciate why she fights so hard to hang on to what she has left.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2602710-10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602710\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2602710-10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2602710\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/30/2602710-10.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/30/2602710-10.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Left Behind packs a lot of great moments into its short running time.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Some may knock Left Behind for its relative brevity, at two to three hours, but this is one of those clear cases of quality over quantity, and I for one appreciate an add-on that imparts a lot of narrative value to a game like this without overstaying its welcome. It's delightfully ironic that the one game which <em>really</em> didn't need any DLC has received one of the best pieces of DLC in recent memory.

It's thin on story, long on mashing the attack button, and a mostly satisfying endeavor that left me wishing that it had more of a plot or that more of the game required actual expertise and skill, rather than being able to mash your way through 90 percent of the game's combat.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2578283-024812.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578283\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2578283-024812.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578283\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/2578283-024812.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">There's no preamble to Strider. Launch the game and you'll quickly find yourself hang-gliding into Kazakh City and receiving one simple objective: \"Assassinate Grandmaster Meio.\" As you make your way around the city and into a handful of different areas, you'll get other sub-objectives to help you proceed, but finding Meio and putting his lights out is your goal. Along the way you'll get occasional (and annoying unstoppable, even on retries) dialogue from bosses, but other than telling you that your journey is about to end in defeat, most of the bosses don't have anything meaningful to say. It's just as well, as most of the voice work is average, at best.</p><p style=\"\">While the setting and many of the boss encounters are inspired directly by the arcade version of the game, the action is a bit more like the more-thoughtful <a href=\"/strider/3030-12558/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12558\">NES release</a> or, if you want to be modern about it, it's a <a href=\"/shadow-complex/3030-26706/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26706\">Shadow Complex</a>-like action-adventure where you earn abilities that help you enter previously inaccessible areas of the world. This gates access to later portions of the game and also gives you a reason to backtrack around the game to find doors that you weren't able to open the last time around. You'll get most of your major gear upgrades from boss encounters, and most of these are taken directly from the original game and given a few twists to bring them up a bit closer to modern standards. If nothing else, it's a pleasure to be able to fight a giant mechanical ape one more time, even if you can just run up next to it and mash the attack buttons to win.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2578291-024820.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578291\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2578291-024820.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578291\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9493/2578291-024820.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Most of the gear is very straightforward, though a set of plasma types for your standard sword attack let you deal explosive, ice, magnetic, or standard damage. Your standard attacks can also reflect bullets back at turrets and other armed enemies, once you've found the appropriate upgrade. Traversal doesn't change too much over the course of the game, though gaining the ability to double jump is certainly nice. It gives you an extra bit of maneuverability that freshens up the combat a bit, giving you a better way to dodge bullets. Of course, on normal difficulty you needn't bother. Running right at most enemies and bosses and swinging your sword as quickly as possible is typically the only strategy you need, and the game doesn't start throwing trickier boss encounters at you until the final third. Even the final boss is felled by some fairly remedial tactics. Keeping that in mind, you might want to bump it up to hard... but this seems to just tweak the damage numbers a bit and doesn't really make the game any more exciting.</p><p style=\"\">At times, Strider looks great, but it would benefit from some more environmental variety. Aside from some early bits on the rooftops and some airship shenanigans, most of the game is set in a series of fairly plain-looking facilities. Without many big landmarks to help you navigate, it's a good thing the game has an effective map, complete with color-coded doorways to help you figure out what it takes to open each door--handy when you're backtracking for additional items. The audio, other than the occasionally lame voice acting, is good, but on my 5.1 setup the PS4 version had a really rotten sound mix, with music primarily pumping out of the rear speakers and things like the \"shing\" of your sword slash, dialogue, and other combat-related audio quietly coming out of the center channel. For the record, this setup has been fine for plenty of other <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PS4</a> games, but I would have to make some major adjustments to individual channel volume to make this game sound anything close to correct.

Some of the items you'll find along the way include concept art and some unlockable challenges. Beacon Run is a checkpoint race against the clock that gives you a preset loadout of items for each challenge, to keep things fair. Survival mode is a combat challenge that sends you up against waves of bad guys and, again, keeps time for you. Those times are posted to online leaderboards along with your completion time for the campaign. I didn't find either of the two extra modes to be all that exciting, but it's nice that there's something other than the main chunk of action to play.</p><p style=\"\">I went in feeling really great about Strider. It opens abruptly and gets right down to business. The control feels good and the combat starts out in a pretty satisfying way. But, over time, those positives wear off. The game doesn't do enough with its additional items, areas, and action to make it feel like a steady challenge and the variety in the action is a little lacking. It's still a good time if you're the type of person who wants anything that resembles <a href=\"/metroid/3030-21761/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21761\">Metroid</a>, modern-day <a href=\"/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/3030-14216/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14216\">Castlevania</a>, or anything in-between.

The add-on is set years after the events of Black Flag, but does not remark on them, except for the occasional mention of the main game's protagonist, <a href=\"/edward-kenway/3005-25756/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25756\">Edward Kenway</a>. Adéwalé, now an active member of the Assassins brotherhood, intercepts a Templar package. It's unclear what's inside, but it's clearly important, so Adéwalé makes off into a deadly storm with it. Nature tears apart his ship, and he wakes up on the shores of <a href=\"/port-au-prince/3035-4661/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4661\">Port-au-Prince</a>. <a href=\"/slavery/3015-1779/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1779\">Slavery </a>was mentioned in Black Flag, but it's central to the economy in Port-au-Prince and the nearby islands. Adéwalé becomes involved in the brewing revolution, promising assistance before returning to the Assassins.</p><p style=\"\">Even though Black Flag represented a welcomed return to form for a series that was almost made irrelevant by its third major entry, there was so much to digest. I spent more than 30 hours as a pirate on the high seas, and it's easy to imagine how one could more than double that. So I wouldn't blame anyone for being tired of Black Flag by the credits, especially since Ubisoft is likely to deliver another <a href=\"/assassins-creed/3025-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-38\">Assassin's Creed</a> this year. In that regard, Freedom Cry doesn't do much to mix up the formula that's worked so well for the series since finding its footing with <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed-ii/3030-22928/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22928\">Assassins Creed II</a>. On-foot missions are still largely about frustratingly trying to eavesdrop on a group of characters who constantly look behind themselves for no good reason, killing a set of assigned targets, and generally stealthing around. Life at sea has not changed very much, either, but it remains damn fun.</p><p style=\"\">What has changed in Freedom Cry, however, is the context of your actions. The ongoing, mostly tired tug-of-war between the Assassins and Templars is merely window dressing in Freedom Cry, with Adéwalé's central motivation a desire to free his brothers from the shackles he once found himself in. There's a good reason games have largely steered away from the subject of slavery. It's harrowing, personal, and deeply emotional. Even though the Assassin's Creed series is one born of a fantastic premise, one cannot invoke the very real concept of slavery without strict scrutiny alongside it. And this is where Freedom Cry both soars and stumbles.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">I could never muster the desire for the optional objectives in Assassin's Creed. It's a feature for completionists, and seemed to encourage player behavior that highlighted the very worst parts of Assassin's Creed gameplay. But I often found myself trying to do everything in Freedom Cry. It's one thing to ask the player to try and air assassinate a target, and quite another to ask them to rescue a group of slaves on the compound you're exploring. This is a fictional experience, but that's a powerful string to tug at. As a player who often errs on the side of helping, it was hard for me to justify not making sure these types of objectives were completed. It not only made sense for the type of character I play as, it perfectly lined up with Adéwalé's deeply personal reasons for action in Freedom Cry. It's not that Freedom Cry completely reinvents the often boring objectives that drive missions in Assassin's Creed, but the contextual reframing gives them a powerful emotional component.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2603258-9970590247-Assas.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2603258\" style=\"width: 5760px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"5760\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2603258-9970590247-Assas.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2603258\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/9/93998/2603258-9970590247-Assas.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\"> <div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">But there are reasons to raise an eyebrow, as well. Rescuing slaves is one of the key gameplay additions in Freedom Cry, and you're constantly reminded of ways you can help. A slave may be trying to escape from their captor, and you can stop the chase. Another group of slaves may be in the process of being sold, and you can step in, buy them, and set them free. Some of them may join the fomenting revolution in Port-au-prince, while others are simply allowed to live their lives. This makes sense, and from the perspective of designing a fulfilling open world, this gives the player regular, meaningful actions to participate in while getting to the next mission. What's questionable is Ubisoft's decision to turn the slaves into a form of in-game currency, a cruelly ironic twist. The more slaves the player frees, the more upgrades available from vendors that support Adéwalé. This generates a horrific disconnect from the very human tragedy the upgrade system pulls from. It's an especially gross feeling to be running around a town square, waiting for slaves to spawn on the map because you're only a few away from unlocking that really sweet machete. (This actually happened.) It's mostly unnecessary, too, as players accrue most of the upgrades simply by engaging with the required mission objectives. That includes rescuing slave ships, which can house nearly 100 captives at once. There's already an in-game currency the player uses to buy stuff, so while it's understandable Ubisoft designers wanted to reward players for engaging in side objectives, it only undermines the seriousness with which the game otherwise treats the subject.</p><p style=\"\">And there are genuine moments of emotional heartbreak where all of these concerns, for the moment, fade away. An especially trying moment involves Adéwalé defying the recommendations of his fellow revolutionaries, and attempts to free a nearby slave ship. It all goes horribly, horribly wrong, and puts the venomous, inhuman contempt of Port-au-Prince's cruel rulers on full display. When you can't save everyone, who do you save? It's a moment in which Freedom Cry poignantly layers the draw of a spectacle that is only possible in a big-budget video game with the subtlety we have come to expect from our best independent productions. One section involves Adéwalé climbing up a wall, the same way a character in Assassin's Creed often does, but what surrounds you is...unforgettable. When the mission was over, I had to set the controller down. I was drained, and Adéwalé's pain was my own. We were both equally seeking blood and revenge.</p><p style=\"\">Freedom Cry is about hope. It's about hope for a people, even if it feels futile and fleeting. You don't solve the problem of slavery in Freedom Cry. The way slaves and plantation owners constantly cycle back into the world, no matter how many you liberate, also works as genuine commentary on the state of slavery at the time. It might just be a way the game keeps the world from becoming empty...but it works. The add-on also gives hope for what's possible when blockbuster-driven creators take risks with material. There are missteps in Freedom Cry, more ethical than mechanical, but it hits as often as it misses. That's undeniably an important step forward.</p>", "deck": "It's easy to imagine a big-budget game tackling slavery with the subtlety of a hammer, but Freedom Cry is an emotional triumph...with some ethical issues.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-626/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-45343/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed-freedom-cry/3030-45343/", "id": 45343, "name": "Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-02-20 13:06:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-132854/", "id": 132854, "name": "Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/thief-review/1900-627/", "description": "<p style=\"\">A good stealth game makes you feel like a silent badass. A bad one makes you feel like an idiot stumbling around in the dark. It is with much regret that I inform you that <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/thief/3030-26400/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26400\">Thief</a>, <a href=\"/eidos-montreal/3010-6462/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6462\">Eidos-Montreal</a>'s update of <a href=\"/looking-glass-studios-inc/3010-2858/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2858\">Looking Glass Studios</a>' classic stealth franchise, leans more toward the latter. As master thief <a href=\"/garrett/3005-908/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-908\">Garrett</a>, you spend hours sneaking around a dank city, plucking coin and other valuables from every available drawer, pocket, and hidden safe you can find. This is the part Thief gets right, which makes the many aspects that it gets wrong all the more bewildering. Instead of focusing on Garrett's chosen profession, Thief spirals into yet another story of apocalyptic mysticism and grand conspiracy, and often does so at the expense of the game's best aspects. Moments of true thievery are frequently left to side missions, which leaves roughly 10 hours of story in which you navigate bland mazes of narrow corridors, dull traps, and dimwitted A.I. foes, all for an end result that does nothing but underscore what a colossal waste of time the whole endeavor ultimately was.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2591839-024083.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591839\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2591839-024083.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591839\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9493/2591839-024083.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Before Garrett becomes wrapped up in all this world-ending nonsense, he is The City's number one thief. Whether rich or poor, Garrett steals from anyone who happens to have something he might want, and he's managed to avoid jail and death primarily through his deeply rooted sense of self-interest. One fateful night, Garrett and his protege--a young woman named Erin--stumble upon The City's generically vile Baron conjuring up an ancient power. Garrett, sensing this is a situation he can't properly handle, tries to escape, but Erin plunges ahead and ends up crashing through the ceiling into the middle of this bizarre ritual. A lot of blue lights and smoke effects consume the screen, and suddenly... nothing. Garrett awakes on a cart full of dead bodies, only to discover he's been asleep for the better part of a year. With no idea what's happened, Garrett sets about uncovering the mystery of the ritual, Erin's fate, and the terrible disease that's gripped the whole of the city in his absence.</p><p style=\"\">Where that plot goes is extraordinary only in its mundanity. It sounds like an unfair dismissal to just say nothing interesting happens in Thief, but as I sit here, racking my brains to try and come up with one element of the story that stood out in the slightest, I just can't. Thief plods along at a pace that ranges from slow to excruciatingly sluggish, and at no point does it ever deliver a new character or situation worth caring about. The characters are acted well enough in most cases, but Garrett often sounds barely interested in what they have to say, and the script never fleshes out any of them sufficiently enough to grab your attention. This makes moments of presumed satisfaction--such as the culmination of Garrett's barely formed rivalry with the city's top corrupt cop, or the sudden reveal of a bad guy's true motives toward the end of the game--fall completely flat.</p><p style=\"\">It doesn't help that Thief's story missions often seem only mildly interested in Garrett's role as a thief. Sure, the entire game is built with stealthy environmental traversal in mind, but few story missions require you to do much actual thieving. There's certainly loot to be found in each chapter, and collecting it allows you more funds to use to purchase upgrades for Garrett. But all that stuff is optional. In most missions, you're tasked with hunting for clues that tie in to the game's overarching mystery, one that becomes less and less interesting as it goes along.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">This is Thief's greatest folly. It gives you this character with all these nifty abilities that should make him a great thief, then spends the entirety of its storyline making him investigate a supernatural mystery of no particular interest. Instead, it relegates much of the thievery to scattered loot and side missions. In these side missions, you'll have the opportunity to earn quite a bit of coin doing jobs for various unscrupulous types, stealing all sorts of different goods. These missions aren't often terribly involved, but they make the best use of Garrett's abilities, and there are quite a lot of them. Whether you're sneaking into an apartment to grab a valuable painting, or tailing a drunk through the streets to find where he's hiding stolen goods, these are the moments that best line up with what a game called Thief ought to be. It's just a shame that these missions are so far out of the way from the main story, where the act of thievery feels mostly incidental to the larger, less interesting mystery.</p><p style=\"\">But that's Thief in a nutshell, a game that spends an inordinate amount of time making the player do uninteresting things while shoving the more fun stuff so far in the corner you'd be forgiven for missing most of it. Its mechanics feel best suited for gameplay scenarios the main story doesn't often care much about. Sure, whether it's in the story or on a side venture, you'll have to play a similar kind of stealth in order to avoid spooking guards and progress through the stage. But the sense of reward for that careful sneaking feels loads more satisfying when you're just nicking trinkets and valuables, versus the slog of trudging through the awful plot.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2591843-024087.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591843\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2591843-024087.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591843\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9493/2591843-024087.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">In a best-case scenario, you'll spend much of Thief cloaked in the shadows, avoiding bad guys rather than directly engaging them. In some cases this works well, especially if you take the time to learn the environments and discover their many available hiding places. (I say \"if\" as if there's much choice in the matter, but in truth you'll have no choice but to learn the environments through repeated trial-and-error.) In a worst-case scenario, you'll find yourself often surrounded by four or five bad guys because you somehow alerted a guard without realizing it. This is not a game in which combat is recommended whatsoever. If you can sneak up behind a guy and take him down unawares, then great. But head-on fights involve you swinging your trusty cudgel over and over again while trying to time dodges against enemy swipes and shots. Every fight is essentially the same dodge-and-swipe situation, and if you've got more than a few guys surrounding you, you're usually screwed. Unless they suddenly get stuck running up against a piece of the environment, or inexplicably just stop and stare at you from a few feet away, that is.</p><p style=\"\">Again, taking enemies head-on is very much <em>not</em> the point of the game, but it's rare that Thief allows you enough leeway to truly avoid all confrontations. Every environment feels cramped and tight, which means you frequently have to walk within inches of bad guys just to get to the next area. Sometimes it's easy enough to predict what will alert an enemy to your presence, but other times it just comes out of nowhere. This means it's often best just to wait until you can get a guy alone, sneak up, and whack them from behind. You do this again and again and again until you get to the next checkpoint, which makes the game sometimes feel a bit like an especially sneaky rendition of whack-a-mole. You can cause distractions by tossing objects, or by using one of the many different arrows Garrett comes equipped with. Sometimes these are effective in sending guards off in the opposite direction, and sometimes it just causes them to all freak out and start running around every which way. Most often, your best bet is just using water arrows to snuff out fires while skulking around in the dark, hoping you don't happen upon anyone you won't be able to avoid fighting.</p><p style=\"\">This combat stuff would mean less if the environments were better-designed, but navigating Thief's world is rarely very exciting. Using Garrett's \"swoop\" ability to dash from one dark corner to another is a delight, but many of his other movements are saddled to an all-purpose action button. Garrett can't even jump freely, which forces you to find ledges and corners that will trigger his various leaping animations. Finding those isn't terribly difficult, mind you. Garrett's brush with mystical forces gives him a \"focus\" ability that highlights all the different traps, climb points, and other areas of interest within his field of view. In general, the only real challenge to traversing the world is how easy it is to get turned around and suddenly find yourself at a dead-end. With this added ability, it becomes super easy to just figure out where to go in most situations. On the one hand, this relieves frustration you may feel with the game's map, which borders on useless. On the other, the only real challenge then comes from finding ways to avoid fights. Those looking for a tougher challenge will find it if they skip out on using the focus ability and ramp up the difficulty level. Playing on the higher levels imposes some tough restrictions on attacking foes, which in turn makes careful play all the more vital. Plotting an ideal path through a bunch of clueless enemies can certainly be satisfying, but even in more challenging situations, the path to success is rarely that hard to uncover.</p><p style=\"\">More disappointing is how bland and cramped every environment feels. Thief flirts with the idea of an open world outside of its story chapters, but in reality, The City is just a series of small open sections bookended by load times. When you first exit Garrett's hideout and enter The City, only minutes go by before you come upon your first door or window that leads to another load time. It's surprising just how often these pop up, and it sucks nearly all the fun out of exploring The City. That's unfortunate, since exploring The City is exactly what you'll have to do in order to take part in those side missions. If there's any positive here, it's that you can often use these load times to your advantage when being chased by enemies. Once you hit one of those new area access points, all you have to do is press a button and suddenly you're out of the fire.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2591841-024085.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591841\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2591841-024085.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2591841\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9493/2591841-024085.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9493/2591841-024085.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Thief's small environments might be more forgivable if the game were some kind of visual powerhouse, which it most certainly is not. Character and environment art are caked in a steampunk-lite industrial vibe, but without any unique flavor or style to call its own. It's all very drab, which perhaps fits with the game's gloomy atmosphere, but doesn't lend itself toward being especially memorable. In fact, all I really remember about Thief's visuals is how bad nearly all the animation looks, especially in any combat situation. Arms flail about until either you reach a quicktime event pops up to let you K.O. them, or they run out of health and fall over in an animation that looks like a bad placeholder. The game does at least run reasonably well on PC, though I kept running into a bizarre array of audio glitches throughout my playtime. Key dialogue would somehow get mixed down to the point of being inaudible against background sounds, or sound effects would sometimes drop out altogether. And then there were the random crashes, which popped up at least a half-dozen times over the course of my playthrough.</p><p style=\"\">Above all else, Thief's greatest crime is one of boredom. Too much of its gameplay is bereft of excitement or satisfaction. Instead of feeling like a master thief, you mostly spend the game feeling like a generic first-person action hero who just happens to be especially bad at fighting people. Sneaking around Thief's world is intermittently interesting, especially when the game puts its focus squarely on the act of stealing, but even those moments are frequently brought down by the game's various rough edges. You have to work very hard to find the fun bits of Thief, and more often than not, the payoff just isn't worth the effort.</p>", "deck": "Thief offers up moments of stealthy satisfaction, but not nearly enough of them to make up for its many rough edges, bland level designs, and god-awful plot.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-627/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26400/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/thief/3030-26400/", "id": 26400, "name": "Thief"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2014-02-24 14:42:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-125787/", "id": 125787, "name": "Thief"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-review/1900-629/", "description": "<p style=\"\">You'd think that over the course of its 17-year history, at least one of the several video games based on <em>South Park</em> would have been good.

Sewers become dungeons, the school becomes a warzone, and the entire nation of <a href=\"/canada/3035-244/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-244\">Canada</a> morphs into a 16-bit RPG overworld, complete with its own random creature encounters and convoluted quests.</p><p style=\"\">This game of high fantasy war between foul-mouthed fourth graders might be enough to sustain a game on its own, but that's really only a portion of the story. Alien abductions, government cover-ups, and a mysterious goo that turns everyone into Nazi zombies all show up not even a few hours into the plot. Surprisingly, this doesn't result in a game that feels scattered or unfocused. If anything, The Stick of Truth is remarkably consistent, and well-edited. Few moments ever drag on longer than they should, with jokes and battles often lasting just long enough to leave an impression before the game moves on to the next bit. If you take the time to explore and do its many side quests, the game probably runs between 12-13 hours. That might sound short for an RPG, but it packs a great deal of material into those hours, and almost all of it is very funny.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">If it isn't, then there's a good chance that it's at least super gross and potentially offensive to somebody. You've probably already heard about some of the more intense bits of The Stick of Truth, such as the abortion clinic section and the anal probing sequence <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2014/02/25/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-censored-in-a-whole-lot-of-the-wo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">that have both been edited in certain regions</a>. It's probably enough to say that, yeah, some of that stuff is more outlandish than it is actually funny, and will probably be a little much for some people's tastes. But I'd hazard to guess that few of those people would call themselves big fans of <em>South Park</em>'s general sense of humor, and that's really who The Stick of Truth is aimed toward, anyway.</p><p style=\"\">If that's you, then you're going to find a lot to like about The Stick of Truth. The game is packed with major and minor characters from the TV series, loads of hidden references, and just an insane number of collectible objects, most of which just exist to remind you of an episode of the show. The town features dozens of businesses, homes, and other hidden areas to explore, and seemingly every room has at least one hidden joke or reference to find. The map itself isn't huge, but it's easily navigable, is quick to load, and has a fast-travel system that takes any needless traversal out of the equation. I was surprised how much time I dropped just wandering around the town, looking for whatever secret things I could find. It didn't matter if all that exploring led to a side quest featuring sentient poo creature Mr. Hanky, or just one of 30 collectible \"Chinpokomon\" toys. It all felt worth finding.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495882-south-park-the-stick-of-truth_2013_06-10-13_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495882\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495882-south-park-the-stick-of-truth_2013_06-10-13_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495882\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495882-south-park-the-stick-of-truth_2013_06-10-13_003.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Stick of Truth's battle system is surprisingly deep, yet easy to learn. I just wish the fart mechanics were a bit better. No, I never thought I'd ever have to write that sentence either.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In addition to jokes and random junk, you'll also collect a ton of different gear, weaponry, and costuming as you play. So much, in fact, that you may never even get around to using it all. Again, The Stick of Truth tries to pack a whole lot into a relatively short game. This isn't the sort of game where you'll want to get too attached to any one item, because odds are something better is almost always hiding right around the corner. If anything, it's just impressive how many different things the game offers you for character customization. The initial character creator has a decent amount of variety on its own, and as you progress through the game, you'll find tons of different armor sets, weapons, wigs, glasses, and facial features to play around with. Incidentally, it's worth noting that The Stick of Truth only lets you create a male character. I'd guess that has to do with the fact that on the show, the boys usually only play together, and the girls are treated more or less as their own, entirely separate faction within the context of the game. Maybe that narrative justification makes the exclusion of a creatable girl character less of an issue for you, or maybe it doesn't. I just thought it was worth pointing out.</p><p style=\"\">The most impressive thing about all the character customization stuff is how crazy deep it goes. Some changes are just cosmetic, but every piece of armor and weaponry comes with its own set of ability bonuses and level restrictions. Every piece of equipment can be patched with additional abilities, which you'll acquire throughout the world or earn during battle. Plus, you have upgradable traits that are inherent to your character class. The available classes include a fighter, a mage, a thief, and a Jew. The Jew is essentially a traditional cleric class, but with far more references to Judaism attached to every attack. To preemptively answer your question, no, there's nothing particularly offensive about the Jew class. It doesn't go for cheap racial stereotypes, and mostly keeps its related gags lighthearted and fun.</p><p style=\"\">Each class comes with its own set of attacks and abilities, but regardless as to which you choose, battles tend to play out with similar strategies. Though the battle system is essentially a traditional turn-based one, it's been streamlined to make it immediately accessible regardless as to your experience level with this genre. Experienced RPG players can experiment with several different attack buffs (which include fire, ice, electricity, and \"gross out\"), party members (which include the main four boys, as well as Butters and Jimmy), class abilities, and earnable perks throughout the game. Granted, it's debatable as to whether you really need all those systems, since battles are rarely drawn-out affairs, and the game's difficulty level is best described as \"extremely manageable.\" Even if you've never played a game like this before, the basic attack mechanics are dirt-simple to learn, and usually only require a decent sense of timing to be successful. Still, even if it's not <em>necessary</em> to have all this stuff in battle, that doesn't make playing around with it any less fun.</p><p style=\"\">The only part of The Stick of Truth I had any trouble getting the hang of was the game's assorted fart magics. Yes, your character is something of a savant when it comes to manipulating the gasses that emanate from your ass. Each spell has its own particular use: the \"dragon shout\" fart is a good all-purpose fart blast, while the \"Nagasaki\" fart comes in handy for demolishing highlighted pieces of the scenery. You perform spells by holding down on the right stick of your controller and using the left stick to find the right \"frequency\" for the spell. It works, but it's a bit unwieldy at first, especially for a mechanic that essentially boils down to an elaborate fart joke. Ultimately, unless a puzzle specifically called for it, I mostly just avoided using the fart spells altogether. Depending on how you feel about the inherent hilariousness of farting, you may have more fun with them than I did.</p><p style=\"\">The difficulty might skew toward newer players, but battles remain engaging regardless of the challenge level. It helps that there's a ton of variety when it comes to enemy encounters. Some generic bad guys appear in the main world, but nearly every mission battle comes with its own array of enemies, each with their own unique attacks and related gags. Some of the best jokes in the game come during battle sequences, especially when you start trying out the unique summons you can earn through various side quests. These are battle-ending attacks featuring key side characters from the show, which include Jesus and Mr. Slave, among others. Essentially, whatever The Stick of Truth might lack in straight-up difficulty, it more than makes up for with variety and humor.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2273905-008843.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2273905\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56189047261815\" data-width=\"1333\" style=\"width: 1333px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2273905-008843.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2273905\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9493/2273905-008843.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9493/2273905-008843.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It probably didn't need to take 17 years, but at least now we have an actually great South Park game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you still need more convincing that The Stick of Truth does the <em>South Park</em> license proud, maybe consider that it looks and sounds exactly like the show. And not just during cutscenes, either. Whether you're in battle or just wandering around the town, everything looks like it came straight from the TV series. The purposely crappy animation style of the show is perfectly captured in every sequence, and every significant character is fully voiced by Parker, Stone, and the other actors from the series. It feels like you're interacting with the world as you've seen it on TV, versus the kinds of tech-limited representations we've grown accustomed to enduring in most licensed games. And it runs great too, or at least does so on the PC. It's worth noting that I never got to try the console versions of The Stick of Truth, but the PC version ran nearly issue free during my time with it. One random crash bug and a single instance of the game's soundtrack cutting out during a battle were all I ever noticed. Beyond that, load times were quick, checkpoints were aplenty, and I managed to get through the campaign free of types of issues we (perhaps rightfully) tend to associate with Obsidian's games.</p><p style=\"\">I don't know what else I can even say about The Stick of Truth without just spoiling the jokes for people, so let's just call it right here. The Stick of Truth is the best <em>South Park</em> game by a country mile, but even removed from the franchise's dismal history with video games, it's also just one of the funniest games I've ever played. It pays tribute to the series' long history of memorably offensive jokes while also delivering an original story hilarious enough to stand on its own. Even more importantly, its gameplay is in no way an encumbrance to your enjoyment. Obsidian has fashioned an honest-to-god RPG out of the <em>South Park</em> universe, one with enough depth and longevity to hold your interest even when the comedy takes a breather. If the fantastically foul world of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny still holds any appeal to you, The Stick of Truth is a game well worth your time.</p>", "deck": "The Stick of Truth is one of the rare instances of a licensed game done exactly right.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-629/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36978/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/south-park-the-stick-of-truth/3030-36978/", "id": 36978, "name": "South Park: The Stick of Truth"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2014-03-04 00:01:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115400/", "id": 115400, "name": "South Park: The Stick of Truth"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/titanfall-review/1900-630/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"/titanfall/3030-42860/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42860\">Titanfall</a> is a game for people who like competitive first-person shooters, but have gotten tired of seeing the same basic action year in and year out. If you already don't like (or have, at some point in the past, liked) games like <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a>, there's a very good chance that Titanfall will hold zero appeal for you. It is not here to save you, it is not rewriting the book on competitive action games, it will not wash your car, tuck you in at night, or fix you chicken soup if you get the flu. Titanfall doesn't have time for that nonsense; it's way too focused on being a great multiplayer shooter for people who already enjoy them. That leads to an interesting conundrum and a package that manages to be laser-focused on a specific type of gameplay, which can make it also feel a little too small. It all comes down to how much you already enjoy these games and how badly you want something that updates the Call of Duty formula in some new, exciting ways.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2607889-tf_fracture_battle_0+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2607889\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2607889-tf_fracture_battle_0+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2607889\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2607889-tf_fracture_battle_0+%281%29.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The AI-controlled grunts are really good at standing around and being ineffectual.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This game is \"multiplayer-only,\" meaning you can't even get into the game's brief training mode without first connecting to an online server. It has a campaign mode, but this is really just a set of standard multiplayer matches with some assorted story-focused dialogue layered over the action, like someone decided to put on a radio play while you shoot at people. It doesn't have very many modes to its competitive multiplayer either--there are five, to be exact, and two of them are identical in basic gameplay but slightly different in the way points are scored. By having equivalents to Call of Duty's <a href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\">Team Deathmatch</a> and <a href=\"/conquest-mode/3015-1099/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1099\">Domination</a> modes, Titanfall checks the most popular boxes, but when you compare it to the three-games-in-one-for-the-same-price approach of Call of Duty, Titanfall feels small. This is probably the point where I should remind you that both games launched at full price.</p><p style=\"\">That all sounds pretty damning, and if you're a value-minded consumer who wants tons of variety out of a game, Titanfall is a tough sell. But behind the short list of modes and no-stakes storytelling lies some extremely satisfying and fluid gameplay. Titanfall looks slim on paper, but in practice it's positively explosive for a couple of different reasons. First, you have more mobility as a player. The soldiers in Titanfall can double jump and run along walls, and you can combine those moves again and again to get up onto rooftops and climb high walls. The verticality of the action means that there could be an enemy pilot hiding just about anywhere, and you're forced to adapt and start looking around everywhere, instead of just keeping your eyes focused at ground level and the obvious perches that make up most shooter maps these days. Moving around in Titanfall is rewarding and fun, at times feeling like you're playing a light version of Mirror's Edge, but never so much that it forgets that your primary mission is to shoot people.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495225-tf_angelcity_pilot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495225\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495225-tf_angelcity_pilot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495225\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2840/2495225-tf_angelcity_pilot.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Wall-running and a big robot. This image sums up Titanfall's unique features pretty perfectly.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The movement creates amazing scenarios that you want to tell people about, like the time you ran along a wall to clamber up to a rooftop only to leap off of that roof into a window across the street, where you caught some unsuspecting fool slipping and kicked him in his stupid face... and then you just kept running, trying to do it all again. Or the time you hauled ass around the outer edge of the map, shot every single AI soldier you saw, snapped a couple of necks, captured a control point, and immediately made a giant robot drop out of the sky. Camping out on a roof or in a window is certainly possible in Titanfall, and the game has sniper rifles in an attempt to support this type of gameplay, but players move so quickly and erratically that snipers feel like they're at a real disadvantage... which further incites more players to run around like maniacs at all times. In 20 or so hours with the game I've had a sizable list of great-looking moments where the mobility and shooting collide in a way that makes you feel unstoppable. It's a game that feels like it was built for highlight reels.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The other big differentiators are the titans themselves. These big robot suits drop from the sky in impressive fashion when pilots call them in, and they let you stomp and dash around levels with some amount of authority. But they aren't invincible. The shields on a titan recharge, Halo-style, but the underlying armor does not. This, along with lengthy weapon reload animations, incentivize you to occasionally back off and recharge. The titans are actually somewhat fragile, so you don't necessarily need to fight titans with titans, as every player has a dedicated slot for anti-titan weapons that can do serious damage. The interplay between players on foot and players in their robots is great, with pilots attempting to poke out, paint a titan long enough to lock-on, and fire big missiles before getting noticed, gunned-down, stomped, or punched apart by a giant robot fist. That said, I found titan-on-titan conflicts to be somewhat monotonous and occasionally even sluggish, since it's the only time the game asks you to hang back and prepare instead of going full-bore at the competition. But hey, let the titans blow up... you can always get another one.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2607888-titanfall_ftf_1920x1080_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2607888\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2607888-titanfall_ftf_1920x1080_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2607888\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2607888-titanfall_ftf_1920x1080_0.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2840/2607888-titanfall_ftf_1920x1080_0.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can enter your titan from any angle, resulting in a handful of nice boarding animations.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Titan deployment is governed by a timer. That timer ticks down naturally, but you can also reduce the required time by shooting enemies. Killing players and shooting at titans take significant chunks off your clock, but the maps are also peppered with AI foes who aren't smart or strong enough to kill you unless you're extremely careless. They keep you on your toes and, yes, killing them also takes time off your titan clock, giving you a decent incentive to farm those AI enemies as you run from place to place. You might think of it as the Call of Duty killstreak system, but instead of only rewarding players who play well, it rewards everyone--but players who shoot well are rewarded much more frequently.</p><p style=\"\">Like just about every other modern shooter, Titanfall has you earning experience points, gaining levels, and unlocking different customization options. You'll quickly gain the ability to create custom loadouts for both your pilot and your titan, and each has its own set of weapons and perks. As is my custom, I settled on fully automatic assault rifles as the main weapon for both my pilot and titan. The game has a short list of other weapons, but range-reduced sub-machine guns and shotguns feel too limited when faced with the larger-than-average map sizes. For players who especially like getting behind enemies or can't aim, the one unique option for primary pilot weapons is a smart pistol that behaves like lock-on targeting in a <a href=\"/panzer-dragoon/3025-461/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-461\">Panzer Dragoon</a> game. AI-powered fodder goes down in one lock-on hit, but human pilots won't drop unless you lock onto them with three separate shots. Is it unbalanced? A baby gun for <em>babies</em>? I'm no balance designer, but the smart pistol doesn't feel all that powerful. Locking on three times takes longer than it would take to just aim at and shoot an enemy with any other weapon, and If you stand around long enough to get locked onto three times, you probably deserve to get gunned down.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2608527-titanfall+screen+4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608527\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2608527-titanfall+screen+4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608527\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2608527-titanfall+screen+4.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2608527-titanfall+screen+4.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The auto-eject perk lets you launch out of your titan before it blows up, taking you with it.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Titans have more options in addition to basic full-auto and semi-auto rifles, like a quad rocket launcher, a railgun, a charged energy bolt, and a grenade launcher that fires three grenades at once. The titan loadouts seem more interesting than the pilot weapons because they can help you play slightly different roles. The assault rifle and lighter weapons are fast-firing and handy against pesky pilots and still useful in titan-on-titan skirmishes. The heavier weapons, as you might expect, take a little longer to get going, but they're much more devastating to a titan's armor. Overall, most of the weapon options feel a little staid. You might expect a world that allows humans to warp to faraway planets and call in robots from space to offer up slightly edgier weapons than SMGs and sniper rifles.</p><p style=\"\">The online-only nature of Titanfall means that it's only as good as its server infrastructure. In pre-release testing, I ran into a few cases where the latency would spike, causing AI opposition to seize up and enemy titans to halt, mid-dash. On launch day, the game ran into some bumps, occasionally dropping players from games or lobbies, making it difficult to get into a game at times. This seems like it was mostly smoothed over by the end of its first 24 hours on sale, and the network responsiveness has been solid, with none of the lag spikes or other issues I saw prior to the game's launch. It's a little disappointing that the game doesn't have an option for private matches or any sort of LAN support, but what's on display seems to work well.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2608540-titanfall+screen+2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608540\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2608540-titanfall+screen+2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608540\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2608540-titanfall+screen+2.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2608540-titanfall+screen+2.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The titans can dash out of the way of some missiles.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The frame rate in Titanfall is uneven on the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> and though it's usually fine, it can get downright nasty in specific situations. In one Last Titan Standing match--where every player spawns in a robot suit--several players crammed their mechs into a tight area and began duking it out, and the frame rate dived down to what must have been single digits per second. Even out in wider areas, the game feels a little hitchy from time to time, and there's noticeable tearing throughout. The visuals in Titanfall look nice, but that's mostly due to some solid art and interesting design, not the performance. On the PC, the game scales to fit a lot of different configurations, so you can essentially buy your way out of the console version's performance issues. On a proper machine, the textures look great and the smooth frame rate really goes a long way.</p><p style=\"\">I'll say it again, since we should probably wrap this up: Titanfall is a very specific game built for a specific type of person. When you add it all up, the list of available content and the various options for speccing out your pilot feel light, and that might make this game a little hard to swallow at $60. But getting into these wild situations and shooting your way out of them feels fresh and fun in a way that the other shooters on the market don't. If you like the basic form but need more of a twist on how you move and how you shoot, Titanfall's core action is extremely satisfying, which makes it a little easier to overlook the lack of available modes.</p><p style=\"\"><em>Editor's note 03/13/2014: Due to this game's online-only requirement, this review originally went up without a score on it.

To most people, that sounds like yet another predictable entry in the <em>Saw</em> movies. But it's also part of \"escape the room,\" a surprisingly lively subgenre of games familiar to players of the visual novels <a href=\"/999-9-hours-9-persons-9-doors/3030-27266/\" data-ref-id=\"999-9\">999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</a>, <a href=\"/zero-escape-virtues-last-reward/3030-36237/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36237\">Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward</a>, and others. <a href=\"/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/3030-33341/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33341\">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a> even comes from <a href=\"/spike-chunsoft/3010-8152/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8152\">Spike Chunsoft</a>, the same developer of both 999 and VLR. This game happily follows in the genre's footsteps--sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. If you're looking for a narrative-driven experience unlike just about anything else out there, Danganronpa delivers handsomely and weirdly.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2608810-5280637840-PS_Vi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608810\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2608810-5280637840-PS_Vi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608810\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2608810-5280637840-PS_Vi.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Besides you, every character in Danganronpa is one hell of an eccentric, but they're all reasonably fleshed out.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Danganronpa takes place in <a href=\"/hopes-peak-academy/3035-4240/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4240\">Hope's Peak Academy</a>, an elite school for elite students. Only a select few are admitted every school year, and each must be the best of the best. In Danganronpa's world, these pupils are deemed ultimates. <a href=\"/sayaka-maizono/3005-25030/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25030\">Sayaka Maizono</a>, for example, is the \"Ultimate Pop Sensation,\" <a href=\"/leon-kuwata/3005-25031/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25031\">Leon Kuwata</a> is the \"Ultimate Baseball Star,\" and <a href=\"/chihiro-fujisaki/3005-25034/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25034\">Chihiro Fujisaki</a> is the \"Ultimate Programmer.\" Players are cast as <a href=\"/makoto-naegi/3005-25024/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25024\">Makoto Naegi</a>, a humble but affable youngster who is, at first glance, unexceptional in every way. He's the \"Ultimate Lucky Student,\" as he's been granted the opportunity to attend Hope's Peak Academy, despite his lack of special skills. As each student arrives at the school, they pass out. Upon awakening, the students introduce themselves to one another before meeting the master of ceremonies, <a href=\"/monokuma/3005-25028/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25028\">Monokuma</a>. He's a, uh, talking and murdering bear. (That's not really anymore ridiculous than the talking doll from <em>Saw</em>, to be fair.) The group has the option of living out the rest of their lives in the school, or \"graduating\" by killing one another. If you can get away with murder, you can leave.</p><p style=\"\">From there, when you're not tapping through dialogue, the game transitions to a relationship simulator of sorts. Looking around unlocks tokens to buy presents from the school's store. These presents, if used appropriately, can advance your relationship with the other students. (But not in a sexual manner, from what I saw.) Sadly, with some rare exceptions, you don't learn much from these moments that wouldn't arrive via the main storyline. It's mostly a means to unlock new abilities for the courtroom portion of the game and gathering trophies. The lack of meaningful insight into the characters meant I'd often find myself picking which one to spend time with at random, simply hoping to advance the storyline to the next major beat. There is no real upside or downside to who you spend time with, as the story does not adjust based on your choices, and the abilities aren't necessary to complete the courtroom segments. It's a missed opportunity for a game that is, largely, all about its story.</p><p style=\"\">The main storyline does spend plenty of time with the characters, though. And while Danganronpa has moments of shocking violence, unlike your typical horror, it's not entirely about the gore. In fact, Danganronpa even swaps the color of blood from red to pink. What makes Danganronpa different is context. The many quiet moments with each character give each death a sense of weight and loss, and while you should never grow attached, you will. Learning about <a href=\"/byakuya-togami/3005-25039/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25039\">Byakuya</a>'s ambitions for greatness as a means of living up to to his family lineage or <a href=\"/hinako-kujou/3005-22310/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22310\">Hina</a>'s secret desire for donuts in moments of weakness means each chapter and each death is not just a bodycount. Many of the characters are purposely unlikable, but their intentions are, often, logically justifiable and create a wild, unpredictable dynamic that unfolds over the game's 20ish hours.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">As one might expect, it doesn't take long for things to go awry. Not everyone is content to stay inside for the rest of their lives, and murder(s) come quickly. When a body is discovered, the game transitions to an <a href=\"/ace-attorney/3025-907/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-907\">Ace Attorney</a>-style investigation mode. Searching the world around you is easy enough, as tapping triangle brings up all the interactive parts of the environment. You can't really fail, as the game's story won't move forward until you have all the evidence that's available, which are stored in your inventory as \"truth bullets.\" (As silly as this sounds--and it's definitely silly--the game's title is derived from the Japanese words for bullet and refutation.)</p><p style=\"\">After you've clicked on everything, Monokuma will ask everyone to head to the school's basement, which happens to house a circular courtroom. (It has a bath house, so why not?) These hour-long unravelings of each murder(s) is where the meat of Danganronpa's gameplay takes place, and happen via a series of logic-based minigames. The most common one involves listening to a conversation between several different characters and pointing out a contradiction with either a piece of evidence from the crime scene or within the dialogue itself. These are the most fun, working as little riddles to tease out a new strand of truth. Every once and a while, there's a shooting gallery of letters used to play a game of Hangman, and when you're trying to completely break an argument, a quick rhythm game appears. Neither are very fun. However, every case closes with you arranging an elaborate comic outlining the murder from start to finish, which are easily the game's most enjoyable puzzles. A dozen more of these instead of a single game of Hangman would have been great.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2608811-2429779454-2013-.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608811\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2608811-2429779454-2013-.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608811\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/9/93998/2608811-2429779454-2013-.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The boring Hangman sections of Danganronpa are, thankfully, over almost as soon as they begin.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">I found it hard not to scratch my head during the courtroom sequences, too. Danganronpa desperately wants to make its story interactive, and does so with a false sense of drama. The game trips over itself so your character is the one to solve everything, even if others have already figured it out and have zero motivation to keep it from you. Plus, for whatever reason, you have a health bar? Point out a contradiction that doesn't work or mess up the rhythm game too many times and, for whatever reason, you're dead. Logic be damned! Even if the whole case has been leading towards another killer, the game needs a game over screen, so it employs a contrived reason to generate one that doesn't have a ring of truth to the story. Besides setting up the game's trophies for solving cases without a single mistake and fulfilling a design desire for the player to somehow \"lose,\" this does nothing but fuel a story twisting itself in knots to make sure the player has something to do.</p><p style=\"\">But for a game that opens with a seemingly ridiculous premise, it finishes remarkably well. The ending is delightfully and daringly ambiguous, and most games wouldn't show this much restraint. Now, sure, if I were to tell you the game's ending, you might laugh. I wouldn't blame you. It sounds pretty goofy! But it works incredibly well within the world Danganopra sets up, and, hey, almost any game ending sounds goofy out of context.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2608812-4289803498-PS_Vi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608812\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2608812-4289803498-PS_Vi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2608812\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2608812-4289803498-PS_Vi.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2608812-4289803498-PS_Vi.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bears are dangerous. Who would put a bear in charge of a school? True horror.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">For a game about subverting expectations, though, Danganropa is not one without its creepy moments. This is a game that has a character, Hifumi Yamada, meant to lampoon the unfair stereotype of an anime fan. He's fat, sweaty, and obsessed with 2D. It's really well written, and means Danganropa is acutely aware of its own genre tropes, both in and outside of the game. Despite this, it can't kick all of them. There is zero reason for one of the game's women to be shown in a provocative, seductive position on her bed, with her underwear fully on display...but it's there. Call it fanservice, call it whatever you want. It adds nothing to the game, and it's not part of a romantic relationship arc. Another scene involves the player being able to spy on the women in a bath house. It's only viewable if the player has a particular item from the school store, however, and is not presented as a \"choice\" for the player. It's unnecessary, the kind of thing where you have to hide your Vita in the middle of a bus ride, hoping you don't have to explain you're not looking at porn. Games are a medium that shouldn't shy away from sex and romance, but doing so requires a maturity not found here, and nothing in the story suggests these were needed.</p><p style=\"\">(Another moment that should be mentioned<strong> is also a spoiler</strong>, so feel free to skip this paragraph, if you'd like. One character, whom I won't mention, has the discovery of their \"true\" gender used as a cheap plot device that's not handled with very much sensitivity.)</p><p style=\"\">Though Danganronpa comes from a niche genre, I'm convinced it's only niche because more people haven't given it a chance. Visual novels have a bad reputation, albeit not entirely unearned. But don't let that stop you. As far as entry points go, Danganronpa is a great one, even if 999 and VLR are better games. If you like what you see here, more strangeness awaits you. Danganropa's tongue-twisting sci-fi (or is it?) narrative will have you constantly second guessing, and while the game-y parts aren't its strongest point, they work well enough.</p>", "deck": "You're never going to be bored in Hope's Peak Academy's wild world of murder, despair, and bears, but you might occasionally wonder why it's a game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-631/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (Vita)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33341/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/3030-33341/", "id": 33341, "name": "Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2014-03-11 11:20:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-131360/", "id": 131360, "name": "Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/yoshi-s-new-island-review/1900-633/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> isn't a company that gets truly weird all that often, which is why <a href=\"/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/3030-2866/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2866\">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a> continues to stand out. It's a psychedelic platformer with a screaming baby used to remind players they're screwing up. It's beautiful, strange, and the company doesn't return to the idea of a Yoshi-focused platformer very often. There's good reason for that, too. <a href=\"/yoshis-story/3030-15207/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15207\">Yoshi's Story</a> was an abomination, and does anyone even remember <a href=\"/yoshis-island-ds/3030-10347/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10347\">Yoshi's Island DS</a>?

It's not a bad game, really, but it's an entirely pedestrian platformer.

In the Yoshi's Island universe, storks deliver babies to...well, it's not clear. You never see the faces of the island residents, so we're not even sure if they're human. They live in mushroom huts, though. Anyway. The stork is delivering <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>, but drops them off at the wrong house. In the rush to find their real home, <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Baby Bowser</a> sends his minions to intercept the two children. Why? It doesn't matter. Stop overthinking this one. Baby Bowser has taken over the land the yoshi clan call home, and Mario needs to find his brother. The two sides decide to team up.</p><p style=\"\">The basic gameplay remains unchanged in Yoshi's New Island. You control different colored yoshis, though each functions the same. Mario rides on the yoshi's back, and if a yoshi is touched by something nasty, Mario starts flying away in a bubble of his own crying snot. A timer starts to tick down, and if Mario isn't rescued in time, it's game over. You start each level with 10 seconds to grab Mario, and a meter charges back up to 10 again once he's safe. The yoshis are able to stick out their tongues and swallow enemies to produce eggs, which can then be shot to destroy enemies, collect coins, or break open certain objects in the world. Pressing X emits a dotted line that moves up and down, and that line can be paused mid-air with L to ensure precision. The big addition to Yoshi's New Island are giant enemies that can be used to crush specific parts of the world. Yoshi's New Island, sadly, makes sparing use of this new idea.</p><p style=\"\">Each level contains three collectibles, as well: stars, red coins, and flowers. None of these are required to complete any given stage, and are mostly meant to encourage exploration and experimentation with the game's mechanics within each level. Yoshi's New Island does not feature the level-ending minigames of Yoshi's Island, but when players jump through the hoop at the end of each stage, it's possible for the hoop's meter to land on a flower, which garners the player medals. Collecting medals gives the player additional lives, but dying is not really a concern in this game. The collectibles unlock secret stages, a la Yoshi's Island.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2609128-6308078119-3ds_y.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2609128\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2609128-6308078119-3ds_y.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2609128\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/9/93998/2609128-6308078119-3ds_y.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The genius of the red coins is that they're often hidden in a plethora of yellow ones.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"> <div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Several worlds into Yoshi's New Island's six areas, I kept waiting for the game to finally start. There is a challenge arc to modern Nintendo platformers. The first few worlds might not provide much difficulty for a player versed in Nintendo's past, but, eventually, the game will leave newcomers behind, asking them to indulge in the game's handholding item that springs to life after several deaths. This shift does come in Yoshi's New Island, but it doesn't happen until the final world, and it's too little, too late. World six is when the game decides to challenge players to combine well-timed jumps with very specific skill shots in order to advance forward, let alone collect everything that's scattered about. Those last eight stages are fantastic, a window into a game that isn't present anywhere else. For a while, I thought Yoshi's New Island was going to pull the same trick as <a href=\"/super-mario-3d-land/3030-34303/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34303\">Super Mario 3D Land</a>, opening up another set of six worlds that put my skills to a true test, but it never happens. The credits roll, and it's all over just as it was beginning.</p><p style=\"\">World six is the only time Yoshi's New Island felt like the classic it takes inspiration from. For the most part, though, Yoshi's New Island plays like a game trying really hard to grab elements from Yoshi's Island without knowing what to do with them. Everything you'd expect from a new Yoshi's Island game is here, including vehicle transformations (now largely handled by tilting the 3DS, which works well enough) and eating watermelon. But the game does so little with every one of these elements that it's strange the game decides to include them at all. It often feels like a forced nod to the foundation driving Yoshi's New Island, not a gameplay addition the designers had lots of ideas for. The moment a new gameplay wrinkle is introduced, it largely disappears. Maybe it comes back later in the game, maybe it doesn't. But the game rarely builds upon what it introduces to players, making these fleeting glances at variety frustrating.</p><p style=\"\">As you make your way through the game, you'll also unlock various cooperative and competitive two-player game modes. These cannot be played online, but can be shared with another 3DS with a single copy of the game. Players compete by fluttering across the sky the longest, popping the most balloons, etc.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2609125-0671411247-yoshi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2609125\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2609125-0671411247-yoshi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2609125\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2609125-0671411247-yoshi.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93998/2609125-0671411247-yoshi.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Like many 3DS games, it looks better on a real 3DS than it does in blown up screen shots, but it doesn't fix the art.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">What the new game does nail is the satisfaction of exploration. Yoshi's Island is an enjoyable platformer when straightforwardly progressing from the beginning to the end, but Yoshi's Island's level design <em>really</em> shined when players took the game's abundance of collectibles not as level padding but as an incentive to make the most of your moveset. Often, the regular path in a Yoshi's New Island stage will grant you most of the game's three collectables...but not all of them. The rest are found in secret paths, some only accessible using the game's tricky double jump, and others only unearthed when you've physically passed over them. Unlike the recent <a href=\"/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze/3030-42932/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42932\">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a>, there is no item to make these secrets easier to find. Totally clearing out a stage becomes its own, separate challenge, one gratifying for different reasons. The game doesn't require players to engage with this side of the game, but it really helps you appreciate the thought put into some of the seemingly simplistic levels. There might be more to them.</p><p style=\"\">It would help, of course, if the stages themselves were a little more interesting to look at. If Yoshi's Island is known for anything, it's the trippy aesthetic. To an extent, that's present in Yoshi's New Island, but like the mechanics it drags in and does little with, the look of the game feels half-hearted. At first glance, it certainly looks like Yoshi's Island, but it lacks the sense of inspired style or flair that defined the original. Yoshi's Island, an intentional and directed reaction to the CG approach for <a href=\"/donkey-kong-country/3030-15738/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15738\">Donkey Kong Country</a>, looks like a game drawn by the most skilled child artist in the world--beautiful and messy. Yoshi's New Island is an adult trying to capture the recklessness of his youth. It's a game without a proper identity, past or present.

That's an odd thing to write, considering that the whole game essentially boils down to one killer mechanic mixed with a sepia-toned aesthetic. There's no big world here to explore, no quests to embark on, no storytelling of any kind. It's just a shooter, the kind that, at first blush, doesn't seem all that different than any other bullet hell brand of shooter released in the last couple of decades. But once you start flying one of Luftrausers' myriad ship types around its war-torn skies, something takes hold of you. Hours pass as you mix and match weapons and engines and body types, chasing after difficult goals, elusive blimps, and an ever-higher score. It doesn't matter that you're essentially engaging the same exact battle over and over again, because there are so many different ways to approach it. Every fight inevitably ends in the same fiery death, but the gameplay is so grippingly good that all you'll want to do is try and try again.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/149021/2485951-0757671447-87652.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2485951\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/149021/2485951-0757671447-87652.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2485951\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/14/149021/2485951-0757671447-87652.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Luftrausers is a tremendously fun blend of intense shooting and deft aerial acrobatics.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I'm not naive enough to assume that everyone who plays it will turn Luftrausers into an obsession, but I'm betting that most who do will at least lose a few accidental hours to it. It helps that jumping into the game is exquisitely easy. The tutorial is brief, showing you only the basic controls--up boosts your ship, letting go of the up button causes it to stall and drift downward, X fires your gun--before turning you loose in an aerial battlefield full of enemy fighters, homing missiles, and sea-bound attack ships. At the outset, you're given a basic machine gun weapon, and entirely functional body/engine designs. Those simple-sounding controls are a bit more challenging in a full-on firefight, in that balancing boost and stalling, while rotating your plane to fire at nearby enemies, takes some getting used to. At the bottom of the screen is the sea, and at the very top is cloud cover. Both are danger zones that do damage to your plane if you linger there too long. In effect, your task in Luftrausers is to boost, drop, and pirouette around the skies while trying to stay somewhere in the middle of the screen, dodging enemy fire and kamikaze pilots all the while.</p><p style=\"\">This results in what at times feels like an aerial acrobatic routine. Of course, it's an acrobatic routine that requires you to gun down enemies in the process. Doing so is how you score points. Each kill ticks up a combo counter until you reach a maximum of 20x the base score. Going too long without killing an enemy causes the combo counter to reset, but at the same time, just holding down the fire button gives you no chance to regain health. Only by flying around sans any gunfire will your ship recharge, making for an ingenious little risk/reward system. Do you keep firing at that elite pilot that keeps haranguing you in the hopes of keeping your score high, or do you let off for a few seconds to ensure your survival?</p><p style=\"\">As tough as all this sounds, Luftrausers' tight controls mean it won't take you long to get the hang of the basic mechanics. Where the longer-term challenge comes from is finding the right combination of weapon, body, and engine for the way you prefer to play. There are many varieties of each, which unlock as you progress and complete in-game challenges (shoot a number of enemies, kill an ace pilot at max combo, etc). Guns include spread shots, continuous laser blasts, and homing missiles that aren't super great at the whole \"homing\" thing. Bodies can allow you take more damage, negate crash damage, or even just launch huge, screen-clearing nukes when you die. Engine varieties offer speed boosts, underwater flying sans damage, or the ability to literally propel yourself with bullets. Mixing and matching ship types becomes its own little metagame as you try to find the combo that best suits your abilities. Not every single unlock is a winner, and there are several that I found just about zero use for whatsoever. But there are enough different unlockables to keep you trying different combos for at least a few hours, and using the randomization option can sometimes lead to winning combinations you'd never expect.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The game even makes subtle aesthetic changes depending on what combination of parts you put together. Each combination gives the ship a distinct look, and each comes with its own unique name which appears at the bottom of the screen when you first launch into battle. The soundtrack changes as well, blending different instrument tracks into subtle variances of the same high-tension battle anthems. These little alterations go a long way toward negating any feelings of over-repetition, especially given that, again, there's only one battle environment you fight in. It's a cool-looking environment to be sure, propped up by a variety of unlockable color schemes (some of which are great, others of which make the game difficult to look at), and a mostly smooth framerate. The only time the game chugs is when you're taking huge chunks of damage, and that seems to be more by design than anything else.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2611237-screen3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2611237\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2611237-screen3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2611237\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2611237-screen3.png\"></a><figcaption>No matter how many times you die, no matter how stupidly you die, you'll keep coming back for more. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The only downside to Luftrausers' single-minded design is that once you've unlocked everything and found your winning combination of plane parts, your interest level may wane. A harder difficulty level can be unlocked by defeating one of the super-hard dirigibles that show up after surviving in battle for a while, but it's excruciating. Shooter masochists may love it, but most will probably just find it harrowing in all the wrong ways. That means that for most players, the reward for continuous play will simply be to unlock all the available parts, and work toward getting the highest score you can.</p><p style=\"\">For me at least, that was enough to get me to spend nearly the entirety of Luftrausers' launch day firmly planted in front of my <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>, diving into battle after battle in hopes of increasing my spot on the leaderboards.

There are vague references to the past, but this game is about a new set of characters dealing with a new set of problems. As such, this third Infamous game is a solid entry point for new players, while existing fans will probably enjoy seeing the impact made by events of <a href=\"/infamous-2/3030-31150/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31150\">Infamous 2</a>'s \"good\" ending. Either way, players take on the role of <a href=\"/delsin-rowe/3005-25662/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25662\">Delsin Rowe</a>, a small-town miscreant with a sheriff brother and a penchant for stenciled <a href=\"/graffiti/3015-208/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-208\">graffiti</a>. Delsin's life is changed when a military transport hauling three conduits--the game's term for humans with various super powers--crashes right in front of him, allowing the mutants to escape. This is also when Delsin learns that he, too, is a conduit when he touches one of the escapees and gains his smoke-based powers. As this is a world where those conduits are more commonly referred to as \"bio-terrorists\" and are locked up in a special camp simply for having these abilities, this quickly turns Delsin's world upside-down. After a government agent on the hunt for the missing conduits tears through the small town, crippling many of its citizens with her own special powers, Delsin vows to make it right by going into nearby <a href=\"/seattle/3035-517/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-517\">Seattle</a>, where the agent--and the missing conduits--have set up shop. What he finds is a city under the watchful, prying eye of government surveillance, from checkpoints to mounted cameras to an army of troops with special powers, all trained to catch the remaining conduits. As Delsin, you'll smash it all to bits and take it back for the people... or yourself.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2611295-screen+shot+2014-03-19+at+5.29.53+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2611295\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56137607505864\" data-width=\"1279\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2611295-screen+shot+2014-03-19+at+5.29.53+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2611295\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/26/2611295-screen+shot+2014-03-19+at+5.29.53+pm.png\"></a></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/moral-decisions/3015-93/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-93\">Karma</a> once again plays a role in this third Infamous game, but it again lacks nuance. The choices you make are very binary and helpfully color-coded. Making blue choices slides your karma in the good direction, and red choices are evil. In-game, this means that you can do things like subdue enemies in a non-lethal way or obliterate them with animated takedowns, head shots, and so on. A small batch of choices also manifest during the story, letting you decide if specific characters live or die, giving other characters different motivations to either help society or help you wipe it out, and so on. The people in your life treat you differently as you proceed, and the citizens of Seattle will either laud you as a new super hero or cower in fear. Actually, even if you're a good guy, most of the citizens will cower or scurry away if you use a power in front of them, which seems sort of strange since they all seem to know who you are and what you're capable of after you've established yourself. As you push further and further in one direction, different abilities become available to you. Going evil opens up with lethal options while staying blue gives you options to better subdue your opponents. While it might sound a little boring, the blue track still gets plenty of entertaining abilities to use in combat, so opting to not murder everyone in sight doesn't make the combat feel weak. It mostly just means that you shouldn't shoot at civilians, if you can help it, and you'll be aiming for footshots instead of headshots. The game has enough little, repeatable karmic events to make up for any mishaps you might make along the way, and I didn't have any trouble getting to the top of the good side's power tree by the end of the 15-or-so hours it took to complete the story and 100 percent of the side content.</p><p style=\"\">The powers at your disposal are pretty recognizable if you've played previous games in the series, even if the power sources are different. You'll still shoot bolts from your fists, you can briefly hover and glide, toss grenade-like attacks, and so on. The properties of your powers make those attacks a little different, though. You'll start out with smoke-based power and get the ability to toss grenades that cause nearby enemies to start coughing, leaving them open and letting you quickly deal with them. You'll also get a heavy projectile attack with each of the powers, and this is useful for taking out helicopters, APCs, and heavy troopers. While you'll start with smoke, you'll eventually encounter bosses and earn the ability to use additional power sources. You can suck energy out of the various power sources around the city, so hopping up to the rooftops and finding chimneys is a great way to replenish your smoke abilities, and so on. You can only have one power source active at a time, and you switch between them by siphoning off of the different power sources. It's an effective way to switch things around, but it makes the progression a little bland since you'll rarely want to switch back to an older power source once you get something new, especially once you've invested some blast shards--which are strewn about the world and easily marked on the map--to make your abilities a little easier to use. If you collect all the shards, you'll have exactly enough to purchase every upgrade, save for the ones that get locked out due to your alignment.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2611296-screen+shot+2014-03-19+at+5.28.48+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2611296\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56215793588741\" data-width=\"1279\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2611296-screen+shot+2014-03-19+at+5.28.48+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2611296\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2611296-screen+shot+2014-03-19+at+5.28.48+pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2611296-screen+shot+2014-03-19+at+5.28.48+pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Most of the enemies use concrete powers to keep you at bay. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game has main, story-progressing missions that you'll need to complete, but the whole city is open to you right away. Seattle is broken up into districts, and the map tells you precisely how many collectable shards, breakable cameras, graffiti spots, and other side content is available in each district. Clearing out a district triggers a \"takeover\" mission where you have to fight off a handful of troops. Doing this clears out random patrols of enemy soldiers and enables fast travel to that zone... but since you have to travel to a fast travel point to actually fast travel, I think I used that twice throughout the entire game. Overall, the game has a lot of great main missions, and though the side missions and collectables are very easy to handle, the side content isn't unique at all, and simply gets duplicated across every district in the game. It's a portion of the game that doesn't overstay its welcome, and I ended up completing 100% of the game right around the time I got tired of tracking down secret agents and engaging with the very simple graffiti stenciling mechanic.</p><p style=\"\">One of the biggest draws of Second Son has to be its graphics. This is a fantastic-looking game, from the character models to the animation to the world itself. Delsin and the other main characters are extremely well-animated, allowing the models to convey proper, subtle emotion. The world and its lighting really goes a long way, too, especially in the opening sequences and the game's larger setpieces. Even outside of cutscenes, the characters have a level of detail to them that you don't see in a lot of other games, and the whole thing runs at a good, stable frame rate. The performances from the voice cast really come through in the visuals and the main characters are very well-performed, even if it occasionally feels like Sucker Punch went out and hired the most common and frequently used voice actors they could find.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Infamous: Second Son is brief, but engaging.

Given this profoundly unattractive value proposition, it's a good thing Ground Zeroes is actually highly replayable and offers a lot more side content than you might think at first.

That said, if you're like me and all but ignored Peace Walker, you'll want to read the dense recap of that game's events available from the main menu here before you undertake the main mission. Otherwise the characters and events of Ground Zeroes won't mean a whole hell of a lot. The game relegates most of Metal Gear's typical absurdity to the periphery of the short storyline, instead focusing primarily on the private-army and nuclear-proliferation stuff that was the series' stock in trade for its first 15 years. It's worth noting the story visits a number of violations on one character in particular that hover somewhere between unpleasant and grotesque. Some of that stuff exists in collectibles, but one in particular is part of the core storyline and is unavoidable.</p><p style=\"\">I stopped showing up to Metal Gear looking for satisfying stealth gameplay a long time ago, so it was surprising how much I enjoyed roaming around Ground Zeroes' lone military base, shooting guards with tranquilizer darts, hiding bodies, interrogating guards for info...all the stuff a super spy is able to do. The stealth feels dynamic; guards run a wide variety of patrol routes, occasionally get in and drive vehicles around, and mostly behave in a pretty believable way whether you're secure in the shadows or they think they've seen you moving around. On the normal difficulty, the game really empowers you to stay hidden. You can tag enemies, vehicles, turrets, and security cameras by aiming at them with your weapon or binoculars, after which you'll always be able to see them through walls and as icons on your map. And when you get caught, the game gives you a pretty generous slow-mo period so you can try to quietly take out whoever spotted you before they raise an alarm. Combine this stuff with other modern third-person amenities like a proper dash and responsive aim-and-shoot control and Ground Zeroes starts to feel like a really damn playable stealth game.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2610815-8_rescue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2610815\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2610815-8_rescue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2610815\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2610815-8_rescue.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Each side mission is set at a different time of day, keeping the visuals fresh.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That main story won't take you long even your first time through, although if you aim for an S rank, you'll have to play pretty meticulously without getting spotted. But I found it highly replayable, going through it four times and having a pretty different experience, sneaking around different parts of the base and having different emergent guard encounters, each time. Ground Zeroes makes it feel like the game designers really get how to put an interesting stealth-based open world together. As a good counterbalance to the brevity of the main story, there's also a truly respectable amount of side content that opens up after you finish your mission. There are a handful of alternate operations set in the same base that each give you a brief story setup, different objectives, and a different time of day that refreshes the visual style of the environment, setting it apart from the main story's rainy nighttime motif. The game is also rife with collectibles and tracks a lot of real-time challenges like headshot distance, two-wheel driving time, and how fast you can tag every enemy in the base. If all you want to do is see that main story once, $30 is asking way too much. But factoring in all that side content will easily get you at least a good six or eight hours out of Ground Zeroes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2610813-6_shooting.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2610813\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2610813-6_shooting.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2610813\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2610813-6_shooting.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2610813-6_shooting.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Snake and a little of the ol' left-trigger-right-trigger.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This package also acts as a great showcase for the new <a href=\"/fox-engine/3015-7011/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7011\">Fox Engine</a>, and an indication of what the new consoles can actually do. The PS4 version looks absolutely fantastic, running at a solid 60 frames per second with some great lighting effects coming from the base's various searchlights and other light sources. (The inclusion of everyone's favorite canvas for lighting effects, wet pavement, certainly helps.) The game is no slouch on the Xbox One, running just as smoothly and with all the same effects, though it isn't as sharp as the PS4 and has an unsightly screen door effect in some of its transparent objects. The lower resolution was pretty obvious to me sitting three feet from the TV on my desk, but in my living room at home the difference was minimal enough to be barely noticeable. Each platform has an exclusive, quirky side mission that ties into various aspects of the Metal Gear lore, and the Xbox's mission is arguably more interesting than the one you get on the PS4. I'd still lean toward the PS4 version for its overall sharper presentation, but you can't really go wrong with either one.</p><p style=\"\">Ground Zeroes is a strange product, appearing like such a bad deal initially but then more than making up for it with side content you can't access until later.

Here is a game that seeks to evoke the kind of wondrous storytelling you'd find in any childhood storybook. This is a playable fairy tale, replete with all the magical kingdoms, evil stepmothers, quirky adventurers, rhyming dialogue, and hand-drawn artwork that such a description would typically come along with. Yet despite having all the pieces seemingly in place, something about Child of Light remains pervasively <em>off</em>. For all its allusions of wonder and childlike fantasy, its story rarely finds way to inspire any such feelings. Quirky characters continuously pop up, the plot twists and turns as any good fairy tale should, and all throughout, Child of Light delivers visual splendor after visual splendor. Yet, little of it sticks. Even now, mere hours after finishing the game, I'm finding myself oddly struggling to come up with one memorable detail about my time in Child of Light's world beyond its mere aesthetic pleasures.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2616650-028441.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2616650\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.60606060606061\" data-width=\"495\" style=\"width: 495px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2616650-028441.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2616650\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/9493/2616650-028441.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's a shame the game doesn't do a better job endearing its characters to the player. That constant rhyming dialogue certainly does them no favors.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Maybe \"mere\" is the wrong word, given how tremendously good Child of Light looks. Using <a href=\"/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-82\">Ubisoft</a>'s trademark UbiArt engine (which has most recently been used to bring <a href=\"/rayman-origins/3030-31721/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31721\">Rayman Origins</a> and <a href=\"/rayman-legends/3030-38141/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38141\">Rayman Legends</a> to life), Child of Light paints its magical world with tremendous care. Every character looks like it could have come from an old hand-painted book, every environment is full of amazing detail, and it all animates with a fluidity that makes every on-screen action--up to a point--enrapturing. Those visuals are complimented by a terrific soundtrack by <a href=\"/coeur-de-pirate/3040-107846/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-107846\">Cœur de Pirate</a>, one that's as good at emphasizing the (supposed) intensity of the game's battles as it is underscoring the tranquil beauty of the game's many low-key moments.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame, then, that Child of Light's best qualities are only skin-deep. As a fairy tale, it's fairly bland. You play as Aurora, a princess from the magical fantasy kingdom of...Austria. No, this isn't a game about a girl trekking up the Grossglockner Alpine Road. Early on, Aurora finds herself transported against her will to the land of Lemuria, a place where wizard gnomes, depressed circus performers, mercantile mice, and a variety of other people find themselves oppressed by a dark queen of...darkness? Evil? I don't know, to be perfectly frank. I read every line of dialogue in Child of Light, and I still found myself frequently wondering just what the heck was going on. Some of the details of the world and its various issues are filled in by collectible \"confessions,\" which you'll find floating around, but that's hardly an ideal way to keep a player fixated on a story. The key thing to understand is that Aurora desperately wants to go home to her father, who has become gravely ill in her absence. Everything else around that core plot detail isn't particularly necessary.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">This means that it's okay if you find yourself itching to skip through the game's aggressively twee dialogue. Everything in Child of Light rhymes. <em>Everything</em>. Nobody can say anything to anyone without a cutesy rhyme coming somewhere near the end of it. I understand why this is the case. Fairy tales are often told in rhyme, and that's what Child of Light is trying to be. Unfortunately, those rhymes are often more confusing than clever. Dialogue that should just be explaining what's happening often feels needlessly convoluted. When the game starts making jokes about characters that can't make rhymes, it proceeds to run those jokes into the ground almost immediately. There are at least a few instances where it tries to rhyme words that absolutely do not. It's a messy script made worse by the distinct lack of voice work. I don't mind reading in-game dialogue, but with a script so clearly meant to be lyrical in its delivery, at a certain point the words all just started to blend together in a bunch of sing-songy nonsense in my head.</p><p style=\"\">So the story may be a wash, but there is still the whole game portion of the equation to consider. In this regard, Child of Light fares better, but still finds itself stumbling over its own aspirations.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2616648-028439.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2616648\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56222222222222\" data-width=\"900\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2616648-028439.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2616648\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/9493/2616648-028439.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Child of Light is undeniably beautiful to look at. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Child of Light is a turn-based role-playing game. You navigate Aurora through the world of Lemuria either by running or by flying (an ability she gains soon after arriving). Every time you encounter an enemy on screen, you have two options. You can try to avoid the fight by zooming right past, or you can try to take them head-on. Assuming you do find yourself in battle, two characters from your party will appear on the battle screen alongside up to three enemies. The flow of battle is dictated entirely by a bar that sits at the bottom of the screen. On it, icons depicting each character will race toward a section of the bar that allows you to perform an action. This can be an attack, assuming a defensive position, using a potion, or any number of other things. The key is timing your actions against those of your enemies. Everything you do (outside of the defensive stance, which is instant) takes time to enact. If an enemy attacks you while you're in the middle of casting a spell, it will interrupt you, thus negating the spell and sending you back to the beginning of the bar.</p><p style=\"\">Initially, this system creates a thrilling little risk/reward mechanic for how you approach battles. The only real advantage you have comes in the form of a little elemental spirit, which you control with the right stick (or a second player can control with another controller). Hovering this glowing ball over a specific enemy slows their progress on the bar, while hovering it over one of your party members slowly increases their health. That spirit can't do either of those things forever, mind you. You can collect energy for it using various plants that are scattered throughout the world and in battle screens, but they're limited.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, that initial thrill is negated pretty quickly by Child of Light's dearth of challenge. Most battles for the first seven or so hours of the game are a breeze. It doesn't really matter which party members you use in what situation, because few enemies are strong enough to put up a hard fight. While the easy response to this might be to just skip most battles, that means you won't be leveling up your characters, which is problematic when you first start facing tougher bosses. This turns Child of Light into a bit of an unfortunate grind, where you'll find yourself in battle after battle against mostly dull-witted foes for hours on end.</p><p style=\"\">At least there is some room for variance in who you choose to bring into battle. Each character has their own set of abilities. One, for instance, is a wizard whose magical attacks play into the various elemental weaknesses of your enemies. Another, a sad jester you meet early on, mostly provides healing and spell boosts to your other party members, while occasionally making use of a quick \"tumble\" attack that outpaces most other enemy attacks. Each character is nicely varied, and a big part of the strategy comes from figuring out which pairing of party members best suits the enemies you're presented with. The problem is, you don't really have to start developing those strategies until considerably later in the game. I don't think I even bothered to swap a party member mid-battle until over halfway through Child of Light's 12-hour story. And by that point I'd gotten so used to everyone's attack rhythms that I was still trouncing most every enemy encounter.</p><p style=\"\">Part of that probably stems from the insane frequency with which your characters level up. Every character comes with an almost ludicrously lengthy skill tree, full of minor and major upgrades for every statistical category and ability. The way things are paced, you level up after every few fights, which means you're constantly going into the game menu to fiddle around with which upgrade to assign. A lot of these are pretty inconsequential, and exist mostly as a way to space out larger upgrades that come after every four or five small ones, but there are still so many of them that it feels like you're constantly staring at that skill tree, which does break up the pacing of the game a bit. Far worse and much more useless is the game's \"occuli\" system, which lets you combine collected gems into buffs you can assign each character. The buffs themselves aren't without value, but having to sit and combine gem after gem while trying to chase down the ideal boosts for each character is the opposite of fun. It's just tedious busywork.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2616653-028444.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2616653\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56222222222222\" data-width=\"900\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2616653-028444.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2616653\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/9493/2616653-028444.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/9493/2616653-028444.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's a lot of leveling up to be done in Child of Light, as this beast of a skill tree demonstrates.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The good news is that Child of Light does get better as it goes along. Once you start fighting bosses and delving into some of the game's more elaborate dungeons, the game finally starts finding ways to trip you up. And with that added challenge, fights become more strategic, more intense, and generally more fun. That fun comes only about four or so hours from the game's conclusion, but those four hours are far more enjoyable than the preceding seven or eight. It's worth noting that Child of Light only comes with two difficulty settings, and at the time of release, those were titled \"normal\" and \"hard.\" Apparently those designations are going to be patched to say \"casual\" and \"expert,\" which feel more accurate to what the game actually presents. I restarted the game on \"hard\" after finishing it on \"normal,\" and while the difficulty increase does make enemy encounters tougher, it doesn't entirely negate the sluggish, grindy feel of the early parts of the game. You just have to work a little harder to dispatch a lot of enemies that still don't require a ton of strategy to best.</p><p style=\"\">Even with all these issues, I felt like Child of Light was a game worth seeing through to the end. Up until those last few hours, I was ready to write it off entirely. It's a shame that it takes so long to find its groove, and even when it does, it's not as if the story becomes markedly better, the dialogue any less obnoxiously opaque, nor the gameplay any less rote. But in those few hours, you catch a glimpse of a stronger, more thoughtful, more engaging experience than the gorgeous, but disappointingly empty one that makes up too much of Child of Light.</p>", "deck": "As visually resplendent and periodically fun as Child of Light can be, it too often buckles under the weight of its own aspirations.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-638/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-43612/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/child-of-light/3030-43612/", "id": 43612, "name": "Child of Light"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2014-05-07 13:50:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-133725/", "id": 133725, "name": "Child of Light"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mario-kart-8-review/1900-639/", "description": "<p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Here are the important things to know about <a href=\"/mario-kart-8/3030-42929/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42929\">Mario Kart 8</a>:</p><ul><li>Though it combines anti-gravity, underwater, and gliding sections throughout every course, the fundamental driving mechanics are just how you remember from pretty much every Mario Kart ever made.</li><li>At least four or five of the new courses are among the very best in the series.</li><li>I did not love the selection of \"classic courses\" <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> picked for this game, but that's a highly subjective opinion.</li><li>It's probably the best looking <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> game to date.</li><li>The online play works.</li><li>Battle mode has inexplicably been made godawful.</li><li>The theme song for the new <a href=\"/bowsers-castle/3035-685/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-685\">Bowser Castle</a> level has been stuck in my head for the last two weeks.</li><li>There are too many baby characters.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2633175-b00dc7g2w8_finishline_lg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633175\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2633175-b00dc7g2w8_finishline_lg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633175\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2633175-b00dc7g2w8_finishline_lg.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Do you like Mario Kart? Good. Here is some more Mario Kart.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Obviously these above statements do not make for a full review, hence why there are several more paragraphs below this one. But I wanted to put these points up front because they are what stuck out most in my head as I reviewed this, the eighth Mario Kart game. I have played every game in this series, and enjoyed most of them. It has never mattered all that much to me that Nintendo doesn't radically change the Mario Kart formula from sequel to sequel, because the core game has remained fun, even after all these years. Maybe I get bored with one sequel more quickly than another, but I always play them, and I always manage to wring at least some enjoyment out of them. There has never been a bad Mario Kart game in my estimation, but not all of them are great. Mario Kart 8 is greater than the average Mario Kart game, but not the very best in the series. I expect that statement, coupled with the above bullet points, is probably enough information to get most Nintendo fans to run out and pre-order, if they haven't already.</p><p style=\"\">For those who need a bit more in the way of details, the most important thing to consider in any Mario Kart is how well the driving handles. Mario Kart 8 is a delight in this regard. You can choose from a wide variety of characters, karts, wheels, and gliders when preparing for a race. All have their own ratings in weight, speed, handling, and the like, and mixing and matching combinations is something I still find myself experimenting with, even after playing for a couple of weeks. The differences aren't minor, and it's entirely possible to pick a character/kart combo that is disastrously unwieldy. Finding that sweet spot is tough, but very satisfying when you hit it.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Once you get into a race, you'll find all the familiar mechanics you'd expect. Pressing the right trigger sends your character into a drift, which can be used for minor speed boosts. Weapons can be acquired via boxes littered throughout every track, and all the usual suspects--speed boosting mushrooms, invincibility stars, peels of banana, and shells of green and red and horrible, detestable blue--are on hand, and function as you will remember. Newer weapons include fireballs, a boomerang, a chomping piranha plant, an update of the grab-bag weapon that surrounds you with like eight different weapon choices, and a horn that sends a shockwave toward everything in your immediate path. That last weapon is perhaps the most notable among them, if only because it's the first weapon to allow players to negate a blue shell. Blue shells have always been unstoppable nightmare weapons, but if you have the horn you can ward off a blue shell so long as you time the attack right, which isn't very difficult. It's not often that a player at the head of the pack will have this weapon, so the opportunities to use it are few and far between. But that the option is there at all is a welcome change of pace.</p><p style=\"\">Mario Kart 8 also brings back coins as a method for increasing your kart's speed. You'll find them scattered all over every course, and each one you collect gives you a progressive speed boost that maxes out when you get to 10. You'll also get a pair of coins as a weapon, usually when you're up near the top of the pack, which I guess is fine except for how frequently you get them. I'd much rather have a green shell or a banana peel than extra coins that don't have much use once I'm already in the lead, but that seems to be the weapon you get dealt most often.</p><p style=\"\">There are 16 new courses in Mario Kart 8, along with 16 older courses that have been redesigned for the various quirks of the game's new driving engine. Those quirks include multiple sections where you'll drive underwater, glide through the air, or flip and zip on walls and ceilings using a new anti-gravity mechanic. You don't have to actually do anything special to drive through these bits, mind you. Everything activates automatically, and apart from making the screen look particularly crazy when you're driving upside down, none of these variances do much to change the act of driving your kart. That said, the sheer variety of paths and change-ups is pretty great, especially in the newer courses.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2632971-wiiu_screenshot_tv_01dvk5i.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2632971\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2632971-wiiu_screenshot_tv_01dvk5i.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2632971\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/8/82063/2632971-wiiu_screenshot_tv_01dvk5i.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Bowser Castles usually drive me crazy, but I adore this new one, and not just because of the soundtrack (though that certainly helps).</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">These tracks are where Mario Kart 8 shines brightest. They're often tough, but incredibly satisfying to drive on. A few particular highlights for me were the lap-less Wario Mountain, the disco-tinged Electrodome, and the new Bowser Castle, which features a giant lava statue of Bowser literally punching the course in rhythm to the dueling electric guitar/horn section solos of the soundtrack. There are others, and it's great how many of the new courses manage to stand out. It's just a shame the \"classic\" courses are less memorable. Again, this is a highly subjective thing. One person's Coconut Mall is another person's DK Jungle, after all. I just didn't like most of the selections Nintendo made here, though at the very least they've been retrofitted pretty well for the added mechanics of this sequel.</p><p style=\"\">Character variety is also a little lacking. There are certainly lots to choose from, including newcomers like the <a href=\"/koopalings/3015-3991/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3991\">Koopaling</a>s. But for as many characters as the game offers, few feel like especially worthwhile additions. It's always felt to me like Nintendo has struggled to come up with more interesting characters as each sequel adds more and more of them. I remember the Koopalings, but I don't necessarily remember them well enough to be excited by their inclusion. That the roster also includes metallic versions of <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and <a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Peach</a>, plus five (!!!) baby versions of characters is perhaps emblematic of a need to branch out beyond the purest reaches of the Mario universe for future games. Maybe a <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3025-318/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-318\">Smash Bros</a>. approach is in order?</p><p style=\"\">Regardless of character variety issues or lacking classic courses, Mario Kart 8 is just a lot of fun, whether you're playing offline or on. It's understandable if you have some trepidation regarding online play, given Nintendo's sometimes inexplicable bungling of online features in games, but Mario Kart 8 demonstrated few problems during my time with it. Granted, I only got to play against other critics, but I got into some full lobbies during my testing, and many of those were populated with players from various corners of Europe. Yet I saw no lag when I played, and encountered no issues whatsoever dropping into a match or out. There are some interface quirks, to be sure. The in-game friends list doesn't do a great job of showing you up-front whether a player can be joined or not (though that information does come once you drill a bit deeper), and unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to change characters or karts after you've joined a lobby unless I backed out of the lobby altogether. Beyond that though, there's a solid array of options for online play beyond typical races. One mode lets you change the rules in a variety of ways--only allowing certain types of weapons, only allowing players to use bikes, etc--and you can do the same when setting up online tournaments.</p><p style=\"\">You can also play battle mode online, though I don't actually recommend playing it under <em>any</em> circumstances. Battle mode has never been my favorite feature of Mario Kart anyway, but it was a ton of fun in some of the older games. This version of battle mode is just awful. Why? Because there are no battle arenas. The core mechanic of giving each character three balloons and a series of weapons with which to pop other players' balloons is still present, but you're battling on existing courses--and only the classic courses, to boot. This means you'll be driving around in circles in either direction trying (and often failing) to find opponents to hit, rather than just battling it out on a course designed for battles like this. It's an insane change that I absolutely cannot fathom an explanation for. It is immediately apparent from the first battle that this is no fun at all, so I would find it hard to believe that Nintendo wouldn't have noticed this while testing the game. It's so bizarre and disappointing.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2633226-mario-kart-8-boomerang.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633226\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2633226-mario-kart-8-boomerang.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633226\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2633226-mario-kart-8-boomerang.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2633226-mario-kart-8-boomerang.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mario Kart 8 is pretty much the Mario Kart we've always known, but it's one of the better versions of it. I give it four Mario Karts out of Mario Kart.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That the battle mode is the only part of Mario Kart 8 I found particularly distressing is perhaps a testament to how good it is overall. No, this Mario Kart is not a radical formula change in any way, but if you're still expecting Nintendo to do such a thing after so many sequels featuring more or less the same game, I feel like maybe it's time to just let that dream die peacefully. Mario Kart 8 is very much the expected, but even the expected can be entertaining when it's done right. And I think Mario Kart 8 mostly does its expected things quite well. It takes the familiar mechanics of the series, adds a few fancy bells and whistles to them, then drops them into a world that's been polished to a glistening, <em>finally</em> HD sheen. In that respect, Mario Kart 8 is probably the best visual showpiece for the Wii U yet. It looks like the game we all kind of wished <a href=\"/mario-kart-wii/3030-20645/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20645\">Mario Kart Wii</a> was; bright, colorful, and exquisitely detailed. You probably won't notice all that detail until you watch someone else play it, but even as you're tooling around each course, it's hard to keep your eyes from wandering from one visual flourish or another. There's a lot to see, and it all looks spectacular.</p><p style=\"\">Maybe hot Mario Kart visuals aren't enough to get you to go out and buy a Wii U, and that's probably fair. Few games should ever really be considered \"system sellers,\" and another version of Mario Kart probably doesn't deserve such a qualification, no matter how solid that version may be. But if you do already own a Wii U, this is precisely the type of game you would have presumably bought the system for. It's Nintendo doing what Nintendo does, and doing it pretty well. With some games, that statement can have a damning quality, given how often Nintendo tends to play it safe with its major franchises. But I don't think it needs to apply to a game so frivolously entertaining as Mario Kart. It largely does what it needs to do, what you would <em>want</em> it to do, and does so with just enough distinction to make it stand out among the many other sequels in this series. Basically, Mario Kart 8 is some Mario Kart-ass-Mario Kart, and I think that's just fine.</p>", "deck": "Excellent new courses and spectacular visuals go a long way toward negating the sense of over-familiarity that comes part and parcel with all things Mario Kart.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-639/", "platforms": "Wii U", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42929/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mario-kart-8/3030-42929/", "id": 42929, "name": "Mario Kart 8"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-05-15 13:30:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-132979/", "id": 132979, "name": "Mario Kart 8"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tesla-effect-review/1900-642/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Nostalgia is a blessing and a curse.

The rest of the series--<a href=\"/martian-memorandum/3030-19081/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19081\">Martian Memorandum</a>, <a href=\"/under-a-killing-moon/3030-3177/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3177\">Under a Killing Moon</a>, <a href=\"/the-pandora-directive/3030-2619/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2619\">The Pandora Directive</a>--were made in the point-and-click style it's known for. Players assume the role of Tex Murphy, a dopey but surprisingly effective P.I. who constantly finds himself in the middle of death, intrigue, and global conspiracies. Under a Killing Moon is where I joined the series, and I have not-so-fond memories of calling the game's 900 tip line for hints, not knowing it was simultaneously charging my parents money. The game got me grounded. Overseer was to introduce Tex Murphy to DVDs, but ultimately the series ended on a cliffhanger about the fate of Tex and his longtime romance, <a href=\"/chelsee-bando/3005-11770/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11770\">Chelsee Bando</a>. Chelsee's fate has gone unresolved for 16 years, and in Tesla Effect, developer <a href=\"/big-finish-games-inc/3010-6760/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6760\">Big Finish Games</a> makes clear it has answers for fans that have been waiting.</p><p style=\"\">But first thing's first: the FMV. Boy, the FMV. Tesla Effect is loaded with FMV. The developers even filmed this in 4K. <em>YEAH</em>. That's how committed these people are to this lost art, and that element of Tex Murphy remains just as potent 16 years later. There are green screens all over the place, and I mean that in the best way possible. It embraces the shlock. If you're the kind of person who can derive pleasure from an evening spent with a SyFy film (one of the \"better\" ones, like <em>Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus</em>) and a pack of beer, Tex Murphy is right up your alley. Some of the special effects are shockingly decent, even! The amateur nature of the whole production--the green screen, the acting, the makeup--creates a genuinely handcrafted feel. Without copious FMV, it's not a Tex Murphy game. There's plenty to go around in Tesla Effect, and it's a warm, fuzzy feeling.</p><p style=\"\">The cheese may practically ooze out of the monitor, but like its predecessors, Tesla Effect doesn't pretend to be anything but a goofy good time. What continues to set Tex Murphy apart is its characters. The acting's bad, but the residents have a real charm to them. There's a heart beating in Chandler Avenue. It might be the nostalgia talking, but I don't root for the leads in most b-movies. By the end of Tesla Effect, I really wanted Tex to learn, for better or worse, what happened to Chelsee. The ending even pulled at my heart strings a little bit.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">In Tesla Effect, Tex has lost track of the last seven years. He wakes up with no memory of what's happened in nearly a decade, but he's apparently turned into a real jerk. His friends are happy to have the old Tex back, even if his last memory is the death of the love of his life. With a bump on his head, Tex sets out to figure out what he's been up to and where his memory went. Apparently it has something to do with inventor <a href=\"/nikola-tesla/3005-9322/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9322\">Nikola Tesla</a>.</p><p style=\"\">There are three phases to playing Tesla Effect: walking around the world and collecting items, talking to people, and solving puzzles. All three phases have tried to balance the look and feel of the old Tex Murphy games with the benefit of some modern design conveniences. This is where the game runs into trouble.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2634808-9410342686-Tesla.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2634808\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2634808-9410342686-Tesla.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2634808\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/9/93998/2634808-9410342686-Tesla.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You don't want to spend too much time looking at the game's 3D models. Unlike the FMV, it's not charmingly bad.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Pixel hunting is a trope of old school adventure games, one that's been mostly lost to glittery items pointing the way forward for players. Tesla Effect tries to have it both ways. Players are allowed to choose from two difficulty levels at the start of the game: casual and gamer. On casual, there's a built-in hint system to help guide players along (this drains from a ratings system, but one that has zero impact on the multiple endings) and pointing a flashlight will make interactive elements sparkle. Being a Tex Murphy fan, I went with the gamer option, figuring the developers have surely learned a thing or two since 1998. That's not really true.</p><p style=\"\">Though Tesla Effect does take place in a fully 3D environment, it largely remains a pixel hunt for very specific items needed to progress the story. This is less of a problem in the early hours of the game, since there are only so many locations to scour over and over again. This changes later in the story, as Tex is exploring multi-level environments. You know exactly what needs to be done (i.e. you need to find a key card) but have no idea where that key card might be. It could be hidden anywhere in two dozen dark rooms, but because I chose gamer mode, there's no way get the faintest hint. I would have switched to casual, but it's not possible. Instead, I did the modern equivalent of calling a 900 number: watching YouTube videos. This problem is exacerbated by inconsistencies in what objects Tex can interact with. Some drawers but not all drawers. Some doors but not all doors. Worst still, physical distance is a factor. More than once, I'd waltz back into a room, desperately seeking an item, only to realize I simply hadn't been close enough for the cursor to change into the \"open\" button. This only came up a handful of times throughout Tesla Effect, but it was just often enough to remind me why this type of game has changed so much. Inherent to the genre or bad design? Either way, it wasn't fun.</p><p style=\"\">And don't get me started on the few times when the game decides to incorporate AI-driven enemies into the mix, the point at which the game's modest production values clashed with its design ambitions in ways that had me looking for a drink. I've blocked these levels out of my memory, and I encourage you to finish them quickly.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2634809-teslaeffect-19-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2634809\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.45793650793651\" data-width=\"1260\" style=\"width: 1260px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2634809-teslaeffect-19-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2634809\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2634809-teslaeffect-19-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2634809-teslaeffect-19-1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tex's office is a mixture of new and old. Even in the future, he still gets faxes.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Chatting with folks is largely the same, though some of the changes made are curious. Conversations happen one of two ways, depending on whether it's about an investigation. If you're grilling characters, you choose from a a list of topics. Simple. During back-and-forths, you have dialogue options, but none really describe what Tex might say. \"Slapped and stunned,\" \"get acquainted,\" and \"optional equipment\" are the options in one such conversation--two of those are far too vague. The game would have benefited from being less cute about its descriptors and being more plain about the actual outcomes. It leads to frustrating situations where Tex doesn't act like the character you want him to be.</p><p style=\"\">Finally, the puzzles. Either you love them or hate them, but the puzzle design in Tesla Effect feels right in line with what the genre (and Tex Murphy) is known for. Many involve sliding blocks, lining up lasers, and generally shifting objects around until the solution is found. Besides being unable to reset a puzzle, I didn't have much of a problem with the puzzles themselves. Instead, it's how the game distributed those puzzles. Tesla Effect often ditches its story for more than an hour at a time, asking the player to solve puzzle after puzzle after puzzle. We're talking four or five rooms with puzzles back-to-back. The game flows best when players are rewarded for solving an obscurity with a new FMV sequence or story beat, but there are two lengthy areas in Tesla Effect, both towards the end, where Tex has zero interaction with anything but puzzles for lengthy stretches.</p><p style=\"\">But for every moment Tesla Effect had me cursing the '90s, another put a big, fat grin on my face. It's unapologetic about its roots, even when it probably shouldn't be. But I really enjoyed my evenings with the barely functional gumshoe, and it didn't destroy my memories of Tex Murphy in the process. Tesla Effect ends with the chance for more adventures with Tex Murphy, but if that never happens, it's okay.

First and foremost, it is yet another update of <a href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\">id Software</a>'s enduring <a href=\"/wolfenstein/3025-210/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-210\">Wolfenstein</a> franchise, a series mostly defined by its core concept of you shooting Nazis in the face. That's certainly one piece of The New Order, but developer <a href=\"/machinegames/3010-7331/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7331\">MachineGames</a> builds upon that core idea in several different ways. All the copious blood splatter and limb-exploding tech is joined by greater focuses on characterization, on pulpy sci-fi stylization, and, most importantly, on memorable storytelling. Which isn't to suggest that The New Order is successful in all of these areas. The New Order never quite settles on a consistent tone, nor does it often seem willing to afford its much-better-than-average characters enough time to really establish themselves to the player. It's a game that often feels like it's in a gigantic hurry to get the player to the next bout of Nazi killing, often at the expense of the character and world building the developers were clearly striving for. Yet The New Order mostly succeeds by virtue of how good the moments of character and world building you <em>do</em> get are, and by how rock solid the gameplay tends to be.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495240-row_charge.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495240\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.42489626556017\" data-width=\"2410\" style=\"width: 2410px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495240-row_charge.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495240\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/2840/2495240-row_charge.png\"></a><figcaption>Nazis need killin'? Time to call BJ Blazkowicz.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The New Order once again puts you in the blood-soaked boots of <a href=\"/bj-blazkowicz/3005-753/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-753\">William \"BJ\" Blazkowicz,</a> the lump of gun-holding meat that has starred in pretty much every version of Wolfenstein ever made. At the start, Blazkowicz finds himself in the middle of a D-Day-flavored raid on a massive Nazi compound...in 1946. In this game's timeline, World War II is still raging, and the Nazis have suddenly started surging across Europe thanks to a wealth of terrifying new technology. Blazkowicz and his band of brothers are sent to destroy the base occupied by the Nazi war machine's current leader, <a href=\"/wilhelm-strasse/3005-11687/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11687\">General Deathshead</a>. That mission goes terribly awry, and in the fallout, Blazkowicz is gravely injured by a piece of shrapnel that lodges itself in his skull. His living, but mostly comatose body is found and dropped off at a Polish insane asylum, where he spends the next 14 years in a vegetative state.</p><p style=\"\">Flash forward to 1960, and Blazkowicz suddenly finds himself called into action after the Nazis decide to close the asylum by killing all the patients (and the kindly family that runs the place, for good measure). Alive, but still at least partially broken, Blazkowicz quickly disposes of the assault team sent to the asylum, only to realize just how far down the world has fallen. The Nazis won the war, and their tendrils extend to nearly every corner of the globe. Every major city has been nuked and replaced with grotesque concrete monuments to the Nazis' many successes, and what little resistance still exists has mostly been cornered or captured. This places Blazkowicz, a character primarily defined by his ability to kill anything with a swastika emblazoned upon it with swift aplomb, into an unfamiliar, deeply uncomfortable situation. As written in The New Order, Blazkowicz is essentially an antiquated weapon that's been left out to rust for too long, suddenly thrust into a theater of war that initially appears beyond his capabilities.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's an interesting idea that, like too many ideas in The New Order, never feels fully explored. Blazkowicz comes with no shortage of gruff, brooding narration, in which he espouses half-formed ideas about this new world around him, how he fits into it, and what a life outside of war would even look like for someone like him. Most of this dialogue is actually kind of terrible, but the ideas they're built around are interesting, if rarely allowed much room to breathe. When Blazkowicz first awakes from his 14 years on the shelf, he's wobbly, out of sorts, and occasionally passes out for random bursts of time. Then, suddenly, he's mostly fine. What few instances we do get of him showing these sorts of symptoms are merely used as stylized segues for cutscenes. When it comes time for Nazi killin', Blazkowicz only ever falters when the player does. Instead of portraying him as the broken down war machine he's initially presented as, he mostly just operates as yet another all-too-capable first-person shooter protagonist. That's fine, I guess. It just feels like it betrays the more interesting concept of what the game apparently sees Blazkowicz as, versus what he actually is in practice.</p><p style=\"\">Blazkowicz's fellow freedom fighters are a far more interesting lot, which is why it's a bit of a shame that you don't get a great deal of time with those personalities during the main game. Standouts include the crippled Caroline Becker (who players of 2009's <a href=\"/wolfenstein/3030-21119/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21119\">Wolfenstein</a> will most likely remember), the reformed Nazi Klaus, his ultra-strong, Hodor-like companion, Max, as well as one of two soldiers you fight with in the game's opening battle. You'll actually have to make a choice as to which of the two die during the end of that first level, a choice that has ramifications on how the timeline plays out. Those ramifications essentially boil down to some different allies appearing during the course of the game, as well as a few minor mechanical changes, but just in concept, it's interesting notion that I wish MachineGames had gone a little further with.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495243-row_gunpoint.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495243\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.42489626556017\" data-width=\"2410\" style=\"width: 2410px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2495243-row_gunpoint.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495243\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/2840/2495243-row_gunpoint.png\"></a><figcaption>There are a number of memorable characters in The New Order, but few of them are given ample time to shine.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All of these characters have key roles to play in the main storyline, and some of those roles are pretty great. Unfortunately, the build-up to some of the best character moments is often lacking. Instead, most of your interactions during missions boil down to people telling you where to go and how to get there. The more interesting character stuff tends to fall into hurried cutscenes, quick bits of conversation while you walk around the rebel base between missions, and biographical information buried in the game's menus. At times, the script finds unexpected ways to make these characters seem like actual, genuine people, and at others, it seems to forget about them in favor of pushing you back into the action as quickly as possible. The actors who voice them do terrific work with the sometimes clumsy, overly expository dialogue they've been handed. In the few moments you are allowed to engage with these characters, you can see shades of <a href=\"/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay/3030-11085/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11085\">The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</a>, and <a href=\"/the-darkness/3030-9201/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9201\">The Darkness</a>, two games that the former <a href=\"/starbreeze-studios-ab/3010-1768/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1768\">Starbreeze</a> developers that founded MachineGames previously worked on. Those are games revered as much for their strong character work as they are for their richly detailed worlds and tight, brutal gameplay. The New Order feels like an earnest attempt to fashion Wolfenstein into something much like them.</p><p style=\"\">You especially get those Riddick/Darkness vibes when exploring The New Order's world. Though levels are generally more claustrophobic than in the Wolfensteins of old, there's ample reason to poke around where you can. Every environment is chock full of historical newspaper clippings, propaganda posters, hidden records (which feature Nazi Germany's take on pop hits of the era), and the like. Even just standing around and listening to conversations between other characters reveals more than you'd typically expect. The stuff you'll discover while exploring makes up for a lot of the details you'll miss if you only pay attention to the main story, and even if you don't feel like collecting, it's worth looking around just to take in the scenery. Granted, a lot of that scenery leans on the monochromatic and/or deeply depressing side. This is a harsh, fascist world built almost entirely out of concrete, after all, which doesn't leave a lot of room for variance in color schemes, nor visual splendor. Still, there are some memorable setpieces in The New Order and the overall look of the game is pretty great. It's not a visual powerhouse, but every environment feels distinctive, every character is nicely expressive, and the action runs at a mostly smooth clip on both the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a>.</p><p style=\"\">As good as its characters and levels are, there's a nagging issue that pops up all throughout The New Order, and it's one of tone. No, nothing about the game is especially offensive, unless you just don't like copious amounts of gore, harsh war imagery, or looking at anything related to Nazis in general. The issue is consistency, or a total lack thereof. The New Order is a game that simultaneously wants to be a dark, introspective look at the depths of human cruelty, and a crazy, over-the-top alternate historical sci-fi caper. In one mission, you will find yourself working undercover in a concentration camp, watching people get tortured, hiding under a pile of emaciated bodies headed for the incinerator, and witnessing other similarly disturbing things. Not long after, you're chuckling as you find yourself rocketing off to a Nazi base on the goddamn moon. When the game does decide to go dark, it usually handles the subject matter with decent enough care, and it's not as if the crazier sci-fi elements negatively impact the game. If anything, The New Order is at its best when it decides to get really ridiculous, as in the aforementioned moon base level, which is one of the best missions in the game. It's just that The New Order never quite finds a good balance between its sillier side and its darker aspirations, which leads to some jarring tonal shifts when it lurches from one side to the other. You're never quite sure if you're supposed to be affected by the direness of the situation or just grinning at the insanity of it all.</p><p style=\"\">It's forgivable if you opt for the latter. As much as The New Order strives toward emotional connection with the player, it's often at its best when it just decides to be a frenetic shooter. The New Order offers up no shortage of opportunities to kill lots and lots of bad guys, though how you choose to do so is surprisingly open-ended. If you're of an old school mentality, simply double-fisting two giant guns and blowing everything in your path into a cloud of blood and viscera is a completely sensible and satisfying way to go about things. Sometimes that's also a very difficult way of going about things, as alerting every nearby enemy to your presence often leads to a quick, brutal death. In combat mode, enemy AI is pretty sharp, meaning enemies will actually work together to try and flush you out if you're hiding behind cover. Sometimes, it's better to take a stealthy route. I know, I know, what is stealth even doing in a game like Wolfenstein? You'll be forgiven for assuming stealth mechanics in a game like this would be terrible, but they actually aren't. Whether you're using a silenced pistol or just a trusty knife, there's ample opportunity to sneak around and kill enemies without ever being spotted, and the game is surprisingly well designed for this kind of tactic. This is especially useful when dealing with commanders, who have the ability to summon reinforcements as soon as you're spotted. Enemy AI is a bit more, shall we say, <em>generous,</em> when they're not aware you're around, so it's completely viable to sneak your way through multiple sections of The New Order, and it's surprisingly fun to do so.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/2535352-1239125_10151785196734166_1438165314_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2535352\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.42484076433121\" data-width=\"3140\" style=\"width: 3140px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/112064/2535352-1239125_10151785196734166_1438165314_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2535352\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/11/112064/2535352-1239125_10151785196734166_1438165314_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/11/112064/2535352-1239125_10151785196734166_1438165314_o.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The action in The New Order is often exciting, even if the weapon variety isn't.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">And if you don't, again, you can just shoot everything to death all the time. Sometimes I very much did, especially in The New Order's bigger, crazier levels. When you're in an intense firefight with a dozen or so enemies all bearing down on you, the chaos that results is both harrowing and highly entertaining. The only real letdown of the gunplay pertains to the weapons you're given. I never really fell in love with any of the guns in the game. Some, like the automatic shotgun, or the multipurpose laser cutter, can lead to some pretty spectacular deaths, and the shooting in general has a good, solid feel to it. I just kind of wish the weapons had been a little more out-there, I suppose. Considering how insane this retro-futuristic world is, with its speculative technologies and horrible death robots and whatnot, it's surprising to me that the guns you're given feel so utterly familiar. It's another case where the game tries to strike a balance between the realistic and the insane, and as a result, most of the guns just seem like slightly more futuristic versions of the same sorts of guns you'd find in any first-person shooter. The destruction that results from their use is certainly fun to watch unfold, though.</p><p style=\"\">Giving credit where credit's due, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a great deal more ambitious than you would ever expect yet another Wolfenstein reboot to be. This is a game that could have easily just slapped another quick-and-dirty Nazi invasion plot together and leaned entirely on the shooting of things to get by. Instead, MachineGames has obviously gone to great lengths to turn The New Order into something more than that. It tries to create stakes that go beyond the basic scope of \"kill those bad guys because they're bad,\" and even when it fails to completely take advantage of those stakes, there's still enough excitement, enough intrigue, enough humanity in its story to keep you interested. Even if its ideas only scratch the surface of something deeper, Wolfenstein: The New Order still delivers an experience well worth your time.</p>", "deck": "Wolfenstein: The New Order is smarter than a game called Wolfenstein probably has any right to be, yet it still manages to capture the hyperviolent spirit of its predecessors.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-643/", "platforms": "Xbox One, PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42581/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wolfenstein-the-new-order/3030-42581/", "id": 42581, "name": "Wolfenstein: The New Order"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-05-21 13:40:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-133040/", "id": 133040, "name": "Wolfenstein: The New Order"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/watch-dogs-review/1900-644/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2481409-watchdogs_takedown+cop+droppingdoor.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2481409\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2481409-watchdogs_takedown+cop+droppingdoor.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2481409\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2481409-watchdogs_takedown+cop+droppingdoor.png\"></a><figcaption>You can close doors on the cops, but they seem to open them really quickly.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">For better or worse, <a href=\"/watch-dogs/3030-38538/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38538\">Watch Dogs</a> has been propped up by many as one of the new generation of consoles' first \"big\" games. But instead of feeling like the future, Watch Dogs reminds me of the past. I'm reminded of the time when developers were ardently chasing after that <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\">Grand Theft Auto</a> gold, resulting in a menagerie of takes on the GTA formula, each with their own little hook. Some worked out really well, others floundered and vanished. Watch Dogs' spin on the genre gives you limited control over some of the city's features, letting you toggle the state of various objects both on foot or in a vehicle. For the most part, these interactions are there to eliminate or block your enemies so you have more time to escape. Even with that as one of its unique twists on the genre, Watch Dogs is little clunky in spots and it starts very slowly. Luckily, that bad first impression lets up as you get into more interesting missions and become more comfortable with the game's abilities and options.</p><p style=\"\">In a lot of ways, Watch Dogs falls into the same routine as most other mission-based open-world games. There's a main narrative of missions that progress in order, with side missions that back them up and give you a little something to do if you're looking for a change. The mission design is really standard for this sort of game--you'll hunt people down and shoot them, you'll get away from the <a href=\"/police/3015-1011/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1011\">cops</a>, and the missions where you're asked to tail someone discreetly continue to suck. I don't necessarily view all this as a bad thing, but at this point in life you've probably already determined whether or not you like this sort of game. Not to get overly reflexive on you, but if you have the hunger for this type of open-world game, it's a solid entry. The things designed to set Watch Dogs apart, though, don't make that big of an impact.</p><p style=\"\">The first differentiator is that you're a hacker set loose in a city that's been overrun by surveillance and connected \"smart\" technologies that are designed to make life easier (while simultaneously setting up the game's slightly hamfisted approach to the issues of government surveillance and the potential nightmares that come from relying on one big system with a single point of failure). For the most part, this boils down to pushing the square button to incapacitate police cars. Sometimes that square button raises blockers out of the street, sometimes it causes steam pipes to explode, but generally, you're waiting for a \"neutralize\" prompt to appear on-screen while you're driving, indicating that you're a button press away from having one less hassle on your tail. You also use that square button (X on the Xbox, naturally) to hack the planet.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2481406-watchdogs_clara.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2481406\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2481406-watchdogs_clara.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2481406\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2481406-watchdogs_clara.png\"></a><figcaption>A few characters drop in to help or hurt your cause.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">When pressed, that square button sends you into profiler mode, allowing you to view names and details of any of the game's NPCs. Some of them have bank accounts you can hack, letting you get access to funds that are useful for buying a few weapons, but generally useless unless you're into cosmetic stuff like costumes or unlocking additional cars. Others have songs you can hack out of their phones, adding them to the game's disjointed and disappointing playlist. You hit this button when you walk up to terminals or see junction boxes on the street, and you can also use it to tap into security camera feeds. It's a one-size-fits-all approach to hacking, which makes the way the game occasionally and arbitrarily sticks in a dull hacking minigame feel that much more puzzling. A big part of the game involves hacking into a camera, then using that to hack into another camera, and so on and so on until you get to an otherwise-unreachable hacking point. You can also tag enemies with the profiler or security cameras, letting you see silhouettes behind walls and setting up the game's various stealth takedowns.</p><p style=\"\">Interestingly, the game has no \"real\" melee combat system. Rather than giving you a punch button, the game simply has a takedown button, and it works whether you're sneaking up from behind or running up in plain sight. You also have weapons, including a perfectly accurate and silenced pistol that, except in cases where you're severely outnumbered and forced into open combat, makes most of the combat and stealth situations feel completely trivial, assuming you're even slightly skilled at lining up headshots. When taking on scads of enemies, the assault rifles work just fine and, as long as you patiently use cover and don't expose yourself for too long, the combat is quite easy.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The other thing that sets Watch Dogs apart from the typical open-world game is the way its online action is structured. While it still has the same boring online race mode that every open-world game seems to have these days (does anyone actually still want to engage in an open-world race in a game that wasn't built for racing?), it also has a handful of cat-and-mouse-like modes where one player has to get close to another player to steal something from them. These online invasions pop up against your will, forcing you to deal with another player before you can proceed. The rewards for succeeding in this mode are minimal and they seem to always pop up when you're trying to start another mission, making them feel like a hassle that's preventing you from doing the thing you actually want to be doing. It seems like a bad implementation of a decent idea. If you like, you can disable the online invasion aspect of the game, but doing so prevents you from earning a handful of bonus perks, like making your bullets do more damage to vehicles. Disabling invasions mid-game actually resets any online points you've earned back to zero, too. This would be a little more outrageous if the perks you got for playing online were of any real value, but many of them pertain solely to the multiplayer mode that you're trying to avoid and the game is already quite easy, so it's not that big of a deal. There are a handful of different modes that you can engage from a separate menu, and the game will <em>constantly</em> remind you that various online opportunities exist via the same system it uses to notify you about nearby side missions.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2481408-watchdogs_potential_victim.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2481408\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2481408-watchdogs_potential_victim.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2481408\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2481408-watchdogs_potential_victim.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2481408-watchdogs_potential_victim.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the side missions has you profiling potential criminals and stopping altercations before they can get started.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The story puts you in the shoes of a thief-turned-vigilante who sees the light in the game's opening moments, after a cyber-caper goes cyber-sideways resulting in some decidedly non-cyber-retaliation that ends with your all-the-way-not-cyber niece dead. Watch Dogs is a revenge tale, as <a href=\"/aiden-pearce/3005-23427/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23427\">Aiden Pearce</a> attempts to find out who ordered the hit on him that left his niece dead while also hooking up with some other shady hackers and fighting crime. With his gruff voice and serious demeanor, you almost half-expect a mid-game twist where Pearce just shouts \"I'm cyber-<a href=\"/batman/3005-66/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-66\">Batman</a>.\" Instead, he's out there using his real name--which, considering most of the game's other hackers appear with embarrassing monikers like Badboy17 or Defalt, might be the smartest thing Pearce does in the entire game. Or maybe \"Aiden Pearce\" is just as embarrassing of a name. Anyway, the story is all over the place and is full of characters that sort of cruise into and out of the story, which makes it hard to care about any of them. Also, the main missions have huge sidetracks that occasionally feel like they came from another game--a couple of times I completely forgot why I was even doing what I was doing and how my current mission tied into the overall picture of getting revenge for my dead niece.</p><p style=\"\">I found myself avoiding the soundtrack in Watch Dogs, instead going for the sounds of <a href=\"/chicago/3035-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-293\">Chicago</a>'s streets and the occasional forced, in-mission music. The licensed music appears in a playlist format that you can configure to your liking. This makes sense, as this is how people actually listen to music these days, but losing the radio format that many other open-world games use makes the city feel a little more lifeless. It attempts to inject some of your exploits into the audio by forcing the occasional news report on you, but this makes even less sense... is the news so important that it's breaking into whatever playlist I keep on my phone to tell me about it or something? Also, having playlist controls in a game only to occasionally force you into specific songs for missions and also not allowing custom soundtracks seems kind of lame. Are we supposed to believe that Aiden Pearce actually likes all of the music on his playlists? Sorry, this is actually a super minor point, but one I became sort of obsessed with every time I tried to change the music only to have it say \"media player unavailable.\" What, does Aiden's phone detect when he's on an important mission and play appropriate music instead of whatever cheaply licensed pop-punk Ubisoft decided to cram onto the soundtrack? When used wisely, a licensed soundtrack can be an almost living part of your story. Here it feels like something thrown in as an obligation.</p><p style=\"\">Visually, Watch Dogs looks good on <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a>, with a usually stable frame rate, a good draw distance, and all that. No one part of it stands out as amazing or revolutionary (though the water looks pretty nice). Instead it's merely higher fidelity than the games and consoles that came before it. The visual implementation of hacking is pretty good at making the HUD and information you learn about nearby civilians seem like it's coming in via some kind of <a href=\"/augmented-reality/3015-3225/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3225\">augmented reality</a> setup--which actually makes the whole game feel weirdly dated, since Pearce spends much of the game staring down at his phone like a bored kid trying to ignore his parents. Given that we live in an era where people are out there paying way-too-much money for Google Glass and anticipating other head-mounted setups, going phone-only (and all the hilarious animations that come along with a man holding a pistol in one hand and a phone in the other) seems out of touch for a game that's trying to represent the dark future of technology. That dark future is <em>already here</em>, and Watch Dogs gets that wrong.</p><p style=\"\">Even though I feel its story is often weak and its action isn't that different from other games in the genre, I still enjoyed my time with Watch Dogs. It turns out that the old stuff still works, and the strong-but-standard mission design kept me entertained, most of the time. It's rough around the edges, though, so if you don't settle for anything less than the best, you'll probably be disappointed.</p><p style=\"\">But hey, Watch Dogs 2? <em>That'll</em> probably be pretty cool.</p>", "deck": "Watch Dogs is a solid open-world game that doesn't do enough to set itself apart from the pack.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-644/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-38538/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/watch-dogs/3030-38538/", "id": 38538, "name": "Watch Dogs"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2014-05-27 00:01:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-125485/", "id": 125485, "name": "Watch Dogs"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/shovel-knight-review/1900-645/", "description": "<p style=\"\">How I feel about today's shooters is probably how others feel about the deluge of nostalgia-influenced platformers.

In a good way.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Shovel Knight has a story insofar as any of these games have a surface-level justification for what's happening. Shovel Knight and Shield Knight have long protected the realm, but the world is soon corrupted by The Order of No Quarter (which just might be the best name for a group of enemies since...well, forever), lead by The Enchantress. Shovel Knight is separated from Shield Knight, and it's up to Shovel Knight to start digging to victory. In practical terms, this means players are running around as Shovel Knight, and occasionally navigating an overworld map that gives limited agency over which major enemy you'll tackle next.</p><p style=\"\">The problem with many of these kinds of games is they're often unsure which master to serve, and get caught up praying at the altar of the past. Shovel Knight could not exist without the 8-bit classics, sure, but it's not explicitly beholden to its conventions, either. It's a decidedly modern game leveraging gaming's history as a starting point. It's a means to an end, not the end itself. That's where so many of these games get it wrong.</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/ducktales/3030-15799/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15799\">DuckTales </a>and <a href=\"/mega-man/3025-523/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\">Mega Man</a> fans will feel right at home with Shovel Knight. The character's weapon--yes, a shovel--is used to attack enemies, destroy objects, and bounce on stuff. Most of Shovel Knight's attacks, even when he begins acquiring magical relics in each stage, require him to get very close to obstacles in his path. With rare exceptions, Shovel Knight is incapable of standing on the other side of the screen and slowly clearing a path forward. Being able to pogo stick on top of enemies gives players flexibility in their tactics, allowing them to play a cautious form of offense that provides room to breathe. Understanding the physics of one's shovel-assisted jumps is crucial to finding the game's myriad secrets, as well. Most are hidden behind both marked and unmarked walls that must be destroyed, and others require deviously timed jumps that let you cover great distances, both horizontally and vertically, that would be impossible otherwise.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The secrets are half the fun in Shovel Knight, too. They're everywhere, making every screen more than just a set of hazards to navigate. The secrets often contain plentiful treasure, the currency used to purchase upgrades for Shovel Knight. Both health and mana upgrades are available in limited quantities, in addition to armor with certain bonuses (i.e. dropping less treasure after dying) and new shovel attacks (i.e. shooting a ground-level fireball while at full health). Shovel Knight can acquire a host of magical abilities, as well, which can be purchased by finding a vendor within a level or completing the stage and finding that same vendor back in town. Unlike Mega Man, weapons aren't explicitly linked to bosses, even though stages are themed around the last encounter.</p><p style=\"\">Part of what makes Shovel Knight stand out is what doesn't stand out. The controls feel <em>right</em>. While playing, the character always landed where I wanted him to. The controls are tight, responsive, and do exactly what you want. That may sound simple, but without this, Shovel Knight wouldn't work. We often focus on games that get this wrong, not games that get it right. When it feels right, you don't notice it. That means the developer nailed it.

The delightful idle animations for the world's many characters, an elaborate dance sequence by a giant fish for no reason, the discovery of a hidden boss in a room full of hats, using a fishing rod to find off-screen treasure. These touches extend beyond the caretakers of the game's visuals, too. For example, you can jump higher than what the game is currently showing on the screen at any time. If you're at the top of the screen during a forced scrolling sequence, your head doesn't butt up against an invisible barrier. You can actually leap into the blackness of the UI. It's a small touch, but one that actually proves useful.</p><p style=\"\">That said, there was a cocktail of emotions when the credits rolled on Shovel Knight. I was upset the game had come to an end, since I'm now left waiting for the hopefully inevitable sequel. But I wondered if Shovel Knight played it too safe. One cannot speak of games gone by without acknowledging how brutally difficult they were. If you, like me, were a kid granted one, precious game every few months, you milked those games for all they were worth. One reason that worked was because the games were so god damned hard. (My mom actually called a customer support line to complain after my brother and I finished <a href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iv-turtles-in-time/3030-18034/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18034\">Turtles in Time</a> in two hours.) The challenge wasn't always earned, and often it was cheap, but you had to legitimately cross the finish line.</p><p style=\"\">That's not the case in Shovel Knight, an especially easy game by classic standards. I died a handful of times, a few spots gave me some real trouble, but I wouldn't call Shovel Knight hard. It's a very accessible platformer for its type, which might come as a disappointment to some. Rather than embrace this facet of its influences, Shovel Knight asks players to accomplish other forms of herculean tasks, such as finishing the game without dying or health upgrades. For some, that will prove a worthy goal to chase, a reason to spend potentially hundreds of hours with Shovel Knight. But not for me. I wanted the game to ask more of me upfront, as I'm far less interested in masochistic challenges (the game's achievements are called \"feats\") layered on top of the game. Instead, I breezed right through Shovel Knight, and was left wishing the game had pushed me much, much harder.</p><p style=\"\">My questions about the game's difficulty wouldn't matter if were talking about a lesser game, though. I simply wanted to love Shovel Knight even more than I already do. Shovel Knight is an exceptionally well-made action platformer, one worthy of being celebrated far beyond the nostalgic foundation it's built upon. Shovel Knight won't be the last old school game made in the modern age, but it's unlikely many others will be as much fun.</p>", "deck": "Many games try to use nostalgia to lure you in, but few of them are as well-made as Shovel Knight.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-645/", "platforms": "Wii U, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42034/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/shovel-knight/3030-42034/", "id": 42034, "name": "Shovel Knight"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-06-26 17:58:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-132619/", "id": 132619, "name": "Shovel Knight"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review/1900-646/", "description": "<p style=\"\">A video game about war is perhaps the least novel thing you could create in our medium today, which is one reason why <a href=\"/valiant-hearts-the-great-war/3030-43885/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43885\">Valiant Hearts: The Great War</a> is such a surprising thing. Developed by <a href=\"/ubisoft-montpellier-studios/3010-3911/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3911\">Ubisoft Montpellier</a>, Valiant Hearts examines the aspects of war that are most often brushed past or ignored altogether in games. This is a game concerned with the human element of war, the stories of the people forced to fight in these terrible conflicts, the people displaced by violence, and the relationships that keep them going in the face of terrible hardship. In some respects, it's a clumsy effort. Its narrative relies too heavily on situational convenience and generic villainy at times, and its gameplay is rarely the best thing about it. Yet Valiant Hearts remains compelling throughout its half-dozen hours, thanks in no small part to its deft handling of the many emotional highs and lows that make up its small, but wonderful tale.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2652390-valiant-hearts-the-great-war-comeback-trailer_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2652390\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2652390-valiant-hearts-the-great-war-comeback-trailer_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2652390\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2652390-valiant-hearts-the-great-war-comeback-trailer_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Whether you're a history buff or just want a good story, Valiant Hearts delivers in surprising ways.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Set against the backdrop of <a href=\"/world-war-i/3015-2189/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2189\">World War I</a>'s western front, Valiant Hearts tells the story of four people whose lives are gravely affected by the conflict. Karl is a young, German-born man living in France when the war begins, and despite his protestations, he's sent from his home back to Germany, forced to fight for a nation he no longer calls home. Emile, Karl's father-in-law, is forced to take up arms for his home nation of France. Elsewhere we also meet Freddie, a burly American motivated to fight largely by personal vengeance, and Anna, a Belgian medic who moves from battle to battle doing whatever she can to patch up the wounded.</p><p style=\"\">These four protagonists (along with a trusty dog who helps out from time to time) find themselves floating in and out of each other's lives, reuniting during various battles, only to be torn away from one another by one horrible circumstance or another. At times the plot strains itself to find ways to bring these four people together, given that they're often spread across such a massive battleground. But those moments of plot convenience are forgivable by virtue of how endearing these characters are. Their stories are fleshed out primarily from collectible diary entries, but they also communicate a great deal wordlessly. Apart from a few bouts of narration and some language-specific grunting, there is little dialogue in Valiant Hearts. Instead, the game's visuals are tasked with doing the heavy lifting here. Every moment of pain, sacrifice, and (occasionally) joy is communicated using the game's comic book-inspired artwork, and it works surprisingly well.</p><p style=\"\">It's not just that Valiant Hearts is a beautiful looking game (it is), but rather that its art is used so effectively to communicate to the player. It's in each character's facial expressions, and the small environmental details, that the game's emotional resonance lives. Valiant Hearts is expressive in a way that big studio games often aren't, relying on a subtlety of delivery that implies a trust in its players to empathize with its heroes, despite spelling out only the most basic details about each of them. It never yells to the player about what they're supposed to be feeling; it never shouts about much of anything, actually. There are certainly big, sweeping moments of action within the game, but they're dwarfed in number by the scenes focused on individual characters and the horrors continually befalling them.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2652388-vh_sc_4_emile_trenches.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2652388\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2652388-vh_sc_4_emile_trenches.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2652388\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2652388-vh_sc_4_emile_trenches.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can press a button to pet the dog any time you like. I pressed that button a lot. Like, A LOT.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's worth noting that Valiant Hearts isn't looking to be an especially \"realistic\" portrayal of World War I. The game pulls no punches when portraying the grotesqueries of the battlefield--moments where you'll find yourself running through hails of machine gun fire, climbing over the bodies of your fallen comrades, are frequent--but the overall tone of the game is a bit lighter than its subject matter lets on. Take, for instance, the near-total lack of combat in the game. In the rare instance that you do have to fight an enemy soldier, you're never handed a gun and asked to shoot anybody (outside of a lone tank sequence where you blast away enemy artillery and swooping fighter planes). Instead, Emile just conks enemies on the head with a wooden spoon, a nod to his role as a military cook during one period of the war, while other characters never attack at all. Another example is a pair of quickly paced chase sequences. Here you take control of a sputtering cab that mostly propels itself, while you simply dodge and weave between enemy fire and other obstacles while classical music accompanies the rhythms of the action. It's goofy stuff that would, on paper at least, seem wildly out of place in a game so seemingly dour in tone, but somehow Valiant Hearts pulls it off without coming across as jarring or distracting.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The only time Valiant Hearts really lost me was when it opted to drum up some artificial conflict. So much of the game is about the kind of faceless evil that makes up war, the constant charging into certain death against an enemy you know almost nothing about. That changes after a point, when an evil Baron from the German side starts appearing just to put a face to what you're fighting against. He's a pointless character, a twirling mustache there to sneer and drop bombs on you when the gameplay demands a more specific threat, and it's the only part of the game that feels out of place. How the game chooses to pay off the Baron's plotline is ultimately of little consequence to the bigger, more interesting stories at play, which makes his inclusion seem all the weirder.</p><p style=\"\">Valiant Hearts also lost my attention during a few particular gameplay sequences. All of Valiant Hearts' campaign consists of lightweight puzzle solving, peppered with the aforementioned minor combat bits and even some light rhythm gaming. In each stage, you are presented with some maze of problems to solve--an injured civilian is trapped behind a pile of debris you must navigate your way to, a prison camp can only be escaped after you perform tasks for various people, a detonator must be found and recovered before you can blow up a German fortress, and the like. These simple navigation puzzles are rarely of the sort that will stump any experienced player, but there's mostly just enough challenge there to keep you from feeling like you're just mindlessly doing chores before getting to the next story beat. Mostly. A few stages are outright dull, while others seem like neat ideas that never feel fully fleshed out--the minigame that accompanies Anna's patching up of injured folk is particularly pointless. Even when the puzzles are better, Valiant Hearts is never particularly thrilling. Given its more contemplative tone, that's not surprising, but it does highlight the challenge of trying to turn something so decidedly graphic novel-like into a game. While Valiant Hearts has numerous poignant moments, few of those are during the most interactive portions of the game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/17/171291/2544483-8713744914-36336.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2544483\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/17/171291/2544483-8713744914-36336.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2544483\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/17/171291/2544483-8713744914-36336.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/17/171291/2544483-8713744914-36336.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Its gameplay is fairly mundane, but it serves the story the game is trying to tell. And that story is very much worth seeing through to the end.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Fortunately, one of those few great interactive moments closes out Valiant Hearts, demonstrating definitively that there was value in turning this story into a game after all. It's a simple thing, something you won't even realize until the consequences are staring you right in the face, and it serves as a perfectly heartrending conclusion to a sad, but beautiful little story. Sometimes the most important thing a game can do is just stick the landing, and Valiant Hearts does exactly that.</p><p style=\"\">Valiant Hearts isn't going to challenge many players' abilities, but it may challenge any preconceived notions about how video games are meant to tackle subjects like war. There are certainly faults to be found with its underlying game design, but in a game that cares this much for its own characters--arguably as much as it cares about the history of the war itself, which is quite a lot--I found it difficult to get hung up on the occasional uninteresting fetch quest or rhythmic minigame. Its rewards are far more emotional in nature, the kind you find in any good story, regardless of medium. Seek this one out, and see it through to its conclusion. It's worth it.</p>", "deck": "Ubisoft Montpellier's take on the first World War is a surprisingly heartfelt adventure.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-646/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-43885/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/valiant-hearts-the-great-war/3030-43885/", "id": 43885, "name": "Valiant Hearts: The Great War"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-07-02 13:30:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-132723/", "id": 132723, "name": "Valiant Hearts: The Great War"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-r/1900-647/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2671942-d3_x1_ps4_co_op_ad_14_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2671942\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2671942-d3_x1_ps4_co_op_ad_14_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2671942\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/26/2671942-d3_x1_ps4_co_op_ad_14_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's handy to have another warm body around, if only to soak up some of the damage heading your way.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/diablo-iii/3030-20803/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\">Diablo III</a> has changed quite a bit in the two years since its initial release. Things like \"<a href=\"/articles/diablo-iii-to-feature-real-money-auction-house-for/1100-3538/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-3538\">real money auction houses</a>\" came and went, the loot system got redesigned, and an expansion was released along with a new adventure mode that gives you a new way to grind through the game without having to see the story beats time and time again. An exciting action-RPG got better and reinvigorated by that work. Now it's all bundled up into one pack for consoles. This \"Ultimate Evil Edition\" is a fine version of the game with effective adjustments that make the game just about as playable with a controller as it is with a mouse and keyboard.</p><p style=\"\">The key to all that, of course, is direct character control. As opposed to left-clicking your way around the world, this console version of Diablo III simply lets you walk around using the left analog stick. It's a big difference, but one that still feels natural, especially if you were raised on console games like <a href=\"/baldurs-gate-dark-alliance/3030-13091/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13091\">Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance</a>. The right stick is used for a exclusive-to-consoles roll move that gives you a bit of mobility, but it never feels especially crucial. Of course, the rest of the controls have also been adapted to fit a controller, so you'll eventually have like six abilities mapped to different buttons on the controller. You can swap those abilities around however you like, which either means that you'll be able to find a setup that feels natural for you or you'll constantly be confused about which button does what, depending on what type of player you are. It all works just fine.</p><p style=\"\">The game's interface and menus have also had to be rebuilt for controllers and living rooms, meaning there's a ton of big-ass text in the menus. The equipment and skills sections are built with radial menus, making it fairly easy to get around and check out different item types. The arrows on each item make it easy to see, in a basic sense, if an item is going to help you out or not. And there's a junk system in place to make it easy to flag the stuff that you want to sell or salvage next time you're back in town. It took me an hour or two to get used to each system, since each one feels like it's about one or two button presses too many, but once I became familiar with how Diablo III handles things, it eventually became second nature. Still, having to button deep into menus to dig into the numbers and real stats on an item is kind of a pain, and it's the one spot where I missed the PC's relative elegance.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2671937-d3_x1_ps4_actv_bountymap_ad_01_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2671937\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2671937-d3_x1_ps4_actv_bountymap_ad_01_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2671937\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2671937-d3_x1_ps4_actv_bountymap_ad_01_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Adventure mode lets you chop up the world into bite-sized chunks.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Beyond that, this is Diablo III with the Reaper of Souls expansion included. The story is a little boneheaded but largely stays out of the way, giving you hours and hours of satisfying action-RPG combat and interesting abilities to choose from as you devise numerous ways to blow up skeletons, demons, shambling tree men, evil goat men, devils, fallen angels, zombies, vomiting zombies, barrels, tables, and whatever the hell else happens to be around your character when things start jumping off. The destructible set dressing strewn across Diablo's dungeons ended up being one of my favorite visuals in the entire game--as you begin combat, anything that isn't bolted down just seems to get blown up during the ensuing fray.</p><p style=\"\">One thing I'll say about the way this Ultimate Evil Edition is packaged is that the game doesn't do a great job of transitioning you from the main campaign into what used to be expansion content. Reaper of Souls exists as a fifth act to the main game, so once you beat the main game's final boss, rather than get any sense of meaningful closure you're just thrust into the next area after a couple of cinematics. Without the context that Act V is separate from the rest, the transition feels disjointed and rough. Also, the game has a closing cinematic, but since it's the closing cinematic for the expansion, it doesn't really feel like it has enough of a meaningful impact. It goes out with a whimper, not a bang, complete with a dialogue window that pops up after beating the final boss that pretty much says \"push X to go to the main menu.\" It makes an already ignorable story feel even flimsier.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That's why it'd be great if you could just hop into adventure mode without beating the game's story first. Adventure mode lets you skip around the game at will and take on an endless series of bounties set across the same landscapes used in story mode. Most of them are relatively short, so if you have an hour or two, you could complete a set of five bounties and be on your way. It's a great way to segment the game into smaller, more manageable chunks, if that's your thing. The endgame mode also allows you to explore various \"rifts,\" which are separate areas that throw enemies together in new configurations and help ensure that you've always got something to do, whether you're grinding up to level 70 or taking it beyond the maximum level with the game's paragon system, allowing you to further build up max level characters. There are also 10 different difficulty settings. Do yourself a favor and start on hard, as a minimum, and don't be afraid to creep up to something higher if you're getting bored. The difficulties are really misnamed--hard most definitely isn't \"hard.\"</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2671950-d3_x1_ps4_expert_ad_01_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2671950\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2671950-d3_x1_ps4_expert_ad_01_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2671950\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2671950-d3_x1_ps4_expert_ad_01_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2671950-d3_x1_ps4_expert_ad_01_tga_jpgcopy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Feel free to work your way up the difficulty tree, the names sound scarier than they actually are.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game looks fine on the PS4, roughly in line with what you'd expect out of the PC version at 1080p, though the frame rate would pop and hitch on occasion, usually when large enemies are in the process of blowing up and spitting loot all over the ground.

Original Sin marks the third installment in the mainline Divinity franchise, and serves as a welcoming gateway into a genre only recently making a comeback.</p><p style=\"\">(For reference, CRPG refers to computer role-playing games in the lineage of <a href=\"/baldurs-gate/3030-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-52\">Baldur's Gate</a>, <a href=\"/icewind-dale/3030-5242/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5242\">Icewind Dale</a>, and others.)</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2673016-7655408058-Image.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2673016\" style=\"width: 1422px\" data-ratio=\"0.55977496483826\" data-width=\"1422\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2673016-7655408058-Image.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2673016\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2673016-7655408058-Image.png\"></a><figcaption>I really enjoyed this game, despite the presence of a quest line involving giant spiders.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Divinity's world is one of god, men, orcs, magic--typical fantasy stuff. Players are asked to build two characters from scratch--male, female, doesn't matter--who become the leads, Source hunters looking to solve a murder. Source is a dangerously powerful form of magic long since banned for its corrupting nature. That's why you're Source <em>hunters</em>. Anyone found messing with Source is to be eliminated with extreme prejudice. Of course, it wouldn't be a video game if the world didn't come to an end at some point, so it doesn't take very long for Divinity to rope its characters into a near-certain apocalypse.</p><p style=\"\">In the first hour, Divinity lays out its gameplay beats. Players click a customized party of warriors, thieves, and mages across a beautiful but violent world, seamlessly shifting between exploration, conversation, and combat. Though Divinity does a serviceable job of explaining its high-level concepts, it does not hold your hand and make sure you're ready to play. Divinity throws you into the deep end. Some players will love that; it's not common these days. Those lovers are, most likely, already fans of the genre. It's not uncommon to hear reports of players investing hours into Divinity, realizing they've built their characters wrong, and starting from scratch. It's easy to goof stat upgrades, and you only level every few hours. Those stories almost scared me off from even trying the game, so I kept <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/tips-for-playing-divinity-original-sin-1601825219\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">a guide from Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton</a> open on my iPad for the first dozen hours. It quickly became my personal bible, a cherished friend. It might not have been the purest experience, but it helped me get my feet wet, and I eventually moved forward with confidence, and crafted my own experience.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Though Divinity has a story, this game's all about combat. I've played turn-based games before, but few offer the seemingly limitless strategic freedom found in any single combat encounter. It doesn't take long to grasp the familiar mechanics. Characters have a set number of action points that regenerate each turn, and any movement, spell, or attack requires spending those points. Players and enemies swap turns, and it's always clear who's next, since it's listed at the top of the screen. What makes Divinity unique is a discrete focus on base elements. In Divinity's world, that's earth, air, fire, and water. Each of these elements play off and interact with one another, and learning those dynamics is critical to longterm success. If you dump oil on the ground, you can light it on fire, which can light enemies on fire, and burn them for several rounds. If you cause a rainstorm, that generates puddles on the map, which are susceptible to lightning strikes, and those are suddenly stun traps. The list goes on, and options expand as more party members join the group. Most battles conclude with your surroundings looking like a scorched wasteland, the ground littered with tasty loot.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">My crew consisted of Roland, a ranger focused on distance attacks with elementally-tinted arrows; Susannah, a mage with earth and fire spells; Jahan, a mage with air and water spells; and Madora, a walking tank carrying an axe. We were a wrecking crew by the end. Ahead of combat, Susannah would sprinkle the ground with oil. Then, Roland would fire a charm arrow at the most powerful enemy, temporarily turning our greatest enemy into a terrifying ally. Not long after, Susannah would drop a massive boulder from the heavens, one that both ignited the oil and poisoned anyone nearby. Before anyone could recover, Jahan had summoned an ice elemental to begin freezing those still standing. Finally, Madora would lumber forward and take out anyone stupid enough to stick around. After this destructive blow-by-blow, the enemies would get a chance to fight. <em>Chance</em>. I'm getting teary eyed thinking about it. That's just my strategy, though. There are countless others, as characters don't have to fit into established archetypes, party members can learn every type of magic (I never even touched witchcraft!), and battles will often begin with enemies specifically designed to force you in a different direction.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2673017-6468914824-Image.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2673017\" style=\"width: 1421px\" data-ratio=\"0.56298381421534\" data-width=\"1421\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2673017-6468914824-Image.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2673017\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/9/93998/2673017-6468914824-Image.png\"></a><figcaption>Just as elemental interactions can stun and burn bad guys, you can accidentally do the same thing to yourself.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The experience is, in many ways, one of your own making. Who do you want to be? That extends beyond the combat, and into the role-playing, as well. The game doesn't have a morality meter, and doesn't judge. Players have little money at the start, but an early gold hoarding tactic involves stealing paintings in the first major city, Cyseal. If you're not caught, no one seems to notice an art thief has invaded, and vendors buy the paintings happily. After nabbing a few, the characters have a conversation about their actions, briefly reflecting on their newfound hobby. The two banter back-and-forth about whether stealing the art is immoral, but it ultimately has little impact on...anything. +1 personality bubbles sprinkle above them, but that's to reflect the tenor of the discussion, and grant a minor buff. Heck, at any time, you can (try to) kill just about any character in the game.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It often feels <a href=\"/larian-studios/3010-1223/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1223\">Larian </a>has imposed structure on a sandbox to give players something to do, but doesn't care if you bend or break the rules. This philosophy is everywhere. Let's say you're having trouble with a particular boss. Before most major encounters, there's a conversation. This dialogue is only between the party member who initiated the conversation, and you can move other characters around while the dialogue tree is active. Get where I'm going with this? It's entirely possible to attack and kill a boss while it's talking to someone else. That always felt a step too far, but I love that it's an option. It's also possible to attack enemies before an encounter begins, which I took advantage of all the time. Sorry, goblins, about that sudden meteor shower! During a particularly rough sequence, I quarantined a set of enemies by crafting <em>a wall of chairs</em>. (Chairs, for whatever reason, are invincible in Divinity.) Some might call these exploits, and it's possible they're patched out, but Divinity is okay with you screwing around. Towards the end, there's a door that requires an item to open. You could go on a few more quests and find them...or spend 30 minutes bashing down the door. Your call!</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2673018-6497597064-Image.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2673018\" style=\"width: 1423px\" data-ratio=\"0.5621925509487\" data-width=\"1423\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2673018-6497597064-Image.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2673018\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2673018-6497597064-Image.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2673018-6497597064-Image.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can have up to four party members, but there are perks for travelling with fewer.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You don't have an option to skip the game's lengthy narration, though. An NPC here, some hero chatter there. Generally, the writing is pretty good; it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's funny. I'm a big book reader in my spare time, so I don't have a problem with Divinity dumping the equivalent of a novel on me. Unfortunately, the verbosity isn't backed up with characters and plotting worth the hours of attention devoted to it. Somewhere around the halfway mark, I was clicking through the conversations, waiting for the game to automatically populate my quest log with information on where to head next. Yet another generic end-of-the-world storyline can work when told using interesting participants, but that's not the case here. It's nothing new. The main characters are never given any significant development, serving as blank slates until a few endgame revelations that come too late. We learn more about the optional side characters who can join your party, but even those twists don't even happen until dozens of hours in. Divinity gives players broad discretion over how to play, which includes personality interpretation. This means we're left with an experience left to define itself on gameplay alone.</p><p style=\"\">If we're talking about the combat, Divinity's got that covered. Unfortunately, it's the other parts of the game that got on my nerves as time went on. The first time Divinity asked me to zoom the camera in to scan the area for a tiny, pixel-sized button to unlock a door, I let it pass. When it became the fifth or sixth time, I started consulting online guides without much remorse. This focus on obscurity is prevalent throughout Divinity, and extends far beyond hunting for buttons and switches. On one hand, Divinity avoids guiding players to a solution with huge, pulsing arrows. On the other hand, it often doesn't provide you with nearly enough relevant information to reasonably determine where to go or what to do next. Both characters and quest logs are incredibly vague, and I grew tired of trying to decipher their riddles. It doesn't help some quests can easily become glitched and unsolvable. If you can't tell the difference between a bug and poor writing, there's something wrong. When it became clear this issue was not one or two quests but a prevalent issue throughout the whole game, I started regularly referencing walkthroughs to keep the story moving forward. I didn't fall in love with Divinity's world, characters, or lore. I wanted more of its relentlessly punishing combat, and this approach gave me that.</p><p style=\"\">Playing Divinity to its lengthy (if predictable and stretched out) conclusion is a journey unto itself, an exhausting odyssey. The game asks much of players but rewards with them genuine, earned satisfaction. Even now, I could recite whole battles to you, days after the game's credits rolled. During one thrilling moment, I was literally biting my nails while a turn progressed. As victory became reality from the final blow, I tore off my headphones and screamed into the night. There are few games like Divinity in 2014, but it absolutely deserves to be here.</p>", "deck": "They may not make games like this anymore, but maybe they should.

That was four years ago, which is ages in annual video game franchise terms. <a href=\"/madden-nfl-15/3030-46157/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46157\">Madden NFL 15</a> marks the first time in a good long while that a Madden game left me feeling positive about the experience. It's not because this year's game offers up any one big, awesome new feature that sets it markedly apart from the last few entries. Instead, it takes a lot of the good, if clunky ideas from the last couple of games, and finally molds them into something that feels simultaneously exciting to play, and (mostly) technically sound. There are still problems, to be sure, but for once, those issues are outnumbered by positives in a significant way.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2675330-madden-nfl-15-screen-15.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2675330\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2675330-madden-nfl-15-screen-15.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2675330\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2675330-madden-nfl-15-screen-15.png\"></a><figcaption>There were a lot of very good reasons to be disappointed with Madden NFL 25. Madden NFL 15 still disappoints in a few areas, but is generally a much more consistently entertaining game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The biggest changes in Madden NFL 15 fall on the defensive side of the ball. Plenty of Madden installments have proclaimed to \"fix\" defense, usually by adding some new mechanic or stick functionality that still leaves you with pretty much the same exact defensive game you've been playing for years. Once again, I think saying that Madden 15's changes somehow salve everything potentially wrong with playable defense is overstating things, but what the game does offer is a nice change of pace. First off, now players can swing the camera around while playing defense. That sounds like a small thing, but it's actually a big help when playing on the defensive line or as a linebacker. Before, I always felt the defensive players were getting obscured by the offensive line. This negates that issue, and in concert with a new defensive minigame--you can jump the snap by hitting a trigger button at the right moment--it goes a long way to helping you play more effectively. In addition to that trigger button, you will also see button icons pop up when your defender is engaged with a blocker, indicating whether you should be using finesse moves or power moves to get by them. If that makes things too easy for you, you can just shut those off entirely, but for my part, I found them to be a helpful instructional tool.</p><p style=\"\">As good as all those changes are, they don't make playing defense a perfect experience. Playing in the secondary still often feels like a crapshoot, for instance. The reverse camera doesn't feel as effective when controlling a defensive back, and I still feel like I'm a liability any time I assume control of one. I did find myself pulling off a few more interceptions than I have in the past, but I can't attribute that to anything specific to this year's game. If anything, INTs are just as prevalent (or over-prevalent, depending on your opinion) as they've ever been. Hitting and tackling still has its issues as well. While I appreciate this year's control alterations--conservative and aggressive tackles have been assigned to separate buttons, and now you can square up defenders by holding down the LT/L2 button--tackles still result in a lot of strange, often awkward-looking hits. Some of this might just be leftover wonkiness from the implementation of the Infinity Engine, and it's not nearly as bad as it's been in the past. Remember a couple of years ago when players were literally tripping over each other at the end of practically every play? Yeah, it's not that bad. Still, it's odd to watch players' limbs bend and contort in inhuman ways any time they bump into one another. It's similarly disconcerting to watch players often go functionally limp when they collide, as if someone had just unplugged them from <em>The Matrix</em>.</p><p style=\"\">That last point has more to do with graphics than gameplay, but those kinds of graphical issues stand out a good bit more now that the series has planted itself firmly on the new generation of consoles. Last year's game on Xbox One and PS4 was just a minor upgrade from the 360 and PS3 versions, but Madden NFL 15 advances the game's visual presentation significantly. Stadiums, crowds, and sidelines have never looked better, and the action on the field generally looks excellent. You may see some weirdness with marquee players and coaches not quite looking like their counterparts--which is to say nothing of the haunting looking representations of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms that pop up at the beginning of each game--but this year's player models are nonetheless a huge improvement. Of course, with that increased detail, issues like physics glitches and hiccups in tackling animations tend to stand out all the more.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2675349-2673056-vf_maddennfl2015_ql.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2675349\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2675349-2673056-vf_maddennfl2015_ql.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2675349\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2675349-2673056-vf_maddennfl2015_ql.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Real life Phil Simms is creepy enough. Digital Phil Simms is downright nightmarish.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The offensive side of the ball hasn't seen as much alteration, but there is at least one nice addition in the form of tempo changes. Essentially, you can now toggle between the normal pace of the game, a no-huddle offense, and a deliberately sluggish \"chew clock\" option. The no-huddle option brings your offense to the line super quickly, though obviously limits the number of plays you can call. Chewing the clock winds the play clock all the way down to ten seconds before you break the huddle, which greatly improves the pace of late game situations. It's a really minor thing and it doesn't change the offensive game in any truly significant way, but it's a nice touch that I'm frankly sort of baffled hadn't been included previously.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Another big change to this year's game is playcalling. In the past, suggested plays were limited to the old \"Ask Madden\" feature, which would spit up a few situationally correct plays, and way back when would also offer up a bit of <a href=\"/john-madden/3040-33004/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-33004\">John Madden</a>-voiced coaching commentary (EA really needs to get him back in the recording booth some day). Madden NFL 15 expands on this considerably, offering up multiple suggestion options based on analytics. You'll still get a list of plays ideal for the game situation you're in, but they come with actual quantifiable data that helps explain why those plays make sense. And then there's a whole other category of plays built around suggestions from the community and how effective those plays have been in similar situations. It takes some getting used to, but I found it vastly preferable to any play-calling system this series has used in the past.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Of course, there are adjustments spread throughout the game's various modes and features, though most of these are minor in nature. Connected franchise still lets you create a player, coach or owner of your own design, and only two of those options are actually fun (sorry owner mode, you're still the worst). The big change to the mode this year is player confidence. At the top of each in-game week, you'll have the option to put your players through a series of pre-game exercises designed to boost a specific player, or an entire team's confidence. These are mostly non-playable exercises (though there are some in-game practice options available too), but there is a tangible benefit to doing them. Players with greater confidence tend to play above their stat ratings, while those lacking in confidence will more easily bottom out in arduous situations. This is essentially a play on the old hot/cold streak stuff from older games, but now you have a bit more control over it. This is nothing earth-shattering, but I think it's a nice way to handle the kinds of intangible swings inherent to professional football. I just wish it weren't the only big addition this year, because apart from some tweaks to the XP upgrading system for players (which finally make that feature feel useful), little else has changed for the better.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The same can be said for Ultimate Team, which has received a few tweaks in the name of making the mode more navigable, and not much else. It's still a mode I like a lot more in theory than in practice, as the progression of it still leans a little too heavily on inspiring the urge to pay for additional player card packs, versus just playing through the mode's offline and online challenges to earn coins. The skills challenge mode has been fleshed out with some additional trainers for specific game situations, and a surprisingly fun gauntlet mode that ramps up the ridiculousness of the regular training minigames. Online play hasn't seen any significant changes, though most of the games I played did seem a bit laggier/more stuttery than in last year's game. As always, your mileage may vary, but this was a bit more pronounced than what I've typically experienced in other <a href=\"/ea-sports/3010-6255/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6255\">EA Sports</a> games.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2675353-madden-nfl-15-screen-24png-e0e9ea.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2675353\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2675353-madden-nfl-15-screen-24png-e0e9ea.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2675353\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2675353-madden-nfl-15-screen-24png-e0e9ea.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2675353-madden-nfl-15-screen-24png-e0e9ea.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>If you've stayed away from Madden for a few years--and certainly, no one would blame you if you have--Madden NFL 15 does enough right to justify taking the plunge again.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All of the above changes go a long way to making this year's Madden feel the most consistently satisfying entry in the series in a good long while. While holdover issues like problematic offensive lines, sometimes clunky running mechanics, deeply confusing in-game menus, annoyingly repetitive (and periodically incorrect) commentary, and various glitches of both the minor and severe varieties are still present, I didn't find myself sighing with exasperation over them nearly as much. More often, I found myself too engaged with the act of playing video game football to care quite as much. Given that I generally like video game football quite a bit, it's sort of dispiriting to realize how long it's been since I've been able to do that. There are still a lot of things this series could stand to improve, but Madden NFL 15 represents an encouraging step forward for this series.

Instead, it's a crushing disappointment.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">NHL 15 represents the series' debut on the current generation of consoles. As with all yearly games on new consoles, there's always a concern of some features falling by the wayside as a team works to ensure their game actually runs on the new hardware. Last year, those concerns mostly didn't come to pass for games like <a href=\"/madden-nfl-25/3030-41459/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41459\">Madden</a> and <a href=\"/nba-2k14/3030-42632/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42632\">NBA 2K</a>. Madden 25 managed to keep its game intact on the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> by delaying any serious visual or gameplay upgrades to this year's installment. NBA 2K14 lost a few features, but still managed to deliver a game with solid depth and incredible visuals. NHL 15, despite being a year removed from the respective debuts of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, manages to both feel stagnant and deeply regressive at once. Here is the same core gameplay delivered by the last couple of NHL installments, tweaked and futzed with, but not greatly improved. Alongside it, it offers a featureset that is a mere skeleton of what hockey fans have come to expect from these games. It is, by and large, the same hockey game you've been playing for years, with even fewer ways to play it.</p><p style=\"\">But hey, don't take my word for it. Just take a gander at <a href=\"http://www.easports.com/nhl/news/2014/nhl-15-game-notes\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">this post from EA's official NHL blog</a>, which outlines the content the developers plan on adding to the game over the next couple of months via free patches. If you don't feel like reading through all of that, here's a bullet-pointed list:<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><ul><li>Playoff Mode</li><li>Be a Pro -- Coach Feedback</li><li>3 Stars of the Game</li><li>Layout and Player Item Animation Changes for Hockey Ultimate Team</li><li>Online Team Play</li><li>GM Draft</li></ul><p style=\"\">With the sole exception of the Ultimate Team changes, every single one of the things on that list is something that's been in a previous hockey game. In fact, a few of them have been in nearly every hockey game over the last couple of console generations. This isn't new content. It's the content you're already supposed to have, stapled back onto NHL 15's emaciated frame post-release. I shouldn't have to tell you why that's not acceptable for a game a publisher intends to charge full retail price for.</p><p style=\"\">That blog post offers no mea culpa on this, mind you. At best, it sidesteps the issue by referring to NHL 15 as \"the foundation to deliver next-generation hockey experiences to you for the years to come.\" The points on which this foundation is built? The visual upgrade afforded by the jump to new consoles, more realistic puck physics, and an improved broadcast presentation. All fine points, I guess, but none make up for either what's missing, or what's remained unchanged.</p><p style=\"\">Starting with those upgraded visuals, certainly NHL 15 on current-gen consoles is the best looking hockey game made to date. The upgrades to player faces and models are readily apparent the moment you boot up the game. Arenas look excellent, and the ice scrapes and deforms with terrific realism. Yet there are problems, too. Despite the uptick in model fidelity, animations often look stilted and awkward as players transition from move to move. It's not that much worse than what you've seen in previous NHL games, but it's more noticeable given how clear and hyperrealistic the on-ice action looks now. An exquisitely detailed goalie flipping up in an awkward spin maneuver to get back to his feet isn't made less weird by how good the model itself looks. If anything, it makes it weirder. You'll see a lot of generic, not-great-looking player faces too, especially once you start looking beyond the top players in the league. And for some reason, jerseys have been given an added coat of physics that makes them swish around in ways that make no sense. It's one thing to see a jersey flap as a player goes full-bore down the ice. It's quite another to have that flapping take place while a player slowly bends down in anticipation of a face-off.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2682009-nhl-15-upgrades.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2682009\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2682009-nhl-15-upgrades.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2682009\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2682009-nhl-15-upgrades.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This is certainly an excellent looking hockey game, but not so excellent as to make you forget about all the missing features.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That's by far the biggest offender when it comes to physics, though those new puck physics aren't entirely without issue either. By and large, the movements of the puck on the ice look correct. There is a proper weight and momentum to how it slides around, but for some reason, that properness doesn't always extend to goals scored. Apart from the usual issue of goals shot to the high corners of the net working incredibly often, a lot of the goals I ended up scoring throughout my time in NHL looked absolutely terrible. And I don't mean the kind of junky, off-a-rebound goals that are entirely correct for a real NHL game. I mean strange, unrealistic bounces and apparent saves turned into glitchy-looking scores. It's not all this way, of course. You can still set up beautiful-looking multi-pass plays, terrific one-timers, and the like. But those good moments come with a comparable number of bad ones.</p><p style=\"\">Again, the on-ice portion of NHL 15 isn't really the issue. It's still the solid game of hockey it's been for a while, though it's arguably more the same solid game of hockey than it's been in a while. Meaningful advancements in gameplay just aren't there this year. The AI is strong, especially if you bump up the difficulty--you'll see teams react to repeated tactics and change up their play accordingly--and the feel of the game remains highly enjoyable, provided you're playing against a good competitor. And really, that's vital this year, because there aren't a lot of other ways to play NHL 15.</p><p style=\"\">Yes, Be a GM and Be a Pro modes are still here, but they don't much resemble the modes as featured in the last several entries. The GM mode has its basic framework features, letting you trade, sign free agents, and futz with player lines for up to 25 seasons. But these features are greatly lessened this time around. All the minor league hockey interaction is gone--you can still send players to the minors, but you can't play any games with your AHL affiliate, nor do players in the minors accrue stats of any kind--rookie scouting has devolved into a brief menu interaction where you assign scouts to regions for various lengths of time, and you can't even draft your own players. Or rather, not yet, anyway. A GM Draft with a three-minute timer is coming as part of those content patches, which is a step, I suppose, to returned normalcy, but doesn't really fix how barren this mode feels.</p><p style=\"\">Be a Pro fares even worse. This mode has never been a beaming example of how to do individual player careers in sports games, but it at least had a flow to it that felt like a decent representation of what being a player drafted into the NHL might be like. All of that is gone now. In NHL 15's Be a Pro, your created player is no longer allowed to exert any influence over what team drafts him. He is thrust onto a team, and immediately sticks onto that team. Again, because there is no minor league hockey gameplay, you never have any risk of being sent down to the minors. You're on your team until it's time to sign a new contract, which you then do, and keep doing until you get your player up to a high enough rating where he warrants longer-term deals. On the ice, you can no longer simulate through shifts you're not playing on, so instead you have to watch your team play through every segment of the game. Even more maddening, the game is insane when it comes to doling out ice time. Though there's no coach feedback during games (something that is also supposedly going to be added back in via patch), you will still find yourself periodically demoted or promoted to different lines while playing as a skater (goalies obviously don't have this issue). Instead of diminishing your ice time, the game just gives you the same amount of ice time (a lot of it) while pairing you with worse players. You can get bumped all the way down to the fourth line, and still end up with the most ice time of any player on your team. It's infuriating.</p><p style=\"\">With those two marquee modes left as functional, if tedious husks of their former selves, all that leaves is Ultimate Team and online play. Again, online team play is coming back, but it's not in the retail release. The online GM mode, however, isn't coming back this year, so all you're left with otherwise is basic competitive play, which certainly works, based on the games I played during my testing. I experienced minimal lag and no major connectivity issues, so at least there's that. As for Ultimate Team, it is essentially identical to the way it's been in the last couple of games. Which makes a certain amount of terrible sense, given that Ultimate Team, with its microtransactions for card packs, represent the easiest way for EA to make additional money from the game.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2682061-nhl-15-doc-and-eddie-in-game.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2682061\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56\" data-width=\"850\" style=\"width: 850px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2682061-nhl-15-doc-and-eddie-in-game.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2682061\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2682061-nhl-15-doc-and-eddie-in-game.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2682061-nhl-15-doc-and-eddie-in-game.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>I like Mike Emrick and Eddie Olczyk as commentators, but the stuff they provide for NHL 15 isn't good.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Even the presentation of the game feels like it's walked back from previous years. Games are introduced with video footage of the arena you're playing in, as well as the real-life visages of Mike Emrick and Eddie Olczyk. The choice to use actual video footage of the two commentators is an interesting one that I think helps get rid of the strange, uncanny valley-ness you'd see in, say, this year's Madden with Jim Nantz and Phil Simms, but it also looks strange juxtaposed against the in-game players. More irritating is the in-game commentary itself, which is exceedingly light on detail or flavor. Olczyk barely talks outside of a few key game situations, and he rarely has anything of value to say. Emrick's play-by-play is strangely devoid of energy, and also feels like it was edited together by a complete lunatic. If you're into the idea of hearing Emrick yell the words \"geometrically\" and \"catawampus\" several times per-game, you may wring some amusement from this commentary, but none of it lands with any enthusiasm or excitement, and most of it barely qualifies as informative. The upgraded crowd noise is the lone audio upgrade of note, and it is certainly a huge improvement. Crowds react wonderfully to every play, booing the home team profusely when they give up a bad goal, and cheering wildly after a big play. If only the commentators could have exuded a similar level of energy and variance...</p><p style=\"\">I haven't even mentioned the non-existent customization features, the absent Winter Classic game, or any number of other, smaller things that serve to render NHL 15 such a profound disappointment. Sure, the game on the ice is still capable of delivering a thrilling gameplay experience, but this is also true of last year's game, and the year before that, and the year before that. EA can tout its unprecedented realism as a reason to give this year's game the benefit of the doubt, but that's not a strong selling point when it's the selling point for every sports game you release annually, especially when it's meant to make up for a wealth of discarded features. Whatever NHL 15 gains in visual fidelity, it loses several times over in depth and replay value. In asking players to pay a premium price for this game, you're implying that all the stuff that's been tossed aside in favor of just getting a game running on these machines didn't really matter, that you should still buy this game because it plays hockey pretty well and looks nice. Given that I've just dusted off my copy of NHL 14, and tossed my copy of NHL 15 on the shelf with no intention of touching it for the foreseeable future, let's just say I very much disagree with that notion.</p>", "deck": "Whatever steps forward NHL 15 has taken in visual presentation hardly make up for the alarming gutting of many of the series' best features.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-654/", "platforms": "Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-46242/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nhl-15/3030-46242/", "id": 46242, "name": "NHL 15"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2014-09-11 11:31:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-135256/", "id": 135256, "name": "NHL 15"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/destiny-review/1900-655/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/329/2681065-destiny_20140909163731.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2681065\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/329/2681065-destiny_20140909163731.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2681065\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/329/2681065-destiny_20140909163731.jpg\"></a><figcaption>As you might expect from a Bungie game, Destiny's pistols are quite powerful.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/destiny/3030-36067/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36067\">Destiny</a> is a terrific-looking first-person shooter with a solid foundation in its shooting mechanics. You might expect sound mechanics from a developer like <a href=\"/bungie/3010-476/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-476\">Bungie</a>, which has been making popular first-person shooters for years. But you might also expect things like an engaging story and a real variety in encounters from the developers responsible for <a href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">Halo</a>. That's where Destiny comes up profoundly short. When you throw it all together, you're left with a game where the missions are designed to be repeatable, but all the missions are so repetitive that it's hard to get excited to see the same handful of environments again and again and again as you attempt to grind out faction reputation or hunt around for high-end weapons. It's a beautiful game, but a hollow experience.</p><p style=\"\">The setting in Destiny is that humanity is already in dire straits. Darkness has spread throughout the galaxy and numerous factions, like the bug-like Hive and the murderous robots known as the Vex, are planning to put humanity out the picture for good. You enter the picture as a guardian of humanity, one of many, and you're sent out from the last city to attack back against the encroaching forces. This starts on <a href=\"/earth/3035-65/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-65\">Earth</a>, then moves to the <a href=\"/the-moon/3035-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-10\">Moon</a> before heading on to <a href=\"/venus/3035-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2\">Venus</a> and, finally, <a href=\"/mars/3035-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4\">Mars</a>. The story missions themselves are the bulk of Destiny. But \"story\" is maybe giving the missions a little too much credit. You'll get a little dialogue before you start a mission that says what you're doing, and maybe a few lines along the way. But Destiny is incredibly thin on world-building, story, and in-game lore, even going so far as hiding little bits of lore on unlockable \"cards\" that you can only see on the game's official website. There are somewhere around four cutscenes in the entire game, and most of the mid-mission updates are so full of space opera mumbo-jumbo and factions or other groups that you haven't heard of before, giving you no context for any of it. It's almost like they expect to flesh out the world in a series of books someday or something. Regardless of future plans, I found it hard to care about any of the lore in Destiny because there was very little of it and it all felt loosely connected, at best. Did I really accomplish anything when I finished the last story mission? It sure doesn't feel that way to me. If you were a fan of Bungie's narrative work in the past, you'll probably be disappointed with this aspect of Destiny.</p><p style=\"\">The story missions also suffer due to incredibly repetitive design. With one or two exceptions, every mission has you running to an area (often backtracking through areas you played through in a previous mission), finding an old or alien computer of some kind, and dispatching your friendly robotic ghost buddy to scan or analyze the thing so you can move on. Plenty of missions end with you finding a thing, having your hover ghost stare at it while you fight off waves of enemies, and then listening to a few sentences of largely meaningless dialogue. The menu is built in a way that seems to imply that you'd want to play through these areas multiple times and on multiple difficulty settings, but since most of the missions fail to distinguish themselves from one-another, I found myself feeling completely done with Destiny immediately after completing the final story piece.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/329/2681060-destiny_20140909160547.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2681060\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/329/2681060-destiny_20140909160547.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2681060\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/329/2681060-destiny_20140909160547.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some weapons have unlockable sights, but fancier sights come with a penalty to reload time.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Those story missions can be played by up to three players, and it's my strong recommendation that you don't play Destiny alone. Going in, guns blazing, as a team is far more enjoyable than going it alone, especially once you get to the back half of a mission, which typically places you in a restricted zone where, if all players die, the game resets back to a checkpoint. You can revive downed players or, in these zones, players can respawn themselves after 30 seconds. Having someone lend you a hand and keeping things moving is way more exciting than dying alone and having to reset back to try again. Unfortunately, you are forced to bring friends and acquaintances into story missions--there's no form of matchmaking to line you up with other players automatically. This seems like a needlessly restrictive move.</p><p style=\"\">By comparison, the game's competitive multiplayer allows for matchmaking, as do the cooperative \"strike\" missions. The competitive side of Destiny pits players against each other in a series of standard shooter multiplayer modes and typically flattens the level differences between players in an attempt to keep things fair. It's nice that you can level up your character in the game's multiplayer arenas, and you'll also earn a bunch of other, alternate currency and reputation that can be used to buy high-end gear. But I found the competitive side of the game to feel like even more of a grind than its cooperative side. It's lacking the inventiveness and playful nature of Halo's crazier multiplayer modes.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Strikes are longer player-versus-AI missions that allow up to three players to fight through a set area and face off against large bosses. The bosses in the game's strikes are larger than anything you'll see in the story, but most of the time the strategy boils down to spreading out around the large boss and shooting. As the different characters pull the attention of the boss, it'll slowly turn to fire, letting the other two players open up unabated. Since ammo ends up becoming a consideration, all the boss fights are also filled with regular enemies, who will drop ammo and, very occasionally, gear.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The loot situation in Destiny is weird. On one hand, you can equip armor to a handful of slots and acquire different weapons for your three weapon slots. On the other, the statistical differences between different pieces of loot don't make a meaningful difference to the way the game plays. You might find a fully automatic rifle that has a higher damage number than your old one, but aside from some occasional differences in muzzle climb, magazine size, and other small variances, it's the same as the auto rifle you're replacing. Compared with other loot games, which might have lightning firing out of you at all times or cows that sometimes descend from the heavens to do battle alongside you, Destiny's loot system feels half-baked.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/329/2681018-destiny_20140909133118.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2681018\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/329/2681018-destiny_20140909133118.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2681018\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/329/2681018-destiny_20140909133118.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/329/2681018-destiny_20140909133118.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Different enemies have different weak points, allowing you to score critical hits. In this case, shoot the flying eyeball in its eye.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">With its treasure-hunting reduced to a mere quest for higher numbers, the desire to go in and replay areas and strikes to find better loot is severely diminished. Even though some weapons get secondary abilities that might make reloading times faster with certain classes of weapons or some armor might let you throw grenades farther, nothing made such a major difference that I ever felt attached to a piece of gear. With that, the whole leveling system starts to fall apart. You equip better gear to remain competitive, but enemies that are at your level will always feel like they can really soak up some bullets. The boss fights, most of which are against lumbering, slow enemies that deal a ton of damage, exacerbate this issue even further. It gets boring.</p><p style=\"\">It's a real shame, too, because for as lackluster as the actual action and progression can be, Destiny's world looks fantastic. The art team on this thing must have had a field day designing cool-looking helmets, capes, and other bits of armor. The areas you're shooting through might be repetitive in nature, but each one has a real look of its own that makes it stand out, from the craggy surface of the Moon to the burnt-out colony on Venus to the wide-open sands of Mars. The game has terrific lighting, with great shadows that cast off of your team and the enemies. I found myself able to use the shadows tactically in a couple of spots, as enemy locations would sometimes be given away by their own shadow. And, of course, no one can do a sky box quite like Bungie. It's an impressive-looking game that, at least, is a joy to explore the first time through, if only to see each of the game's different areas and look at all the detail.</p><p style=\"\">But, yeah, its fantastic graphics often serve to make the game's mechanical underpinnings that much more disappointing. There are cool little flashes of brilliance in Destiny, but a lot of it feels like a game designed by people who weren't sure what sort of game they were designing. Is it a loot shooter? Sort of, but the loot isn't very good. Is it an MMO? No, but you'll occasionally encounter other players out in the field. A story-driven shooter like the Halo franchise? Sure, if you don't mind digging through the developer's website to find those little bits of lore. Clans? Again, they exist on the website but don't surface in-game in a meaningful way. The pieces are there, but too many of them feel malformed or half-realized to make Destiny recommendable. If you're interested in this sort of game, you may wish to wait and see what Bungie does in the months ahead before spending any money.</p>", "deck": "Destiny is a beautiful but hollow experience with most of the pieces you'd expect from a great multiplayer shooter.

Possibly their most critically revered franchise, the detours the series has taken have focused more on unique gameplay mechanics (sailing in <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/3030-18508/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18508\">Wind Waker</a>, manipulating time in <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/3030-13594/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13594\">Majora’s Mask</a>, transforming into a wolf in <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/3030-19467/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19467\">Twilight Princess</a>, etc.) than on genre-changing sequels.

In a series that’s always forced us to play as various incarnations of Link, taking control of the franchise’s other memorable characters proves to be one of the best elements of the experience. Each of them features a variety of unique special attacks, many of which can take out dozens of enemies in a flashy spectacle. This gonzo approach to combat can be a fun alternative to traditional Zelda gameplay. Whereas the main series has players placing and throwing single bombs in measured, specific fashions to open a door or defeat an enemy, Hyrule Warriors unleashes a barrage of bombs indiscriminately with one button press. It looks like a Zelda game at first glance, but Hyrule Warriors doesn’t take long to establish its wildly different gameplay.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2667020-45+-+7w8e9ml.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2667020\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2667020-45+-+7w8e9ml.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2667020\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/8/82063/2667020-45+-+7w8e9ml.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The new character Lana joins the Legend of Zelda mainstays.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, that’s what brings down the experience as a whole. Dynasty Warriors games have earned their reputation as repetitive, mindless button mashers. There’s certainly a specific audience for this, but Hyrule Warriors does little to appeal to those that don’t already belong in that group. Even as a huge Zelda fan, the novelty of revisiting iconic locations and playing as characters that aren’t named Link wasn’t enough to make me look past the gameplay. Fighting as Zelda is pretty cool at first, but the effect wears off when you’re jamming the Y button for the 500th time as you slash through another castle full of mindless skeletons. A few battles against larger boss characters help to shake things up, but these are few and far between.</p><p style=\"\">Elements of the game attempt to deepen the experience, but they’re mostly of the basic “find new weapons, collect materials to craft items, pay <a href=\"/rupee/3055-44/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-44\">rupees</a> to level up quicker” variety. Taking a trip to the in-game bazaar between missions is a nice way to tweak your weapons before your boots are back on the ground, but it certainly doesn’t distract from the mindless slashing you’re required to do 95 percent of the time.</p><p style=\"\">If you want to tackle these repetitive missions more quickly, a co-op mode is in place that allows a second player to use the <a href=\"/off-tv-play/3015-7482/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7482\">GamePad</a>. This does cause the framerate and resolution to take a noticeable dip, however. It’s by no means unplayable, so playing with a friend is a nice alternative if you’re tired of slashing through the hordes solo.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2667018-43+-+nqfvsms.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2667018\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2667018-43+-+nqfvsms.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2667018\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/8/82063/2667018-43+-+nqfvsms.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/8/82063/2667018-43+-+nqfvsms.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Great Fairies can turn the tides of some battles.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you’re a Dynasty Warriors fan that has stuck through its countless sequels and spinoffs and still aren’t tired of the formula, then Hyrule Warriors offers plenty more. If you’re a Zelda fan on top of a Dynasty Warriors fan, then it’s an obvious slam dunk. It has a full story mode, a free mode that allows you to play as any character, and even an NES-inspired adventure mode that has you completing challenges and collecting items across a map inspired by the <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">first Zelda title</a>. There’s no shortage of content, assuming the core gameplay is something that’s up your alley to begin with.</p><p style=\"\">Hyrule Warriors is an odd move for Nintendo, but it’s one that will make a specific audience of the gaming world very happy. As someone who loves Zelda and is lukewarm at best on Dynasty Warriors, I appreciated the references to the former while becoming frustrated at the bare-bones gameplay of the latter. This quirky offshoot is better than any Dynasty Warriors game I’ve played, while simultaneously being the worst Zelda game I’ve ever played.</p>", "deck": "This odd Wii U collaboration plays like a guided tour of The Legend of Zelda’s most iconic locations and characters.

While several leaks ruined many of the unlockable surprises, the secret characters are great choices and feature tons of clever special moves.</p><p style=\"\">Stages are characters in their own right in this series, and the new ones manage to hit the high bar of quality Smash Bros. is known for. Some involve a bit of interactivity, such as the Golden Plains level that offers stat boosts after collecting 100 coins. <a href=\"/pac-man/3005-149/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-149\">Pac-Man</a>’s stage even incorporates elements of the <a href=\"/pac-man/3030-7624/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\">original arcade game</a>, making enemies more vulnerable if you collect a <a href=\"/power-pellet/3055-685/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-685\">power pellet</a>.</p><p style=\"\">One area of downsizing is in the single-player offerings.

These customization options are great if you want to optimize your favorite characters, but you can turn off custom characters in multiplayer if you’re looking for a more traditional experience.</p><p style=\"\">For all the trophies, stages, characters, and other assorted goodies you can unlock by yourself, Smash Bros. has always been a multiplayer game at heart. The portable nature of the 3DS takes away some of the joy of playing with friends, as the series is best enjoyed on a TV with a traditional controller. Controlling your characters with the 3DS circle pad doesn’t feel quite as responsive as the <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a> analog stick (or even the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>’s nunchuk), but it’s functional. My main gripe with multiplayer was in its connection issues. Local play works fairly consistently, but I was frequently saddled with lag and connection issues when I tried to take the action online. This same issue was present with Brawl, but part of me hoped that Nintendo would have improved their online offering somewhat with this new entry. Unfortunately, Nintendo’s failure to evolve in terms of online play continues with this high-profile title.</p><p style=\"\">With Super Smash Bros. for 3DS, Nintendo has checked many of the biggest boxes for a sequel. The roster is bigger and better, a large variety of fun stages has been added, and some cool tweaks like character customization make their debut. Spotty online offerings, the drawbacks of being on a portable console, and the lack of a substantial single-player mode hurt the overall experience, but not enough to tarnish the series’ name. If you’re a longtime fan of Nintendo (or just the Smash series in general), there’s plenty here to keep you busy until you can play it in its ideal form on the big screen.</p>", "deck": "For the first time in the franchise's 15-year history, you can pummel your friends on the go.

Two, the students can kill one another, and if the murderer gets away with his or her crime, they'll be able to leave, but everyone else dies. You can imagine where it goes from there. In the sequel, it's the same premise, but it takes places on a tropical island. Players are cast into the role of <a href=\"/hinata-hajime/3005-25044/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25044\">Hajime Hinata</a>, a student who doesn't remember his talent.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">At the end of Danganronpa, a few students leave the school. It's not clear what happened to them, and Danganronpa 2 immediately starts playing with this idea, since Danganronpa players will immediately recognize a physically larger version of a returning character. What's he doing here? How come this killing game is playing out a second time? These questions are at the core of Danganronpa 2, and while playing the original will make everything that happens (especially towards the end) more satisfying, the vast majority of the game is playable for anyone who wants to dive into this bizarre series with the sequel.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The game itself is split into three distinct phases of gameplay: free time, investigation, class trial. During free time, players talk with the other students and learn about their backstories. It's a completely optional part of the game, but one that's recommended, as it allows players to discover the motivations behind their favorite characters. Plus, the writing is really goddamn funny, and the more chances to experience the tremendously witty dialogue, the better. Investigation is triggered upon the discovery of a murdered student, and has players exploring and analyzing crime scenes to come up with scraps of evidence for the coming trial. The evidence is written in your handbook as \"truth bullets\" because you, er, \"fire\" them at logical contradictions raised during the class trial. I don't care what anyone says, truth bullets is a <em>rad</em> term.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2687368-4631650774-danga.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687368\" style=\"width: 800px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2687368-4631650774-danga.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687368\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/9/93998/2687368-4631650774-danga.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Class trials are a timed affair, which means players are rushed, even if there's no real consequence for failing.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The class trial is where players become the most active, and it's where the series continues to falter relative to other detective games. In a nutshell, players apply evidence gathered during the investigation to figure out the truth. This comes in a variety of forms, but the most common is a conversation between the students in which the game assigns you a stack of evidence to contradict or confirm what's being said. Text scrolls across the screen, and certain words are highlighted while the conversation moves forward. It eventually loops. Everything is timed, though failure means little outside of a grading reduction. You can try over and over again. This starts out straightforward enough, but as the game goes on, the designers figured the best way to elevate the difficulty was to make the text extremely hard to read. It'll shake around, it'll be surrounded by other text. It's frustrating. Not helping matters is one-too-many contradictions that can't reasonably be figured out except through sheer trial-and-error. Danganronpa's interface makes it extremely difficult to consider all your evidence at once, which quickly leads to exasperated guessing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Despite how messy and confusing the conversations get, they're the best part, and it's satisfying when you nail someone who's got it all wrong. The game will occasionally mix things up with mini-games, including a version of hangman and infuriating takes on a rhythm and platform games. As Danganronpa 2 passed the 20-hour mark, its answers just within reach, I began loudly cursing a game about deduction that was asking me to deal with yet another platforming sequence with seemingly no collision detection whatsoever.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Honestly, I started referencing a walkthrough a handful of times towards the end. I was here for the story, and only the story. There's an option to ratchet down the difficulty of the class trial, and I recommend it. It's too bad, as the most enjoyable twists come during the class trial portion. True motivations are revealed, and the tricky ways various characters pulled off the ambitious murders are part of the fun. As fun as a cartoonish game about a robotic bear forcing kids to murder each other is fun, anyway. Don't judge me!</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2687367-2014-09-19-112515.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687367\" style=\"width: 960px\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2687367-2014-09-19-112515.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687367\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2687367-2014-09-19-112515.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2687367-2014-09-19-112515.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>...yeah.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There are other questionable elements from the original that stick around, too. For a game that otherwise does such a fantastic job of representing a wide variety of personalities and genders in its cast, it regularly goes out of its way to objectify the women under the joking guise of fan service. <a href=\"/akane-owari/3005-25046/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25046\">Akane</a>, the Ultimate Gymnast, regularly busts out of her shirt when angry...for no reason. Compared to the original, what's different here is how it tries to justify these moments by pointing them out. Just because the game is aware of what's happening doesn't make it okay, though maybe it suggests a localization team aware of the issues. It's particularly egregious for one character who constantly finds herself tripping into the most exploitative positions, and the game laughingly pointing it out. The game tries to layer another set of justifications during the class trial, leveraging it as a piece of evidence, but it was no less ridiculous. It adds nothing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Danganronpa 2 manages to match the madness of the previous game. In many ways, it purposely ups the ante, giving players plenty of reason to re-read old dialogue and consider previous situations in a new light. In the final hours, there are plenty of head-slapping a-ha moments that make the slightly too lengthy and murderous journey worth the ride. This is a series that takes joy in tricking the player, and not necessarily by laying out evidence along the way. The twists in Danganronpa are often out of left field, and so long as you're okay with the game constantly pulling out rugs, you're in for a good time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Whether that madness is ultimately satisfying is another question. So much of Dangranonpa 2 is an immediate, purposeful retread in both mechanics and storytelling. That loses its charm after a while, especially when the credits begin rolling, and it becomes clear not much has ultimately advanced after the events of the original game. A similar problem plagued the equally-out-there <a href=\"/zero-escape/3025-2302/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2302\">Zero Escape </a>series also produced by <a href=\"/chunsoft/3010-988/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-988\">Chunsoft</a>. This is a fun sequel spinning its wheels, capitalizing on what worked well before without real progress towards an endgame.

It starts with strong if familiar gameplay fundamentals, the climbing and exploration of <a href=\"/assassins-creed/3025-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-38\">Assassin's Creed</a> and the large-scale, counter-based melee combat of <a href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\">Arkham Asylum</a> most prominent among them. Then it adds on a strikingly deep dynamic AI system that populates the game world with an ever-changing cast of tough, distinctive enemies for you to tangle with over and over. Whatever your feelings on <a href=\"/j-r-r-tolkien/3040-47777/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-47777\">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> and the <a href=\"/middle-earth/3035-193/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-193\">Middle-earth</a> milieu, it's hard to imagine any fan of open-world action having anything less than a great time with this game.</p><p style=\"\">Shadow of Mordor refers to that AI framework as the nemesis system, and it's not like anything I've seen in this genre before. It creates a command hierarchy of <a href=\"/orc/3015-492/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-492\">orc</a> war chiefs, and several layers of captains underneath them, who dynamically move around the game world, undertaking their own missions to gain in power--unless you put them down first. Each captain has a long list of strengths and weaknesses that come into play when you fight them, forcing you to change up your tactics practically every time you face a new adversary. The enemies' movements feel truly random, since you never know when you'll run into one of them--or several--in the course of doing other missions or simply running around performing combat challenges and looking for collectibles. The game is given to providing you a lot of unexpected \"holy crap\" moments--it only took me an hour or so before I stumbled into my first run-in with four or five different captains at once, which forced me to turn tail and get the hell out of there.</p><p style=\"\">As the game goes on, you get more and more ways to subvert the chain of command, or make it work for you, by dominating specific captains and sending them after other targets, or issuing death threats that dramatically increases the power of a specific captain but makes the potential rewards he drops on death that much better. Even when a specific captain isn't on a mission of his own, you can still target him and travel to the region of the map where he's hanging out in order to murder him on your own time. This becomes crucial later in the game when you're attempting to take down the strongest war chiefs, who have numerous bodyguards with them everywhere they go. Playing captains against other captains, capitalizing on the unique weaknesses of an otherwise resilient foe, turning a dominated bodyguard against his master at the right moment; Mordor begins to feel a little like a strategy game when you really dig into it. It's a hell of a lot of fun.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2687408-middle-earth%E2%84%A2_+shadow+of+mordor%E2%84%A2_20140930144244.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687408\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2687408-middle-earth%E2%84%A2_+shadow+of+mordor%E2%84%A2_20140930144244.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687408\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/30/2687408-middle-earth%E2%84%A2_+shadow+of+mordor%E2%84%A2_20140930144244.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The variety, personality, and ubiquity of the captains are what really gives the game its legs.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's one thing that the nemesis system works as advertised on a technical level, but Monolith went the extra mile and gave the orc captains such a great dramatic flourish that it's hard not to get worked up the second they come on the scene. There's a staggering amount of variety in the names, character designs, and personalities of the captains you run into. As soon as one of them spots you, the game zooms in and gives them a chance to show off how repugnant they are. Most of them spit some kind of brutal challenge at you in their guttural Cockney accents. One of my captains, Bugabug the Singer, issued all of his challenges in verse. Another guy said nothing, instead just squealing and clicking his teeth at me. The more you beat them up, the gnarlier and more injured they'll be the next time they show up, and they'll make specific references to their injuries. They make specific references to all of your interactions with them, actually; there's a enormous amount of dialogue tailored to your previous encounters that really gives the game world life and makes the whole thing more believable. A lot of what these guys have to say is really dark and twisted, too. Just ugly, fun stuff.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Underneath the nemesis system, the combat in Shadow of Mordor is plenty fun to engage with. Climbing around ruins, sprinting across open plains, sneaking around and killing stealthily, fighting two dozen orcs in open combat; it's all a breeze to play. It's pure power fantasy in the most brutal terms. The game mechanics are also bursting with ways to distract or subvert enemies by attracting vicious animals (which you can ride) to savage them, dropping the equivalent of bees' nests on them, setting off huge explosions, poisoning their grog to make them go nuts, and more. Combine all these different combat options with the dynamic nemesis AI and the fact that scores of orcs will show up to the biggest battles, and the result is a specific kind of chaotic, emergent nonsense that's exactly what you want out of combat in an open-world game.</p><p style=\"\">Shadow of Mordor's rooting in the fiction that birthed <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> will probably be a take-it-or-leave-it sort of thing if you've only seen the <a href=\"/peter-jackson/3040-59905/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-59905\">Peter Jackson</a> films. I found the storyline's repeated appeals to that audience really obvious and forced (Hey, <a href=\"/gollum/3005-9177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9177\">Gollum</a>'s here for no particular reason! Oh, <a href=\"/saruman/3005-6619/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6619\">Saruman</a> is controlling another monarch? You don't say.) But the game does display some reverence for the greater fiction, which manifests on the periphery in a lot of one-off incidental dialogue, descriptions of artifacts you can find, and cinematic depictions of some of Arda's formative events. You'll need to have made it at least as far as the novels' appendices and be familiar with the more prominent parts of <i>The Silmarillion </i>to pick up on or care about any of this. Some of these references are lovingly handled, but then some of the Second Age events that were contrived for this game take fairly ludicrous dramatic liberties that the most diehard purists will probably roll their eyes at. Professor Tolkien has probably done quite a few rotations in his grave at both those and the amount of over-the-top ultraviolence in the combat, but on the whole, you could come up with a far worse affront to the sacrosanct original work than what's in this game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2687411-middleearthshadowofmordor_talioncelebrimborgollum_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687411\" style=\"width: 3840px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2687411-middleearthshadowofmordor_talioncelebrimborgollum_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687411\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/30/2687411-middleearthshadowofmordor_talioncelebrimborgollum_screenshot.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/30/2687411-middleearthshadowofmordor_talioncelebrimborgollum_screenshot.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some of the Lord of the Rings tie-ins are a bit ham-fisted, but it's nothing terribly offensive.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is a really nice-looking game, with a tremendous amount of side content to keep you busy for at least 15 or 20 hours. The mechanics of the story missions are adequate but not incredibly exciting, though the designers rightfully saw fit to weave the nemesis system into the story objectives frequently enough. Most of the side activities come in the form of basic but satisfying combat challenges and slave-freeing endeavors, and they all contribute to an enormous upgrade system that expands your combat options. There's even a rudimentary loot system, as the captains drop randomized runes you can equip on your weapons to customize your combat powers a bit. Given that the nemesis system provides a nearly endless cycle of side content, it would be difficult to come away unsatisfied at the end of the game with the amount of gameplay in here.</p><p style=\"\">Shadow of Mordor is going to give other developers in this genre a lot to think about. This would be a perfectly competent open-world game even without the dynamic AI, but that one system works so well that it makes you feel like you're having a tailored game experience that's unique to you and your actions. That's a powerful feeling, and I hope it's one similar games make the same effort to replicate in the future.</p>", "deck": "This perfectly competent open-world game gets a heck of a lot more interesting when it throws an endless host of savage, dynamic AI enemies into the mix.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-673/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-44484/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/3030-44484/", "id": 44484, "name": "Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2014-09-30 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-132672/", "id": 132672, "name": "Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die-review/1900-674/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"/hidetaka-suehiro/3040-97866/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97866\">Hidetaka \"Swery65\" Suehiro</a> makes strange games.

Essentially a half-busted third-person action game slathered in David Lynch-ian oddness, Deadly Premonition slowly but surely developed a rabid fanbase due largely to its bizarre aesthetics and comically ludicrous storyline. It wasn't exactly a very good game, but that didn't matter, because despite couching itself in familiar design elements, it still felt like something excitingly unfamiliar; otherworldly, even. Certainly it's not as if video games don't deal in weird on a regular basis, but Swery and his team at Access Games' brand of weird, as seen in Deadly Premonition, served as a signal that this was a creative voice--albeit a potentially insane one--worth paying attention to.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2684409-d4-11-png.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2684409\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2684409-d4-11-png.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2684409\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/18/187968/2684409-d4-11-png.png\"></a><figcaption>Meet David Young, former cop, current time traveler, future hangover sufferer.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die/3030-42899/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42899\">D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die</a> reassures us of this notion. In following up Deadly Premonition, Swery has evidently taken note of what people found so intriguing about his last game, while still managing to deliver something fairly different in overall design. Instead of a third-person shooter, D4 wraps itself in the design tropes of point-and-click adventure games, tasking you with solving crimes by exploring environments, exchanging long strings of dialogue with oddball characters, and uncovering evidence. You'll be forgiven if you feel a twinge of exasperation as I tell you that this is also a <a href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\">Kinect</a> game, though use of Microsoft's previously packed-in camera controller is optional. I played a decent amount of D4 with a controller, and the game works just fine that way. But if you really want to dive into the madness of D4, using the Kinect camera is absolutely recommended. I don't think I've ever recommended a Kinect-based control scheme when it wasn't 100% required, but given that this is a Swery game, perhaps it's no surprise that the unconventional way of playing D4 turns out to be its ideal.</p><p style=\"\">In D4, you play as David Young, a haggardly depressed ex-cop so haggardly depressed that you just know he's got a murdered wife somewhere in his past. Formerly of the <a href=\"/boston/3035-433/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-433\">Boston </a>P.D.'s narcotics unit, David quit the force after his wife--the uniquely named Little Peggy--is killed in a shooting that may or may not have something to do with a new and incredibly popular street drug called \"real blood.\" During the crime, David also took a bullet to the head, yet somehow survived. As is custom in head-shootings, the lead in his brain has given him the unique ability to travel back in time using \"mementos,\" objects that are associated with key moments in history. He uses these objects to solve crimes by inserting himself into the past. He is not merely an observer when he travels, but an active participant, able to physically engage and converse with the world around him.</p><p style=\"\">That D4 stars a partial amnesiac former cop who uses a magic bullet lodged in his brain to travel through time solving mysteries is arguably the least weird thing about it. David is certainly an odd character--the fact that the actor who portrays him slides in and out of his hilariously terrible Boston accent at seemingly random intervals certainly helps--but the people he meets over the course of D4's first episodes are several orders of magnitude crazier than anything he's able to muster. Without spoiling their context, some of those characters include his gluttonous former partner <a href=\"/forrest-kaysen/3005-14749/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14749\">Forrest Kaysen</a>, who inhales pizza and hot dogs like a sentient black hole; a literally feral woman named Amanda who behaves like a cat and somehow has been allowed to take up residence in David's apartment; a snippy flight attendant who uses an inhaler to get high, often in the middle of conversations; a peril-obsessed OCD sufferer who counts the number of times windows on an airplane squeak; a slow-talking giant who laboriously spouts crypticisms while menacingly playing with a knife and fork; a flamboyant drug courier who refuses to stop talking about his glass eye; and an even more flamboyant, mannequin-toting fashion designer who exists as a sort of cross between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(mythology)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Pygmalion</a> and <a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2687391-0319230_12136_mc_tx360.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"2687391-0319230\">Meshach Taylor</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2684410-d4-12-png.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2684410\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2684410-d4-12-png.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2684410\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/18/187968/2684410-d4-12-png.png\"></a><figcaption>It's not often I get to recommend a game's Kinect controls, but using the camera is definitely the ideal way to play D4.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Every single one of these characters is amazing, so much so that it's absolutely worth digging through every possible conversational nugget the game offers just to see what bonkers thing will come out of their mouths next. Though a fair amount of that conversation is baked into the story progression, many of the best bits require exploring beyond the main path. At times, as with the aforementioned slow-talking giant, that conversation can begin to drag. You can skip any dialogue bit, but there's often quite a lot of it, and in cases where you are, say, speaking to a man who sounds like a record slowed down to 1/4 speed, it can straight up kill the game's pacing. Still, those problematic parts are worth the risk compared to how many genuinely, insanely funny parts you'll experience otherwise. Once you get to David's apartment, definitely seek out every extra bit you can with Forrest, so that you can witness some of the grossest acts of pure gluttony ever portrayed in a game, while also listening to one of the looniest conversations anyone's ever had about the differences between Boston and New York clam chowder recipes.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">This is what struck me most about D4. It's something apparent in Deadly Premonition, too, but D4 hammers home just how wonderfully skewed the developers' perception of American culture really is. Imagine telling someone from another culture the five or six things you can immediately remember about the city of Boston, then ask them to write a story set in the region using only that information. That's how D4 comes across; just informed enough to seem correct on the surface, while flailing wildly and unpredictably once you get past that thin veneer. Between the clam chowder debates, the experimental-sounding accents, and the fake Dropkick Murphys song that pops up during a few action sequences, D4 creates a version of Boston that feels born out of an alien simulation, and the game is so much better for it.</p><p style=\"\">Strange, then, that D4 is designed in such a way as to make exploration of that world a chore. Because this is a game designed with Kinect in mind, every action comes with a specific gesture (or gesture icon you can highlight using the controller) attached to it. You can't just walk around an environment, so much as you can select a traversal icon, which will then take you to the next available spot. You can move the camera around and spin David around 360 degrees in most situations, so it's not exactly difficult to get to the stuff you want to examine, but it still takes a bit longer to get around than is comfortable. More irritating is the game's stamina system, which drains any time David moves anywhere or does anything. It doesn't drain in huge chunks, and the game is decent about meting out power-ups you can use to regain stamina, but it's not enough to prevent the system from getting in the way. Instead of being able to freely poke and prod at every bizarre thing you see, you have to keep eyeing a meter to ensure that going and having a conversation with someone won't cause you to drop dead and the mission to restart.</p><p style=\"\">Fortunately, this is about as clunky as D4's gameplay gets. Investigation is a relatively simple process, streamlined by your ability to highlight objects of note in the environment using your psychic powers (powers you replenish by drinking booze, of course). By and large, the Kinect controls work as you would want them to, and the game is good about throwing a variety of gestures at you. You'll do plenty of holding up hands to select icons and random swipes to mimic on-screen actions, but you'll also find yourself swinging your arms as though you were holding a baseball bat, pantomiming the action of drinking tequila and pounding the shot glass, and even activating your magical detective powers by putting your fingers up to your temples like you're some hack psychic from the '50s. The relative ease of Kinect motion isn't altogether lost when switching to a controller. Most hand motions are replaced by control stick movements, which works well enough, but sometimes distracts from the chaos going on on-screen, which you most certainly do not want to miss.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2684413-1379684728-d4-screenshot-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2684413\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2684413-1379684728-d4-screenshot-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2684413\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/18/187968/2684413-1379684728-d4-screenshot-2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/18/187968/2684413-1379684728-d4-screenshot-2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Look, you should probably just play D4.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The very fact that D4 is a Kinect-focused game makes it something of a difficult sell, nowadays. That it is also an episodic game, and one from a developer best-known for a cult oddity that even its most ardent fans have a difficult time explaining succinctly, perhaps spells doom for D4. I only mention this because of D4's episodic structure, which might prove a problem if the game doesn't find an audience. The $15 download currently available nets you a prologue episode and two full episodes, which span a single case. That second episode ends on a particularly stiff cliffhanger, and it doesn't even begin to wrap up the larger mystery surrounding who killed Little Peggy and why. And even if this season's additional episodes are in the can (I'm assuming there are more episodes to this season than just the two provided here), there's no guarantee of a season two that I'm aware of.</p><p style=\"\">That said, I'd have no problem dropping that price for what pieces of D4 are there, even without an eventual resolution. D4 isn't what I'd easily call a good game, but it's a good enough one built around such magnificently strange material that I have zero qualms about recommending it to just about anyone. I guarantee half the people I'd recommend it to will find it impenetrably weird, but that other half will adore what Swery and his team have constructed, and hopefully will continue constructing, in D4.</p>", "deck": "Access Games' episodic follow-up to Deadly Premonition is a tremendously strange trip.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-674/", "platforms": "Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42899/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die/3030-42899/", "id": 42899, "name": "D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-09-30 14:25:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-137609/", "id": 137609, "name": "D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/forza-horizon-2-review/1900-675/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2683697-ram-runner-wm-car-reveal-week-7-forza-horizon-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2683697\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2683697-ram-runner-wm-car-reveal-week-7-forza-horizon-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2683697\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/2840/2683697-ram-runner-wm-car-reveal-week-7-forza-horizon-2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>With as much off-road space as the game has, it's nice that you'll have a few trucks and SUVs at your disposal.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Forza Horizon 2 is a strong, fun-first racing game that will be best suited for people who like to just drive around and do whatever. I can say this, because I spent my first four or five hours with the game just cranking through its championships, one after the next. That, as it turns out, is an extremely boring way to play. Also, it's not an especially effective one, as most of the progression indicators in Forza Horizon 2 are sort of meaningless. Aside from needing to earn credits to purchase cars, and unlocking a handful of novel showcase races by playing championships, the game is mostly laid out right from the start, letting you take it in however you like. Don't make my mistake--just cruise around and enjoy the scenery and you'll find Horizon 2 to be a relaxing, good time.</p><p style=\"\">Ultimately, this game is largely similar to the first Forza Horizon, released back in 2012. It takes the serious car game chops of Forza Motorsport and gets it off the track and into an open-world take on Europe. Bits of France and Italy are represented here, which boils down to long stretches of windy roads that connect small villages and other, more populated areas. The off-roading in Horizon 2 is a lot of fun, but overall I think I slightly prefer the road layout in the previous game. Either way, there's plenty of ground to cover in a decent collection of different events.</p><p style=\"\">The championship events take you around the environment--you start a \"road trip,\" which takes you to one of the game's hubs. Then you participate in four race events. Then you road trip over to the next hub and do it all over again. Before entering a series the game gives you a chance to change cars, which determines which sorts of races you'll enter. The game equalizes your competition against your vehicle, so in addition to a series only allowing \"hot hatches\" or \"hypercars,\" they'll also be upgraded to a similar level. This makes sense, since it keeps the races close, but it also sort of makes upgrading your car feel a little meaningless since everything else just upgrades (or downgrades) alongside you. Racing through and winning championships is the primary bit of progression for the single-player portion of the game, as it brings you closer and closer to the \"horizon finale.\"</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2683698-volkswagen-beetle-wm-car-reveal-week6-forza-horizon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2683698\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2683698-volkswagen-beetle-wm-car-reveal-week6-forza-horizon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2683698\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/2840/2683698-volkswagen-beetle-wm-car-reveal-week6-forza-horizon2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can race against those hot air balloons, but those showcase races are more of a novelty than anything else.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Beyond that, there are other ways to progress as you play, but since the only things that limit you are the cars you own, things like your \"driver level\" and how many perk points you've earned don't feel like that big of a deal. The perks, however, are a nice touch. As you drive skillfully you'll earn skill points that, when a meter is filled, spit out a perk point. You spend this on a screen full of different full-time perks... some of which just give you more credits and XP for finishing events. But the later perks let you fast travel anywhere and put icons over the cars you need to take photos of for the \"take pictures of every car in the game\" challenge, so they're certainly of some value.</p><p style=\"\">Online, the road trip takes on a slightly different style and starts to resemble EA's Need for Speed Most Wanted. The online players are asked to drive to a location, then an event jumps off. Along with standard races, things like team races and sillier modes like infection come up, too. At the end of a series, credits and XP are doled out, players vote for the next location and car class, and the whole thing begins again. There's also a large social leaderboard aspect to Horizon 2, which tells you when you've blasted by a speed camera faster than your friends or fellow club members and serves up ghosts for you to race against. The rivals/ghosts aspect of the game is less than ideal, though, because it tells you <i>after</i> you've finished a race that there's someone faster than you. I don't know about you, but the last thing I wanted to do after completing an event was to race that exact same event again.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2683684-lancia-delta-wm-car-reveal-week3-forza-horizon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2683684\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/2683684-lancia-delta-wm-car-reveal-week3-forza-horizon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2683684\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/2840/2683684-lancia-delta-wm-car-reveal-week3-forza-horizon2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/2840/2683684-lancia-delta-wm-car-reveal-week3-forza-horizon2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Here is a third picture of a car.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Forza Horizon 2 has a decent variety of events, but it's not bursting at the seams or anything. There are little XP and fast travel bonus boards to smash through, a \"bucket list\" full of short, specific tasks to complete, an online freeroam, car painting and tuning, AI drivers that roll through the world, daring you to challenge them, and so on. Overall, the AI is much more reasonable than it was in Forza Motorsport 5. Also, while we're comparing, it's worth noting that Horizon 2 doesn't have any of the \"car token\" stuff from the previous couple of Forza releases. You can't use real money in lieu of in-game credits and you can't buy a \"better\" map of the world that shows all the collectibles. The only transactions in there involve adding new cars to the game via a \"VIP\" purchase or buying a season pass of cars... or a \"car pass,\" if you will. This wouldn't normally be worth mentioning as it's pretty standard for games to have post-release DLC, but considering how nuts the past couple of games could be with this stuff, it's worth noting.</p><p style=\"\">Visually the game looks really nice, and it's not just polygonal crowds that make it look that way. The game delivers a really nice sense of speed and tears up crops and other terrain quite nicely when you find yourself spinning broadies in the middle of a field. The car models are top-notch and it's got a good draw distance, though I found myself noticing some low-quality shadows and a little bit of draw-in here and there. It also sounds nice and features a larger soundtrack of radio stations, though the radio DJs get a little repetitive and I think I preferred the tunes in the previous Horizon to this batch.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Overall, Horizon 2 isn't quite the breath of fresh air that the previous game was, but it's a good open-world driving game that benefits from slow play. If you're the type of person who wants to lay back and relax with a video game, you'll probably have a great time. But let me reiterate, if you're a \"blaze through this game as quickly as possible\" sort of player, the endless chain of races in Horizon doesn't deliver enough variety to make the trip worthwhile.</p>", "deck": "Forza Horizon 2 is a solid open-world racing game that takes Forza's slavish devotion to car culture in a friendlier direction.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-675/", "platforms": "Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-46474/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/forza-horizon-2/3030-46474/", "id": 46474, "name": "Forza Horizon 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-10-01 18:05:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-135244/", "id": 135244, "name": "Forza Horizon 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/alien-isolation-review/1900-676/", "description": "<p style=\"\">The biggest problem for any horror game is the unavoidable presence of the player.

It's big, bold, and about making players powerless. Isolation wants to scare the hell out of you, and it will. And while the game may try to do that for way too many hours, it's far and away the most ambitious horror game from the big leagues in a long time.

Her entire crew is dead (except the feisty Jonesy, obviously). Drifting through space, she patiently hopes for rescue.

She's a take-no-bullshit engineer, just like mom, and is approached by The Company (aka <a href=\"/weyland-yutani/3015-5134/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5134\">Weyland-Yutani</a>) about a mission to pick up the flight recorder for her mother's ship, the Nostromo.

Whereas Colonial Marines went out of its way to shove its connections to the films in your face, Isolation uses them as inspiration. Though the storyline functions as a dressed up remake of the original film, the team has captured the look and feel of Ridley Scott's iconic view of space life. Isolation is a stunning game to look at, one prone to moments of awe. It's easily the most beautiful nightmare I've ever experienced. Though I spent most of Isolation running scared, I'd often stop and look around, admiring the remarkable attention to detail just long enough to hear the familiar beeping from my motion tracker, prompting me to move along.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Presentation is vital to a horror game, too, especially to a cat-and-mouse experience like Isolation. At its core, Isolation is largely about biding your time, and moving towards an exit. There are few games that could claim hiding in a closet is a critical, valued part of gameplay, but it's a familiar comfort in Isolation.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Most sequences in Isolation play out like this: cautiously walk through a room with your motion tracker out, hide when the alien shows up, and inch towards your goal. If you run, you're dead. If you stand up and walk, you're dead. Sometimes, you'll be doing everything the way you're supposed to...and you're still dead. (This is when it seems like when the game goofs on spawning the alien, and often feels like a cheap death. One time, it happened while I was saving the game, despite the alien being nowhere in sight.)</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">While everyone else was running around in <em>Alien</em>, Ripley was a scheming survivalist, and the game treats Amanda the same way. Blueprints are scattered throughout the Sevastopol, and each allows Amanda to build something to help protect her--smoke bombs, EMPs, noise makers, etc. While various weapons are available, ammunition is scarce. It's preferable to avoid combat. For one, the xenomorph cannot be killed. It can only be scared off. Even then, engagement only seems to aggravate it, so distraction is the name of the game. There are other enemies to be wary of aboard the Sevastopol, too, including roaming gangs of humans who take none too kindly to strangers. More concerning are the humanoid androids with glowing red eyes that will stay with you long after the game is turned off. Mostly, you're worried about the alien.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The most memorable horror experiences in games have usually involved players barely scraping by--<a href=\"/resident-evil/3030-5842/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident Evil</a>, <a href=\"/silent-hill-2/3030-10780/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10780\">Silent Hill 2</a>, <a href=\"/system-shock-2/3030-8870/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8870\">System Shock 2</a>, <a href=\"/condemned/3025-104/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-104\">Condemned</a>, <a href=\"/amnesia-the-dark-descent/3030-30087/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30087\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a>. While some of these games offered combat options, it's hard to argue the player ever really has a serious advantage. As horror games have evolved, we've seen weapons stripped away.

One's tolerance for the trial-and-error gameplay driving Isolation will likely run the spectrum of opinion. There's rarely a moment to relax, and if the alien isn't gunning for you, the humans and androids are. You have few friends aboard the Sevastopol, and it can make playing the game for hours psychologically draining. I would feel physically tired after sessions with Isolation, and my wife would often walk away, unable to deal with yet another hour of mumbling \"oh shit, oh shit, oh shit\" under our collective breath. The moment you've escaped harm in one area, it's time to do it all over again in another. The game could actually use a few breather moments, but it never pulls punches. When Isolation works as advertised, it's the most intimidatingly scary video game I've ever played. I've been watching movies with the xenomorph for years, but it felt terrifyingly new in Isolation. You truly feel like you're being hunted, and it's an awful and oppressive feeling that lingers in your joints.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Once you're introduced to the alien, this acid-driven animal won't ever leave you alone. You two are joined at the hip for the rest of the game, a bizarre relationship that reminded me of the plot to <em>Jaws 4: The Revenge</em>. You're excused for not knowing the plot to the fourth <em>Jaws</em> film, otherwise known as the movie Michael Caine was filming when he won an Oscar. In <em>Jaws 4</em>, Ellen Brody, the wife of the sheriff from the first two films, has seemingly developed a psychic connection to a murderous shark that may or may not be related to the same shark family the Brody's had encounters with back at Amity Island. While Isolation doesn't try to suggest an extrasensory relationship between Amanda and the alien, it becomes increasingly odd that a creature that's so good at mass murder would spend all of its time tracking a single target, despite being present on a massive space station with potentially hundreds to easily pick off.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The game does a good job of surprising you with a new trick every once and a while, though. Hiding in vents is a common tactic, and I was almost always able to get away with watching the alien while the vent was open. But one time--and this only happened once--the alien spotted me and pulled me out. Later in the game, Amanda gets access to a flamethrower (because of course you do), and I was ready to burn some androids to the ground. When I found one, I let her rip. Unfortunately, the android was unfazed, and began slowly walking towards me. As I fumbled for another weapon, it approached me, asked if there was any way it could help, and began slowly crushing my throat. The android was on fire the entire time.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2689232-4328302406-alien.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2689232\" data-ratio=\"0.56475\" data-width=\"4000\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 4000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/93998/2689232-4328302406-alien.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2689232\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2689232-4328302406-alien.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/9/93998/2689232-4328302406-alien.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>EMPs, molotov cocktails, and other weapons help you keep things at bay.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">But the trial-and-error nature of Isolation has serious problems. In one early sequence, I was slinking my way through a maze of hallways with deadly androids. It was an unbelievable 20 minutes of close calls and audible gasps that ended with me barely making it to the other side. In the next room, however, the alien came out of nowhere, and because the game does not have checkpoints, I had lost all of my progress. Poof. The tension was now gone, frustration had set in, and I now looked at the room as a series of AI routines to be exploited, not horrifying robots bent on killing me. Taking this into account, I sprinted through the area that had <em>just</em> taken me 20 minutes, and finished it in less than one, with no alien on the other side. These moments are disheartening, but hardly the norm. More often, I'd escape close encounters by the skin of my teeth, my palms sweating and heart pounding. The most common emotion is wondering if it's better to look ahead...or keeping glancing over your shoulder.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Furthermore, Isolation wears out its welcome. It's a 20-hour game, a genuinely shocking revelation that would be treated with an embrace if the game was able to justify its length. Everything that could go wrong does go wrong for poor Amanda. She's about to escape! Nope. The alien has been taken care of! Nope. She's about to escape...again! Nope. There are at least three different times where it seems Isolation will cut to credits, but there's more surviving to be done. Whenever you enter a room with an objective on one side, get ready for the game to let you know something else has gone bonkers on the other side. This happened at such a relentless frequency that it became a running joke with my wife. \"Here we go again!\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The story here is thin, and the gameplay is simple. It's one note played over and over again, but it's one hell of a note. Isolation's a game about the bad things chasing you around, and that's about it. That's a good thing, since there are no deep systems to exploit, despite some promising ideas presented by the game early on. Manipulating the ship's power systems never really goes anywhere, and despite the game's tool tips suggesting some humans can become friends if approached properly, I never encountered anyone who could be dealt using anything but brutal force during my time in space. The idea of building transactional relationships with the Sevastopol's terrified citizens sounds cool, but it never materializes.</p><p style=\"\">While not without its issues, Isolation is the best <em>Alien</em> game since <a href=\"/alien-vs-predator/3030-21299/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21299\">Alien vs. Predator</a>. Given what fans have put up with recently, that's not high praise, but Isolation moves the bar much higher. On both the silver screen and in video game form, the xenomorph hasn't been treated with respect in a while. Isolation gets remarkably close to reminding us why we were so scared in the first place.

In an era where driving games on both ends of the arcade-to-simulation spectrum deliver car upgrades and a lot of other things that players can use to tailor the experience to their liking, Driveclub's complete lack of meaningful choices makes it feel like a weird throwback to the old, dark days of console driving games. The larger problem, however, is that the game's overly mechanical AI drivers and weirdly grippy car handling make the on-track action lackluster, at best.</p><p style=\"\">The action in Driveclub is broken up into a small handful of events that you can play a couple of different ways. In the single event mode you can set up on any of the game's tracks using any of your unlocked cars in a simple race, a time trial that lets you race as long as you like to set the hottest lap you can, and a drift challenge that scores you based on your speed through the straightaways and your drifts on the curves. If you like, you can have those events fed to you in a more-or-less set order via the game's tour mode, which sets up specific events and classes while also adding some occasional side objectives that earn you stars. Stars are used in the tour mode to unlock additional events in the tour mode.</p><p style=\"\">As you race in any event, you'll earn <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a> depending on how you drive. Earning stars in tour mode is a solid way to earn them, but doing things like drafting behind an opposing car, drifting, and clean passes will also add to your total. You lose points for leaving the track, colliding with other cars, and the total at the end of a race is added to your overall score. You'll level up along the way, which is how additional cars are unlocked. The car options are weak, with an almost-exclusive focus on European manufacturers. The developers have plans to sell car <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">DLC</a>, so perhaps this will eventually get addressed, but launching without big names like Honda, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford? It seems almost insane. On top of that, you can't do much with the cars once you've unlocked them. There are no tuning or upgrade options and, aside from a loosely customizable \"club\" paint job set by the leader of your current car club, even the paint options are extremely limited. Even the \"factory\" paint job option only offers one color. At some point Driveclub's lack of options crosses out of barebones and into simply appearing to be unfinished. Furthermore, the idea of a set progression of car unlocks instead of offering some way for players to unlock the cars they're specifically interested in feels old and somewhat restrictive for a game that seems like it's trying to lean in the simulation direction of things.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2689534-dc_jd_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2689534\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2689534-dc_jd_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2689534\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2689534-dc_jd_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The challenge system is one of Driveclub's high points.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But it's worth pointing out that Driveclub isn't an especially realistic simulation of driving, and apparently that's by design. The cars have an overly grippy feel on the track, letting you get away with some occasional shenanigans by braking at the last possible moment instead of gently braking or coasting into the curves. The developers claim this is an attempt to make the game easier and fun for everyone. But this doesn't make the game feel more fun or thrilling. It just makes what otherwise <i>feels</i> like an attempt at simulating real cars instead feel like it misses the mark by a mile. If this were on by default as an assist for new drivers that could be disabled, potentially along with a series of additional options to let people tailor the driving a bit, maybe this would make sense. Instead it makes the game feel inauthentic to real-life racing while also not going far enough in the \"fun\" direction to make it an exciting, arcade-style racer.</p><p style=\"\">It gets even weirder when you throw in the game's occasional attempt at enforcing rules. It'll let you brake extremely late into turns and you can pull e-brake drifts and such, but if you get off the track at all it immediately throws up a three-second timer that compels you to get back on the track. If you cut a corner in a way the game feels is giving you an advantage, it gives you a \"corner penalty\" and reduces your ability to accelerate for a few seconds. Same deal if you decide to slam into another racer--or if the game's single-minded AI decides to slam into you. Though cutting corners isn't cool, the way the game handles it with penalties is the opposite of fun. This seems like the sort of thing that should have been handled on the track design end instead of slapping drivers with penalties.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The game has a proper multiplayer option in addition to the single events and tour, and this allows up to 12 players to compete. The menus are slightly confusing, with a series of choices that don't seem especially different, since the game moves you from one event to the next and one car class to the next as you finish one event and start another, but the online portion of the game is certainly functional. Considering the game's focus on creating groups of users via its club functions, it seems odd that there isn't a big focus on clubs in the multiplayer. It's just a never-ending hopper filled with one-off races. It's worth noting though, that on launch day, and as of this writing, the Driveclub servers have been offline, preventing players from competing against one-another directly or via leaderboard challenges. Without these features, Driveclub feels like even more of a husk, but one has to expect that these servers <em>will</em> work eventually. They worked just fine during the week prior to release.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2689517-dc_screen_53.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2689517\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"8000\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 8000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2689517-dc_screen_53.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2689517\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2689517-dc_screen_53.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2689517-dc_screen_53.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Your car customization options consist of basic paint style changes and putting numbers and accolade icons on the side.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If there's anything Driveclub can hang its hat on, its that it's a nice-looking game and that it does leaderboards well. Of particular note is the game's <a href=\"/daynight-cycle/3015-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-92\">day/night cycle</a>, which you can speed up if you want to see the passage of time happen in a more dramatic way. Driveclub's night driving showcases its pretty lighting quite well, though considering you're trying to set good times and win races, I found myself gravitating towards having all my races take place at noon once I had seen the night stuff a few times. Cars shine nicely, again showing off the way light hits them, and it all looks quite striking when you hit dusk. That said, sometimes the ground and wall textures look overly flat and undetailed, and you'll see some scenery pop into view as you get closer to it. Nothing major, it looks good.</p><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"/leaderboard/3015-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">leaderboards</a> in Driveclub are supplemented by a challenge system that lets you take any of your recent past performances and send the time around to your friends. You set a time to respond when sending a challenge, so you can give those friends (or, if your challenge is open, strangers) a few as 30 minutes or as long as a week to respond. The winner of the challenge gets more XP and the prizes increase as more players join a challenge. This also carries over to clubs. Car clubs in Driveclub can be open or invite-only, and clubs are ranked on leaderboards, as well. You can create club challenges to challenge other clubs to beat your performance, and this makes it so each club only gets one entry on the leaderboard. So you can put your entire club onto one challenge and have them all bang away at it in an attempt to win, if you like. Annoyingly, people can send you challenges for cars you haven't unlocked yet, but all in all it's a decent system that would be a lot more useful if it were in a better game.</p><p style=\"\">And, ultimately, that's the real problem with Driveclub. It's a shame that there aren't more options to choose from and the challenge system has potential. But it just isn't much fun to play. The core act of driving a car feels off in a way that completely put me off of playing the game. Without that in place, the rest of it just falls apart. The PlayStation 4 has been without a serious racing option since launch, and Driveclub doesn't fill that gap.</p>", "deck": "Driveclub looks nice and has a couple of good ideas about handling leaderboard challenges, but the core of it--actually driving a car--drags the entire thing down.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-677/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-41693/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/driveclub/3030-41693/", "id": 41693, "name": "Driveclub"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2014-10-07 18:22:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-125459/", "id": 125459, "name": "Driveclub"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/bayonetta-2-review/1900-678/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2601370-12510866023_7bd2c07949_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2601370\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2601370-12510866023_7bd2c07949_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2601370\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/82063/2601370-12510866023_7bd2c07949_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dance-fighting demons on top of a fighter jet is a pretty cool thing to do.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I thoroughly enjoyed the original <a href=\"/bayonetta/3030-20710/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20710\">Bayonetta</a> back in 2010, but not enough to place it among personal action favorites like <a href=\"/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening/3030-890/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-890\">Devil May Cry 3</a> and <a href=\"/god-of-war-ii/3030-11314/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11314\">God of War II</a>. That’s why I was consistently surprised at how much fun I was having while playing its <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> sequel. “I don’t remember the original one being this great” was a thought that came up numerous times during my time with the game.</p><p style=\"\">It’s not that Bayonetta 2 radically changes anything that made the original popular, it’s the crazy amount of variety and responsiveness seen in the combat system. Every enemy encounter is a fast-paced, visually stunning test of reflexes and creative combos. At the core of combat is the returning Witch Time mechanic, which rewards a last-second evade maneuver with the temporary slowing of time. Harder difficulties basically require players to become extremely familiar with the move, and it’s a blast to lay into foes with combos while they’re unable to defend themselves.</p><p style=\"\">Purchasing new moves and weapons allows you to tailor Bayonetta’s offense to your personal play style, and it’s possible to switch between weapon loadouts on the fly with one button press. My personal favorite was dual swords in my hands and two <a href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-45\">flamethrowers</a> (which can utilize a separate ice mode) strapped to my feet. It’s thoroughly satisfying to slice up an enemy with a sword combo, launch them into the air, meet them in mid-air with a flying kick, and then hold the kick button to engulf them in flames.</p><p style=\"\">Bayonetta’s vast arsenal of moves and weapons are enough to keep fights interesting on their own, but the variety of enemies ensures you won’t get tired of the frequent melees. The standard encounters feature numerous types of minions, each with their own unique attacks and tells. Almost every chapter tosses at least one insane boss at you, many of which barely fit on the screen. These battles can be intense on harder difficulties, requiring players to recognize patterns and practice perfect evade timing. Most end in dramatic fashion, with Bayonetta’s hair morphing into some gigantic beast that destroys the boss in hilariously over-the-top fashion.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">All of Bayonetta’s combat capabilities would be for naught if the game’s controller options weren’t up to par. Thankfully, controlling the action is perfectly crisp and responsive when utilizing the Wii U’s <a href=\"/wii-u-pro-controller-support/3015-7591/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7591\">pro controller</a>. Playing with the GamePad is another good option, and full <a href=\"/off-tv-play/3015-7482/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7482\">offscreen play</a> is possible. The original Bayonetta featured the one-button Automatic mode, and its spiritual successor this time around is the GamePad’s touch controls. You can unleash combos on enemies by tapping them on the screen, but you’d be robbing yourself of much of the joy of Bayonetta 2 if you boil the razor sharp action down to something so mindless.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2646711-wiiu_bayonetta2_scrn09_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2646711\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2646711-wiiu_bayonetta2_scrn09_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2646711\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/82063/2646711-wiiu_bayonetta2_scrn09_e3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Activating Umbran Climax makes all of your moves far more deadly.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I don’t know what kind of maniac plays Bayonetta for the story, but the sequel is just as incoherent as it was the first time around. There’s a lot of talk about Umbra witches and ancient gods and time travel and other confusing nonsense, but it’s all just a silly, fun excuse for Bayonetta to kill a bunch of weird creatures in increasingly crazy ways. If you were a fan of the unexpected detours the first game made (the out-of-nowhere <a href=\"/space-harrier/3030-6036/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6036\">Space Harrier</a> tribute, for example), you'll love the situations seen in the sequel. The narrative shuttles Bayonetta everywhere from traditional city streets to the outer reaches of time and space, and you'll never know where the next mission will take you or what familiar faces you'll see there.</p><p style=\"\">A lot of info about Bayonetta 2’s unlockable goodies has already found its way onto the internet, but I won’t spoil specifics here. I’ll just say that some of the Nintendo-themed goodies are great, and I really liked playing around with them as I accessed them. As the game lends itself well to multiple playthroughs, you should have plenty of time to use unlockables after you initially access them. I only beat the original Bayonetta once, but I’ve decided to play through this one on every difficulty level, something I only do with my favorites in the genre. If you exhaust everything the game has to offer, you can always return to the original game thanks to its inclusion when purchasing Bayonetta 2.</p><p style=\"\">A new Tag Climax mode allows you to wager halos (the game's currency for buying in-store items) against a friend as you battle to see who can slay enemies more effectively, but it’s not really deep enough to serve as much more than a distraction. You can play against an AI opponent if you want another opportunity to earn halos, but there are plenty of ways to do it in the proper story mode that prove to be more entertaining.</p><p style=\"\">Bayonetta 2 doesn’t drastically change the already wacky formula that the first game introduced, but it’s a bigger and more nuanced version of its predecessor. It’s also the best game of its kind in years. If you’ve ever enjoyed this breed of reflex-heavy, hyperactive, ludicrous action game, Bayonetta 2 is a no-brainer.</p>", "deck": "Platinum Games' sequel delivers nuanced, non-stop action that stands among the best in its genre.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-678/", "platforms": "Wii U", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39764/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bayonetta-2/3030-39764/", "id": 39764, "name": "Bayonetta 2"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2014-10-13 20:22:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-119715/", "id": 119715, "name": "Bayonetta 2"}, "reviewer": "Dan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-beyond-earth-review/1900-680/", "description": "<p style=\"\">After three years of expansions and patches to <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-v/3030-30057/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30057\">Civilization V</a>, <a href=\"/firaxis-games/3010-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-361\">Firaxis</a> has moved its venerable strategy series off-world in <a href=\"/sid-meiers-civilization-beyond-earth/3030-45979/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-45979\">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a>.

But if you're the sort that spent countless, sleep-deprived hours building society after society in Civ V, you'll likely encounter the same creeping feeling of over-familiarity that I did.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2696416-screenhunter_958+oct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2696416\" style=\"width: 1908px\" data-ratio=\"0.58595387840671\" data-width=\"1908\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2696416-screenhunter_958+oct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2696416\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2696416-screenhunter_958+oct.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Civilization shifts away from its historical roots into the far-flung future in Beyond Earth.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Given that familiar feeling, it's tempting to call Beyond Earth a gussied-up expansion pack for Civ V. The nuts and bolts of Beyond Earth's basic UI, pacing, and visual design all feel in lockstep with what Civ V offered. Jumping into my first game, I had no trouble at all figuring out how to start progressing my new colony. Like always, I sent out a scout (explorer) to start looking for ruins (in this case, a mixture of \"resource pods,\" alien remains, and ancient alien ruins) and barbarian encampments (alien nests), began work on my first cultural monument (earth relic), and began researching my first technologies. But then, little wrinkles started to show up. I discovered that numerous areas of the map were coated in a noxious alien miasma, and that taking units through it would damage them. I also realized that alien creatures were numerous in ways that the barbarians of old never, ever were. Yet they were also generally non-threatening, unless I happened to wander too close to their teeming nests.</p><p style=\"\">The early game becomes a matter of figuring out the best ways to navigate around the more hostile aspects of the environment until you've researched enough technologies to start overcoming them, and this is by far the most exciting part of the game. There's a genuine sense of wonder that comes from exploring these harsh, alien environments, and a decent amount of variety to how you approach them. That variety comes in the form of the game's new affinity system. These affinities allow you to dominate your environment in one of three distinct ways. The supremacy affinity is all about transhumanism, turning your society into a fearsome, militaristic technocracy. The harmony affinity swings entirely in the other direction, blending humanity with the planet's native biology, and turning the planet's most toxic elements into a protective boon. Purity is all about retaining your humanity and turning your colony into something decidedly Earth-like.</p><p style=\"\">Each of these affinities comes with its own set of units, specialty techs, and victory conditions. Every time you complete a task or technology that boosts an affinity, your Civ gets a little boost. Sometimes it's just an upgrade for a particular unit type--these upgrades adjust the look of your units, in addition to their stats--and sometimes it's something felt society wide. Each affinity must be pushed to level 13 in order to unlock its victory condition, though you'll have to do more than just boost that affinity level to get there.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">You'll also have to finish quests, which are a new, if not overly exciting addition to the Civ formula. The quests that pertain to victories are static, and usually involve some combination of tech research and unit building to unlock a victory-specific project. There are also a pair of victory options that exist outside of affinities; one involves digging through ruins and unlocking an ancient signal from an unseen alien race, while the other is the good old domination victory.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2696413-screenhunter_955+oct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2696413\" style=\"width: 1913px\" data-ratio=\"0.59069524307371\" data-width=\"1913\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2696413-screenhunter_955+oct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2696413\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2696413-screenhunter_955+oct.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Combat is reasonably challenging in the early goings of the game, but once you get a few upgrades, it's a cakewalk to bowl over both strategically dim rival Civs and the indigenous alien life.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Those last two mark the only good options for victory if you find yourself lagging behind in the affinity specific ones. In Beyond Earth, planning your method of victory is essential from the get-go. This is the result of the game's reliance on its new tech web, a branching system of technologies to research that's initially daunting to get the hang of. There are a lot of different technologies to play around with, many of which you will have to actively ignore if you want to build up your affinity at a good pace. Victory quests do at least specify what technologies you'll need to research to win, but that won't prevent you from potentially falling behind other Civs, and once you have, it's extremely difficult to pivot to an alternate victory condition.</p><p style=\"\">This makes the late-game progression of Beyond Earth a bit of a drag. With most of the victory conditions being so similarly rigid in design, there's rarely any opportunity to throw off any other Civ's progress outside of military intervention. Once you get to the point of having your victory device built, you end up just waiting around--sometimes you have to press a specific button or guide a specific unit each turn as well--until the game is over. And even on some of the higher difficulty settings, the A.I. rarely seems aware enough of your impending victory to do anything about it. At best, they may denounce you, but it's extremely rare to see a computer player actually wage war in an attempt to stop you. Passiveness in A.I. is something that Civ V often had an issue with, and nearly every game I played in Beyond Earth demonstrated similar problems.</p><p style=\"\">Combat in general is not a particularly thrilling thing in Beyond Earth. At the outset, when all you have are a few weak units to deal with potentially huge volumes of aliens, there's a degree of tension when trying to figure out if you should engage or just hang back and defend. But once you get a few upgrades, they become little more than a brief nuisance. Strangely, the same feeling applies to combat against other Civs. Even though they advance units at roughly the same pace you do, they're rarely difficult to slice through in battles. Some of that is due, again, to the A.I., which can't often seem to figure out how to flank properly, or even properly navigate the terrain.</p><p style=\"\">The relative ease of those battles negates some of the fun you might have tinkering around with your unit upgrades. It's great that you get distinct choices for how you want your units to improve, but those bonuses are meaningless if you can just bowl over enemies regardless of what you choose. That kind of meaninglessness of choice became more apparent with each game of Beyond Earth I played. While it was initially fun to play around with different techs and buildings and wonders, after a while I realized that most of them didn't really have any significant impact on my ability to win the game. In Civ V, getting the right wonders and buildings built could greatly impact the speed of your Civ's progress. Here, it starts to just feel like busywork after a while, especially once you've gotten the necessary techs and units built to get the endgame race going.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2696404-screenhunter_946+oct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2696404\" style=\"width: 1910px\" data-ratio=\"0.59319371727749\" data-width=\"1910\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2696404-screenhunter_946+oct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2696404\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2696404-screenhunter_946+oct.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2696404-screenhunter_946+oct.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The new tech web is initially intimidating, but it's vital to plot your path through it early in the game if you want to succeed.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's not just buildings and wonders that suffer from this problem. There are tons of new tile improvements to build, plus new orbital units that provide culture, energy (the game's currency), and defensive boosts, among others, to swaths of your territory. Yet few of these things ever feel especially vital. I went through entire games just building one or two orbital units (often in cases where satellites were required for a victory condition), and got by just fine. The variety of tile improvements for workers to build ensures a diverse looking terrain by the time your game is done, but many of these improvements are just slight stat tweaks compared to other improvements you've been building since the beginning of the game. There is a ton of variety in how to design your society in Beyond Earth, yet little of it feels consequential to your path to victory.</p><p style=\"\">Other systems introduced in Civ V and its expansions have either been left as-is or removed altogether. Religion is gone, though you could argue that the affinity system is a more than capable replacement. Culture has been scaled back considerably, relegated to unlocking perks in the game's version of the policies menu. There are no great people to spawn, nor city states to interact with--the game's closest equivalent, independent stations that can be used for trade, offer little else in terms of interaction. Espionage, at least, has seen a more significant overhaul. Spies planted in other capital cities can still steal technologies, but not right away. You have to level them up by performing other, simpler tasks, like establishing a spy network, or syphoning energy. Performing operations successfully raises the intrigue level in the city, and opens up more elaborate possibilities. If you've exhausted the number of useful technologies a rival Civ has, maybe it's time to recruit some defectors in the form of stolen military units, or even stage a coup to overthrow the city itself.</p><p style=\"\">Except that rarely ever works. Performing a long string of successful operations is very difficult, because there's always a chance the agent may be detected. Detection does not equal death automatically, but even when not killed, agents are less effective once spotted, and usually need to be sent elsewhere to start all over. And even if you do manage to perform enough successful operations to get to those higher level ops, I never had a single one past the defectors mission succeed.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2696405-screenhunter_947+oct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2696405\" style=\"width: 1905px\" data-ratio=\"0.59317585301837\" data-width=\"1905\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2696405-screenhunter_947+oct.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2696405\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2696405-screenhunter_947+oct.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2696405-screenhunter_947+oct.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are some good ideas in Beyond Earth, but it's still got a ways to go if it wants to recapture the addictive qualities of Civ V.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Between these various issues, and Beyond Earth's unfortunate lack of personality, I had a hard time mustering up the desire to keep playing it beyond my first few play-throughs. That, to me, is the most damning thing about it. Say what you will about Civ V and its lingering problems, there was an intangible quality to that game that kept its hooks in you for long stretches of time. Maybe it's the lack of historical flavoring, maybe it's the lack of meaningful Civ personalities, or maybe it's the lack of consequence to the choices the game constantly presents you with. Whatever it is, there's definitely something missing from Beyond Earth's transcendental equation.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame, because Beyond Earth offers up a tantalizing premise that, nonetheless, feels incomplete. Its best parts are aesthetic in nature, changes to a visual palette that evoke a world of futuristic possibility. Yet the game itself feels regressive compared to the many changes made to Civ V's formula throughout its lifespan. People who thought better of spending countless nights clicking through turn after turn in Civ V might get a bit more out of Beyond Earth's alterations to that formula. But for those who, like me, dumped hundreds of hours of their fleeting lifespan into Civ V and its expansions, Beyond Earth is more a glimpse of potential greatness--the sort that would come from future updates--and less a great game in its own right.</p>", "deck": "Firaxis' sci-fi spin on Civilization V has some intriguing ideas that, sadly, don't come together into an equally engaging experience.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-680/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-45979/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sid-meiers-civilization-beyond-earth/3030-45979/", "id": 45979, "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2014-10-29 10:50:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-136858/", "id": 136858, "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-evil-within-review/1900-681/", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">It's hard to imagine how someone follows up <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a>, possibly the most influential game of the last decade.

You don't have to kill everything.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The Evil Within opens with detectives <a href=\"/sebastian-castellanos/3005-26240/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-26240\">Sebastian Castellanos</a>, <a href=\"/juli-kidman/3005-27417/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-27417\">Julie Kidman</a>, and<a href=\"/joseph-oda/3005-26331/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-26331\"> Joseph Oda</a> headed to a gruesome scene at Beacon Mental Hospital. Mutilated bodies litter the lobby, and it's unclear who's responsible. Castellanos discovers a supernatural presence with the ability to zip around the room at lightning speeds, and the trio's backup is quickly dispatched. All three are pulled into a hellish, everchanging nightmare under the control of a hooded man named <a href=\"/ruvik/3005-29740/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29740\">Ruvik</a>. Everyone around them has turned into zombie-like creatures with a penchant for murder, and thus begins a journey to figure out what the hell is going on. Spoiler alert: it gets really weird.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">When The Evil Within was first unveiled, it looked as though Mikami was simply picking up where he left off with RE4, and the comparison holds up pretty well. Think of The Evil Within as RE4 with a serious stealth component and you're mostly there. Players guide Castellanos from a third-person perspective, often with a gun drawn and a lamp bobbing nearby, skulking around environments filled with dangers. Ammunition is scarce from start to finish, making The Evil Within one of the first games to live up to the survival horror moniker in a long time. This means confrontation isn't always the preferred route. Stealth kills are one-hit affairs, and it's possible to light various objects on fire with matches to take out nearby threats, as well. Taking advantage of these and other opportunities is crucial to moving forward. You cannot shoot everything in the head here. You'll occasionally team up with Kidman and Oda in scenarios eerily reminiscent of <a href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident Evil 5</a>, but those moments are few and far between. Castellanos is on his own.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">While the game stumbles out of the gate with a series of poorly structured tutorials, it settles into a familiar pace a few hours in. It's not a good sign when a game requires hours of patience before it's worth playing, but The Evil Within turns around. In yet another nod to RE4, Castellanos comes across a quiet village that's--surprise!--hiding a bunch of enemies. This section shows The Evil Within at its best, even if it's a high point the game reaches only a few other times. It's an enormous, layered environment with ample opportunities to experiment with everything available to players: stealth, traps, guns, running, hiding, etc. There's room for failure here, but there's always a sense of danger that keeps you tense. Key to success in The Evil Within is planning, execution, and improvisation. Since you're trying to conserve ammunition, manipulating stealth and traps is essential, but an enemy might make an unexpected turn. Or another enemy shows up. Or you set off another trap. There are countless reasons a plan implodes, but The Evil Within's combat is versatile in these open environments, and players can devise new approaches.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There are times when The Evil Within derives intense anxiety from the opposite scenario, too. One harrowing sequence involves navigating a simple series of rooms and hallways with invisible enemies stalking you in the dark. A chair will get knocked across the room, announcing an enemy presence, but other than a <em>Predator</em>-like shimmer, little else reveals what's out to get you. It still gives me the creeps.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">How you approach an encounter can vary wildly, thanks to a welcomed variety in weaponry. Of course, there's the standard pistol, shotgun, and sniper rifle, but the agony bow is what's unique here. The agony bow can hold many different types of ammunition, so it changes functions on a dime. This includes bolts to send enemies flying, flash bombs to blind everyone around you (allowing for one-hit stealth kills mid-fight), freeze arrows with the ability to ice anyone within a few feet, and mines that can be placed anywhere in the world. More arrows become available as the game continues, and players both collect ammunition scattered throughout the environment and build their own by dismantling the many traps around them.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/9/93998/2694562-2014-10-22_00001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2694562\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/9/93998/2694562-2014-10-22_00001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2694562\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/9/93998/2694562-2014-10-22_00001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Those big black bars are omnipresent in The Evil Within, even during gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There are a handful of sequences when The Evil Within really clicks, the result of a designer strategically deploying his chess pieces, reflecting decades of experience. But the pacing of The Evil Within is relentless, and the creativity can't keep up. The moment you've cleared one room of enemies, there's another set around the corner. <em>Always</em>. Not all encounters are created equal, and this becomes more and more apparent as you progress. Rather than finding new scenarios in which you must develop new strategies, The Evil Within deploys more of the same with enemies requiring more bullets, creatures who can take you out in a single strike, and an endless array of boss battles meant to crush your soul.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Oh, lord, the boss battles. The Evil Within peaks early with a chainsaw-wielding maniac a la RE4 (notice a trend?), and with rare exceptions, nothing else ever comes close. What makes the chainsaw sequence work is his methodical pursuit. He lumbers forward in a way that gives you plenty of time to line up a shot, but it's not long before he's close, and you're forced to scramble away. (The other highlight, involving a dude with a safe for a head, works the same way). The Evil Within's other bosses largely involve bullet sponges capable of killing you after a single mistake. Whereas the rest of The Evil Within rewards planning, execution, and improvisation, the boss battles are little more than pumping a dog/lizard/whatever full of bullets. Castellanos isn't particularly nimble, which works just fine, since the enemies he faces aren't, either. But the bosses are capable of much more, creatures regularly lunging huge distances. It makes the battles especially frustrating, as the weighty character feels unfairly at odds with what's being asked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Did I mention you face several bosses multiple times? Did I mention the game decided to bring some of them out <em>three </em>times, as part of a boss endurance run at the very end? The bizarre design logic is capped off by an on-rails final boss battle favoring spectacle, requiring little more than holding the fire button and waiting for the ending cutscene to kick in. It's a game that often can't help itself but indulge in every whim.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2489173-e3_morgue02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2489173\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2489173-e3_morgue02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2489173\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/1/10354/2489173-e3_morgue02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/1/10354/2489173-e3_morgue02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Evil Within isn't so much scary as it is tense, but in some ways, that's more intense.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">I watched The Evil Within's cutscenes, but couldn't say what happened. Mikami's games have always been campy, convoluted affairs, and The Evil Within is no different. But it's a waste of otherwise talented actors given very little to do. Apparently, <a href=\"/tango-gameworks/3010-7035/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7035\">Tango Gameworks</a> hired <em>Dexter</em>'s Jennifer Carpenter to show up for a day's worth of work, as she voices only a handful of lines throughout the whole game. (She does, however, have her own DLC coming later.) This underscores the muddled plotting more generally, a game whose A story--genetic tampering something something bad stuff oh wait there's monsters--is what's presented in the cutscenes, while the B story--a detective driven to alcoholism by the loss of his child and, eventually, wife--is only given lip service through awkward diaries.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">It's probably worth noting the game's letterboxing at this point, too. The Evil Within's aspect ratio is 2.50:1, which translates to an extremely thick set of black bars at the top and bottom. While aesthetically unique, the game rarely leverages the aspect ratio to justify the amount of real-estate taken away from the player. Anytime you're asked to walk up or down a ladder, the bars become immensely frustrating. It's perhaps telling<a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/games/268050/announcements/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\"> a recent patch</a> for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC </a>version gives users the opportunity to flip them off entirely, providing evidence the bars have more to do with preserving technical performance than servicing a creative vision.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Speaking of the PC version, the game crashed nearly a dozen times during my 20 hours with it. <em>Hmm</em>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">It's hard for me to remember a recent game that provoked as much whiplash as The Evil Within. For every brilliant moment, there's a handful only worthy of exasperated annoyance. I haven't yelled at a TV screen and rage quit in a long time, but The Evil Within broke that streak. Congrats!

After the dull bro-shooter doldrums of <a href=\"/fuse/3030-35545/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35545\">Fuse</a>, it's great to see <a href=\"/insomniac-games/3010-1379/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1379\">Insomniac</a> getting back into its wheelhouse with a game focused on bouncing around bright, colorful environments and shooting a bunch of ridiculous weapons. Some of its gameplay concepts could stand to be a little more fleshed out, but Sunset is a high-flying good time with some clever writing and design, and a lot of gleeful attitude.</p><p style=\"\">The game is shot through with a punk rock aesthetic and sensibility that will either feel really fun or kind of dated (or both), depending on how old you are. I fell into the former category, which probably means I'm old. I mean, the game's cast features one of the members of The Melvins. How much of the game-playing youth even knows who The Melvins are at this point? Anyway, everything about the writing and visual design of Sunset Overdrive has a snarky, irreverent tone to it, as your nameless player character continually thumbs his or her nose at Fizzco, an ethically bankrupt mega-corporate beverage maker that's unleashed a new energy drink which turns all of Sunset City's residents into slobbering mutants. (It's worth noting that you don't have to play a punk type yourself--the robust character maker lets you revise your gender, face, body type, and a huge range of silly clothing options at any time.)</p><p style=\"\">The way Sunset Overdrive presents itself is absolutely top-notch. From the first minute, it combines dynamic camera work with a creative use of motion graphics and a clever self-awareness to create a lot of moments worth chuckling at. There's a worrying number of eye-rollingly flat one-liners early on that makes it feel like the game is trying too hard to be edgy, but Sunset seems to get more comfortable with its sense of humor as you get deeper in. Hearing NPCs mocking the ridiculous design tropes of open-world games, and seeing your character grab a HUD element to use as a weapon or threaten someone by popping up the radial weapon menu is always a delight. The comedy is at its best when the game is poking fun at itself, and luckily you get more of that in the latter half of the game. There are plenty of opportunities for absurdity among the various factions you meet, which include a scout troop that follows the bushido code and a group of LARPers that take their role-playing <em>very</em> seriously.</p><p style=\"\">Playing the game is about always being in motion. Nearly every object in the environment serves as a bounce pad for no particular reason, and once you're airborne, you need to find a power line, railing, or other rail-like surface to grind on as soon as possible, for two reasons. First, bouncing, grinding, and shooting enemies while doing both will build up a \"style\" meter that activates a bunch of special abilities you can customize and equip. The second you stop using the traversal mechanics, that style meter depletes rapidly, so you want to keep moving just to keep your abilities powered up.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2697349-sunset_overdrive_review_boss_fight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2697349\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2697349-sunset_overdrive_review_boss_fight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2697349\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/30/2697349-sunset_overdrive_review_boss_fight.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Seeing all the game's crazy visual tricks is a big part of the appeal here.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps more importantly, the game is balanced in a way that <em>really</em> encourages you not to be on the ground longer than you have to be. The energy drink mutants, human scavengers, and Fizzco security robots that populate the city all do enough damage to take you from full health to death fast, and their aim is good enough that you'll sponge up a ton of damage when you're on foot. The penalty for death is usually incredibly forgiving and you get a cheeky respawn animation every time, so dying isn't all that frustrating, but in general the game is more fun the faster you're moving. Early on, it feels like you don't quite have enough mobility to make it from one bounce pad or railing to the next without hitting the ground and interrupting your momentum, but the game rectifies this quickly enough by doling out more traversal abilities like an air dash that help you close the distance.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">As an Insomniac game, Sunset features a ton of weapons and upgrades to play around with, though despite an arsenal of something like 20 guns, some are more fun to shoot than others. You can equip various mods on those weapons to give them a bunch of goofy extra effects, but I still found myself sticking to only four or five weapons for the entirety of the game. The same goes for the robust character upgrade system, which includes both the amps you activate with your style meter and a second set of dozens of passive abilities to choose from. I stuck to the amps provided by the story, and found a set of passives I liked, and used those for the entirety of the game. You can rack up currency and also hunt down hundreds of collectible ingredients to upgrade those amps if you like, but everything in the game is so expensive that I didn't feel like investing the time to track down enough cash and collectibles to upgrade or swap out mods that were already working well.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">I found those half-baked systems to be a relatively minor issue since the game was plenty fun to play even without fully engaging with them. And as open-world games go, this one certainly doesn't lack for content. There are quite a few main story missions, and thankfully they frequently go beyond the baseline \"go here, kill 10 enemies, then go over there and do it again\" style of design you often see in this sort of game. There are a lot of story and side missions with neat twists on the core mechanics. The game also features some of the best boss fights in recent memory. Rather than a bunch of lumbering bullet sponges, the bosses primarily focus on making you use the traversal mechanics in some interesting ways. There are also dozens of third-tier challenge missions that are ranked by leaderboard, and you can replay main missions for par times. Between all that stuff and the zillion collectibles, there's a ton to do in here.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2697357-sunset_overdrive_review_train_shocker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2697357\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2697357-sunset_overdrive_review_train_shocker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2697357\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/30/2697357-sunset_overdrive_review_train_shocker.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/0/30/2697357-sunset_overdrive_review_train_shocker.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are enough wild weapons in here that you're sure to find a few you like shooting.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If eight-player co-op is your thing, Sunset also has that, in the form of Chaos Squad, a round-based online mode that lets you search for matches while you're running around in the single-player game. Chaos Squad has everyone racing around the map to each activity--some derived from story mechanics and some unique for this mode--and then giving everyone a cumulative score based on how well you do. At the end of a match, your point totals feed into some slot-machine-like random drops that give you extra money or weapon buffs to take with you back into the main game. Chaos Squad is a decent diversion if you get bored of the regular open world, and it's nice that it offers some benefits that persist outside the multiplayer, but it's not something I found myself coming back to repeatedly. The story mode is the main draw here.</p><p style=\"\">This is an great debut for Insomniac on a new console, and it's great to see the developer of Ratchet &amp; Clank getting back to a lot of colorful nonsense after focusing on Fuse and Resistance for so long.

So the developers of <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a> took their considerable prowess in creating a cinematic first-person shooter and delivered <a href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2133\">Modern Warfare</a>. The fourth game in the main COD line, MW reset expectations for competitive console shooters while giving players access to, well, modern weaponry. But you can only shoot <a href=\"/m16a4/3055-339/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-339\">M-16</a>s and <a href=\"/ak-47/3055-187/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-187\">AK-47</a>s for so long. They might not ping like the old M1 does, but over time and annual sequels, the \"modern\" conflicts quickly ran out of history and headlines for developers to pull guns and conflicts from. The developers of Call of Duty pushed on into the realm of \"near future,\" where plausible weapons that could be in our military's hands soon were ushered into the eager-yet-virtual hands of <a href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\">Team Deathmatch</a> and <a href=\"/control-point/3015-187/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-187\">Domination</a> players around the world. That leads us to today. <a href=\"/sledgehammer-games/3010-6917/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6917\">Sledgehammer</a>'s first full attempt to develop a Call of Duty game is called \"<a href=\"/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/3030-45359/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-45359\">Advanced Warfare</a>.\"</p><p style=\"\">By invoking the same sort of naming convention used by Modern Warfare, you get the feeling that they're trying to send a message. A message that this is new, and that it's perhaps meant to serve as a fresh start for a series that badly needs one. The resulting product is one that, yes, is still a Call of Duty game. The new, further-in-the-future-than-our-last-near-future guns are fun to play with. But the most meaningful change involves how you move your soldier around the battlefield. It probably won't be enough to drag in new players or pull in those who have written this type of game off entirely, but it's also the freshest thing to happen to Call of Duty since they decided to let you start shooting down <a href=\"/unmanned-aerial-vehicle/3055-3350/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3350\">UAV</a>s.</p><p style=\"\">The movement comes via a metal \"exo suit\" that the characters wear on their bodies. This lets you quickly dash sideways, forwards, and backwards. It lets you use an assisted <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">double jump</a> that helps you get up to high ground quickly and efficiently. And it lets you pound down onto the heads of your foes from above with a powerful but tricky-to-aim slam. It probably doesn't sound like much, but being able to get around the map more quickly and change your elevation with ease actually makes a huge difference. In single-player, it gives you new options and abilities to play with during a fun campaign with a story that would feel right at home in a typical, mindless summer blockbuster. In competitive multiplayer, being able to boost around corners to avoid incoming fire or dropping down off of rooftops and boosting behind an enemy feels outstanding. It's fun to shoot boosting enemies out of the sky, too, and overall, the boost jumps bring elevation into play more frequently than it's been in most of the past games in the franchise. Now that it's easier to get up there and you don't find yourself quietly loping up staircases or climbing ladders that leave you totally vulnerable, the battles end up feeling a bit more dynamic and faster-paced than before. The multiplayer maps are designed around your mobility and the whole thing fits together really well.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2693396-advanced-warfare-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2693396\" style=\"width: 3840px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2693396-advanced-warfare-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2693396\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/18/187968/2693396-advanced-warfare-2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Advanced Warfare is a better-looking game than its predecessors, with some special attention paid to facial animations.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As before, Advanced Warfare is split up into three distinct modes. The campaign is another six-hour romp through a war-torn world. It's straightforward as ever, which is a little disappointing considering the series did better with player choice and branching in the campaign back in <a href=\"/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii/3030-38039/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38039\">Black Ops II</a>. It also delves into the same sort of \"<a href=\"/private-military-company/3015-3535/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3535\">Private Military Companies</a> behaving badly\" story beats that every other piece of fiction about modern or future combat seems to these days. Despite some incredibly corny moments (including a button prompt that may replace <a href=\"/homefront/3030-26633/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26633\">Homefront</a>'s \"Jump in Mass Grave\" as the world's goofiest button prompt), the campaign is engaging and offers a somewhat more interesting story than the series typically delivers. Part of that comes from <a href=\"/kevin-spacey/3040-109814/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-109814\">Kevin Spacey</a>, who plays Jonathan Irons, the founder of Atlas Corporation, the PMC in question. The game benefits a lot from Spacey's performance, which looks extremely realistic in cutscenes and only slightly less realistic in-game. He delivers the kinds of speeches you'd expect and delivers them extremely well. You also get a fair amount of dialogue from Spacey's Irons as the game's unlockable intel, giving you insight into what his character was thinking over the course of the game. It's a strong performance that brings the rest of the proceedings up a notch, which isn't something you can say very often about film or TV actors when they appear in video games.</p><p style=\"\">There's an upgrade system built into the campaign that lets you earn points by reaching milestones in number of kills, <a href=\"/headshot/3015-85/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-85\">headshots</a>, grenade kills, and laptops collected. These points can be spent on things like increased health, the ability to aim down your sights more quickly, have more battery power for your exo suit's abilities, and so on. It's not a huge feature, but it gives you a reason to at least think about using the game's smart grenades or keeping an eye open for those intel laptops.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Advanced Warfare's multiplayer offers most of the modes and options you've come to expect from the franchise. The shooting and weapon handling all feel as you'd expect them to, but the use of the game's exo suits really change things up. Suddenly, Call of Duty is even more about fighting from the rooftops, because you can quickly double-tap your jump button to get up there. Changing your elevation and moving around at faster speeds than you could previously makes the whole game feel more active without making the whole thing feel too biased in favor of players who stay on the move. Most of your boost jumps and dashes have a short window where you're just sort of hanging out in the air, so boosting around carelessly is a surefire way to get gunned down out of the sky over and over again.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2629167-029168.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2629167\" style=\"width: 2000px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2000\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2629167-029168.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2629167\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/9493/2629167-029168.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/9493/2629167-029168.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>This year's Call of Duty does \"quiet\" better than previous games have, which makes for a more varied pace than you typically get.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You'll also have an \"exo ability\" slot, which replaces tactical grenades. These are short-use things like Overclock, which gives you a termporary speed boost, or Hover, which makes it far easier for you to get shot out of the air over and over again. There's also a Cloak, in case you're playing against people who haven't already adjusted to seeing and shooting at <i>Predator</i>-style cloaked characters in video games. Overall, I found the exo abilities to be almost totally useless.</p><p style=\"\">Classes, which can be customized right out of the gate, are built using a spin on the \"Pick 10\" system first implemented in Black Ops II. This is a highly customizable system that lets you do things like opt out of carrying a second weapon in order to, say, carry more attachments for your primary weapon or enable more perks. Advanced Warfare uses a \"Pick 13\" system that gives you three more points to spend and also brings scorestreak bonuses, like UAVs and care package drops, into the system. So, if you're the sort of player who never survives long enough to call in any of the cooler streaks, just remove them from your class and carry more cool stuff. It's a smart update to the system and it'd be nice to see the series stick with something along these lines for awhile. It's nicely flexible.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Unlike last year's <a href=\"/call-of-duty-ghosts/3030-41520/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41520\">Ghosts</a>, the unlocking of weapons, perks, and attachments all come at a set pace and in a set order. There are no squad points to spend and attachments come from you using the gun effectively. You'll unlock a red dot sight for most weapons after getting 20 kills with it, for example. This leads to a situation where some of your level increases unlock things you have no desire to use, but the level ramp has been reset back to level 50, and I felt like I had most of what I needed to effectively build my kind of class at around level 17. You'll also unlock the ability to customize your scorestreaks, which is a cool idea. This means you can turn your regular UAV into an orbital UAV that can't be shot down. Or your sentry gun can fire rockets instead of bullets. Or you can flip any of them to \"support,\" which means that points earned towards your streaks stay with you after you die. The catch is that these upgrades make the streaks more expensive.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2693397-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer-screenshots-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2693397\" style=\"width: 3840px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/18/187968/2693397-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer-screenshots-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2693397\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/18/187968/2693397-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer-screenshots-7.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/18/187968/2693397-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer-screenshots-7.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>These ridiculous dual chainguns can be planted into the ground for additional control, but multiplayer moves so fast that standing still doesn't seem like such a great idea.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Mode-wise, Advanced Warfare has most of what you'd expect to see and a couple of new options. Team Deathmatch and Domination seem to rule the day, but you can get into Kill Confirmed, Hardpoint, Search &amp; Destroy, CTF, and plenty of others. Personally, I still miss Headquarters, though I suppose Hardpoint is similar enough. Uplink is a new mode that turns the game into basketball or soccer with guns. A ball-shaped satellite spawns at a set point on the map and two goals are placed roughly at either end of the map. Players need to grab the ball and either run or toss it into the floating goal at the opposing team's end of the map. You can pass the ball around and, if you like, you can accomplish melee kills while holding it. It's fast-paced and fun, with the exo boosts and jumps giving it a more frenetic feel than it'd have otherwise. Momentum is a renamed \"War\" mode, which appeared in <a href=\"/treyarch/3010-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1488\">Treyarch</a>'s early Call of Duty games. Five capture points are set across the map and they must be taken in a set order. The two teams attempt to push back and forth across the five flags until one team controls them all.</p><p style=\"\">In addition to building your class out, you can also cosmetically alter your character with various shirts, shoes, pants, armor, and so on. The list feels a little restrictive, but grows as you acquire \"supply drops.\" These seem to randomly pop as you're playing multiplayer, and, after a match, a drop turns into three items. Many of these are new ways to dress up your soldier, but you'll also get weapon variants. These take existing weapons and slightly alter their stats. So you might find a submachine gun that drops rate of fire by one point but raises your mobility by two, for example. Or a rifle that forces a silencer on you in addition to altering other stats. You also find more ephemeral things, like a short period of doubled <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience point</a> gain or a one-time orbital drop that activates a few minutes into your next match. You probably won't be able to have everything unlocked at once, which is a little frustrating. Items fit into your character's armory, which maxes out at just over 80 slots. If you end up with items you don't like, you can scrap them, which turns them into bonus XP. You'll also occasionally earn something called the Bloodshed Helmet, which can't be scrapped and expires after 30 minutes of in-game use, which just reverts you back to the default look once it expires. Expiring cosmetic items comes off like a really dumb idea, but the vast majority of items that enter your armory will stay until you decide to junk them.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The co-op mode in Advanced Warfare is called Exo Survival, and it puts you and up to three other players onto the multiplayer maps for a little <a href=\"/horde-mode/3015-3021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">wave-based survival</a>.

The image quality, overall, is sharper and more defined. Whereas Ghosts would bog down on <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>, Advanced Warfare is typically more stable and capable of staying up around that magical 60 frames-per-second mark. It's not some world-changing difference that's going to make you rethink what game consoles are capable of in 2014, but it's a solid increase all around when you compare it to the franchise's last entry. It looks and performs largely similarly across both Xbox One and PlayStation 4, though I continue to prefer the PS4's controller for shooters. Meanwhile the PC version is, obviously, capable of running at a higher resolution. It looks sharp also gives you more video options than most PC games seem to these days.</p><p style=\"\">Advanced Warfare doesn't reinvent Call of Duty. It's not the same dramatic shift that we saw when the series went from World War II to the modern era. Perhaps holding out hope for something as revolutionary as Modern Warfare was when it hit back in 2007 is foolish. Be that as it may, as someone who has been drifting further and further away from Call of Duty for the past few years, I can certainly say that Advanced Warfare's mobility kept me interested much longer than Ghosts or Black Ops II has. It's the best multiplayer the game has seen in some time and the whole thing totals up to a satisfying, if familiar experience.</p>", "deck": "Advanced Warfare's increased focus on player mobility makes a huge impact that freshens up the action and, in some ways, makes every other game in the franchise feel obsolete by comparison.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-683/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-45359/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/3030-45359/", "id": 45359, "name": "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-11-03 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-134228/", "id": 134228, "name": "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/nba-2k15-review/1900-684/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Here is a fact that, regrettably, did not make it into my reviews of <a href=\"/nba-2k14/3030-42632/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42632\">NBA 2K14</a> last year. As good of a basketball simulation as that game was, its online servers were also, for many players, practically unusable for long stretches of time. I did not run into many of those issues when testing the game myself for review, but they became the predominant topic of conversation in the ensuing months. <a href=\"/2k-sports/3010-1860/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1860\">2K Sports</a>' reputation with online gameplay is a spotty thing, at best. 2K14 was not the first game in this series to suffer from busted servers, and unfortunately, it wasn't the last.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/141373/2677733-8244775764-14091.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2677733\" style=\"width: 1300px\" data-ratio=\"0.48\" data-width=\"1300\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/141373/2677733-8244775764-14091.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2677733\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/14/141373/2677733-8244775764-14091.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You won't find a better looking or better playing basketball game on the market today, but NBA 2K15 regrettably still comes with its share of technical hassles. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/nba-2k15/3030-45334/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-45334\">NBA 2K15</a> is another very good basketball game that nonetheless floats between being mildly afflicted and utterly crippled by server issues. Some of its worst problems have begun to work themselves out in the time following its release, but many issues--including laggy online games, server timeouts in modes that in theory are supposed to be offline, and a clunky, barely enjoyable MyPark mode--still remain. There are likable improvements in this year's offering, but not nearly enough of them to make up for what an unfriendly experience the game often proves to be.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame, because on the court, NBA 2K15 is just about as good as this series has ever been. Not a lot has been changed in terms of controls, but A.I. has seen a significant overhaul, one that's most noticeable in defense. Shots that I had an easy time exploiting in last year's game are far more difficult to pull off, and defenders play you much tighter than in the past. Offensively, the only big new addition is a shot meter that appears below your player. The idea with this thing is to give you an idea where a player's best shot range tends to be, and when the correct time to release is. It's handy, I suppose, but it can also be distracting if you're not used to looking down at a meter when shooting. Once you do become accustomed to it, the meter does become a useful guide for improving your shot quality, though thankfully, it doesn't make every shot you take automatic, either.</p><p style=\"\">Granted, the gameplay has always been NBA 2K's best feature, so it not seeing any major upgrades isn't a huge deal. That said, there are some strange issues I've seen creep up in modes outside of just offline exhibition matches. When playing games in MyPlayer or MyGM mode, I've often found that shots I would normally make with relative ease would just start missing late in games, seemingly out of nowhere. I'm talking about open looks, clean runs through the paint to make a layup, with only the lightest contact with defenders. The kind of stuff you just shouldn't miss. I've also run into a frequent issue in online match-ups with defenses suddenly just forgetting how to rebound. Over the course of several games, I watched repeatedly as defenders surrounding the basket just stared as the ball banked off the glass or the rim, and bounced right to the ground with no one making a move on it. The online game has its share of lag, but this seemed more like A.I. simply finding itself unable to process what it was supposed to do in that situation. I never saw this happen once in any offline game, but it happened quite a bit when competing online.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">This is, of course, assuming you can even get online. Though the problems as of this writing are nowhere near as prevalent as they were the week of launch, I've still found online gameplay and matchmaking to be hit-or-miss. If I'm not just getting booted out of the menu due to a server disconnect, I'm still running into laggy games that negate a lot of the fun of playing basketball against other people.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">What's bizarre is that those server issues have managed to plague purportedly offline modes as well. At various points, I've found myself booted out of the MyPlayer mode because the game uses the online servers to keep track of the VC (virtual currency) you earn throughout the mode. There would be moments where I'd be stuck on the player upgrade screen, unable to do anything while the server would endlessly try to calculate how much VC I would need to spend on my next upgrade package. That's insane. I understand that part of how 2K makes money on these games is by selling VC, and this is likely an anti-piracy measure, but if the servers can't handle having to do those checks on a regular basis, that's not very helpful for anyone. Again, those issues have become considerably less frequent in recent days, but I'll still occasionally run into situations where I can't even get into MyPlayer because the servers just won't connect.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2698486-2689993-cp_nba2k15_ql.mp4.still001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2698486\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2698486-2689993-cp_nba2k15_ql.mp4.still001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2698486\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2698486-2689993-cp_nba2k15_ql.mp4.still001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>NBA 2K15's face-scanning technology is capable of producing both fairly accurate representations of your face, and abominable horrors. I'll leave it to you to decide where this scan of our own Vinny Caravella falls. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's sad, because the MyPlayer mode is NBA 2K15's best feature. It builds on the story ideas pitched in the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> versions of last year's game, letting you create your own rookie and taking him on a journey through the NBA that starts on the very bottom rung of the league. Where last year's game presented you as a draftable potential superstar, this year's instead has you as an undrafted free agent, forced to move from 10-day contract to 10-day contract until finally latching on with a team. On each team you join, one of the star players will frequently speak to and mentor you, and this time around those players actually voice their on-screen characters. It's a nice touch that is undercut a bit by the fact that none of these players have much voice acting experience. It's great to hear DeMarcus Cousins and Al Horford actually speak to you, but their flat delivery doesn't do much for immersing you in the experience.</p><p style=\"\">Voice acting isn't the only immersion breaker. Last year's MyPlayer mode had a ton of cutscene repetition, so much that you'd see characters commenting on the same person's birthday coming up four times in the same season. This year's game is less repetitive, but you'll still see cutscenes repeat a bit too often. In my first season, I got the \"players have been traded, coach introduces you to your new teammates\" scene three different times. Repetition and continuity issues--say, having Doc Rivers join your team as coach, then having a different coach character model pop up in every mid-game locker room scene--are just a bit too prevalent to ignore. It's also a shame that there's not more room for nuance in how you portray your character. You'll frequently get dialogue prompts during conversations, press conferences, and the like, but those dialogue options never really branch out beyond \"saintly team player\" and \"egotistical jerk.\" Lacking any room to maneuver in-between those two extremes, these moments of choice end up not feeling like much of a choice at all.</p><p style=\"\">One of the biggest changes to NBA 2K15 is how you go about making your player character. In addition to the usual character editing tools, you now have the ability to use the Kinect or PlayStation 4 camera to scan your own face into the game. Unfortunately, its effectiveness is...well, <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k15s-face-scans-resulting-in-terrifyingly-hil/1100-6422799/\" data-ref-id=\"1100-6422799\">you've probably already seen for yourself</a>. For my part, I was able to get a face scanned on the PlayStation 4 with relative ease in my well-lit living room. In less naturally-lit rooms, I found myself messing with lighting and positioning for upwards of two hours just to get something that looked halfway human. Worse still, early on in my testing, the game frequently would lose my face scans. Or if not the scan itself, all of the head shaping/hairstyles/facial hair options I had set. I'd have to re-do the scan or re-morph the head to make it look correct again. 2K says it's fixed this issue, and in recent testing, this has not reoccurred. It hasn't made the scanning tech any less finicky, though, and<a href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/30/7134899/nba-2k15-facial-scans-halloween-masks\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\"> 2K's recent social media ribbing</a> over the quirkiness of the tech doesn't exactly give one the impression that they think the issue is on their end.</p><p style=\"\">Apart from the MyPlayer story mode, you can also bring your created character into the MyPark mode. Here, you'll choose an affiliation with one of three factions, then find yourself wandering around a park full of basketball courts to play some pick-up games. That is, of course, assuming you can get into a pick-up game at all. MyPark is the mode I found to be most beleaguered by connection issues. When it was at its worst, I'd get thrown out to the main menu at random, or get disconnected mid-game, which results in you being forced to watch your now A.I.-controlled character finish the online game before you can move on to another one. When the mode actually does function, it's still not very much fun. To get into games, you have to stand on the blacktop in a \"got next\" area, and wait for a game to finish before you can get into the next one. I might not have minded this so much if my average wait time for a game wasn't between 10-15 minutes--and much, much longer once I graduated to games played in the other, more advanced venues--which is longer than most of the games you'll actually be playing early on in MyPark.</p><p style=\"\">Other bugs and quirks pop up throughout offline portions of the game, as well. While NBA 2K15 looks and moves just as spectacularly as last year's game, it seems more prone to visual and audio bugs than its predecessor. Halftime and post-game interviews with players and coaches are handled using audio from real game interviews, but sometimes that audio simply doesn't load, or, more hilariously, one of the character models won't load, leaving poor Doris Burke to interview a ghost. In other interviews, a random player or coach would wander into frame and block most of the screen. Other bugs are a bit less over-the-top. You'll run into overly long breaks between inbounds that you can't skip through (which I'll just guess is a mask for in-game load times), and sometimes you'll hear commentary fly off the handle over plays that aren't exactly barn-burners. Few of these bugs are especially game-breaking, though one issue that has driven me up the wall is load times. Games and modes typically take a good long while to load up, though how long they take is wildly inconsistent, ranging from merely kind of long to infuriatingly so.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2670010-032887.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2670010\" style=\"width: 960px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9493/2670010-032887.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2670010\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/9493/2670010-032887.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/9493/2670010-032887.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>I know I already said it earlier, but jeez, this game really does look pretty incredible.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The MyGM mode is, at least, mostly free of any major issues. MyGM offers up a great deal more interaction with your staff, players, and owner this year, and mercifully, the mode is generous about awarding XP for every action you take. That XP translates into bonuses you can spread across the players on your team, player scouting, contract negotiations, and even your relationship with your team's owner. The dialogue written for this year's mode is also considerably better, and less repetitive than in last year's version. A more simplified MyLeague mode lets you play through a team's season without most of the administrative busywork, and online leagues do return in this year's game, albeit in limited, and only sporadically functional form.</p><p style=\"\">When it works, NBA 2K15 is every bit as good as this series is capable of being. The gameplay is deep and rewarding, and its modes offer a wealth of ways to play. But that great game is frequently smothered by issues with functionality. Its best modes are too often hobbled by reliance on 2K's junky servers, and bugs and design flaws are too prevalent to ignore. NBA 2K15 still offers the most realistic version of the game of basketball you'll find on any platform this year. It's just a shame that players will have to struggle against its shoddy infrastructure in order to get the most out of that experience.</p>", "deck": "The deep and challenging gameplay this series is known for is still front and center, but NBA 2K15's myriad technical problems put a damper on the experience.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-684/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-45334/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k15/3030-45334/", "id": 45334, "name": "NBA 2K15"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2014-11-05 09:14:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-138059/", "id": 138059, "name": "NBA 2K15"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/nba-live-15-review/1900-685/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"/nba-live-15/3030-46521/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46521\">NBA Live 15</a> is a better game than <a href=\"/nba-live-14/3030-42864/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42864\">NBA Live 14</a>. That's not really saying much, as NBA Live 14 was a trainwreck. Of course you would hope NBA Live 15 would manage to improve on Live 14's stilted, unintuitive gameplay and emaciated game modes. It's not a huge improvement, more of a baby step toward something more closely resembling a real basketball simulation than a recommendable game in its own right.

Live 14 was an unwieldy mess to play, a fact bolstered by the game's general lack of useful tutorials. Live 15 finally appends a proper tutorial to its game, and it's a helpful one. It gave me a good handle on the core offensive controls. I learned I could now set a pick by holding down the left trigger, which calls over a teammate to set the screen. I learned how to pull off freestyle passes by holding down the right bumper and flicking the right stick, figured out the new shot meter, and got a decent handle on dribbling moves before I even made it into my first game.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, once you're actually in a game of NBA Live 15, you learn quickly that most of the stuff you've learned either isn't that important, or just doesn't work quite right. Calling for screens calls a player over reliably, but it's not often they're able to get themselves into proper position for a useable screen. Driving to the net for a layup results in you pulling up for a jump shot instead with annoying frequency. The new shot meter is useful enough for figuring out where a player's ideal range for a shot is, but isn't reliable for determining whether a shot is contested or not. Live 15's definition of a \"contested shot\" is pretty much just \"is there a defender standing in your general vicinity.\" Even if you've got a couple of feet of space between you, going for a shot with a defender anywhere in your orbit leads to more misses than seems reasonable, especially with star players who routinely make tough shots past defenders in real life.</p><p style=\"\">Yet if you can get far enough away from a defender, it's also incredibly easy to drain threes and jumpers once you nail down the game's shot timing. Early on I was missing shots with great frequency, until I realized that Live 15's shots require a release much earlier than I was used to. You've got to let go of the shot button quickly if you want to be successful, and that timing becomes even more unforgiving on higher difficulty levels. The only indicator you have that tells you whether you're shooting correctly or not is a little text prompt at the top of the screen that lets you know if you're shooting early or late. There's no visual indicator on the court to show when you've timed a shot correctly or not, and the animation of your player taking his shot has nothing to do with the proper timing. If you're used to watching your player to figure out the right time to release the button, you're going find yourself confused initially.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/141373/2677722-8853793629-Bwiya3BIUAAYL8e.png%3Alarge\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2677722\" data-ratio=\"0.5576171875\" data-width=\"1024\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/14/141373/2677722-8853793629-Bwiya3BIUAAYL8e.png%3Alarge\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2677722\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/14/141373/2677722-8853793629-Bwiya3BIUAAYL8e.png%3Alarge\"></a><figcaption>Live hasn't quite gotten to NBA 2K levels of visual realism, but the player models are a big improvement this year.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Still, problems aside, NBA Live 15 is an eminently more playable game of basketball than last year's game. Animation problems that plagued the pace of Live 14 are largely corrected here. Yes, there are still a lot of wonky-looking animations--players warping around the court unnaturally, balls flying in unnatural directions, players clipping through one another with too great of frequency--but few of those issues impact gameplay. Fast breaks actually work, player movement is considerably more responsive, and while you'll see some truly boneheaded plays on the court--guys going for shots from behind the basket, A.I. players just kind of standing around until you force them to move using the left bumper, etc.--they're not a constant, game-breaking issue.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That said, NBA Live 15 ultimately serves better as a functional, if not overly exciting arcade basketball experience, versus a simulation of the real sport. Defense is something the game barely even tries to address, and while the controls are tight enough to keep a decent handle on an opposing ball-handler, it's extremely easy to exploit A.I. defenses with the same basic shots over and over. Where defense does work, it's arguably <em>too</em> effective. Steals and blocks are remarkably easy to pull off, to the point where I was having 15-20 steals a game in games with five minute quarters. NBA Live 15 can be a bit of fun when playing against a friend, especially if you like high scoring, fast-paced games. Playing against the A.I., though, is dreadful. Bumping up the difficulty makes the A.I. no less exploitable, nor any less prone to just standing around, waiting for something to happen when you aren't actively directing it.</p><p style=\"\">NBA Live 15 is also a pretty bare bones game in terms of modes. Dynasty mode still offers up an extremely no-frills take on a franchise mode. You can do all the basics--trades, free agent signing, rookie scouting--and you'll get some very basic goals to achieve throughout the season, but that's about it. Rising Star is Live 15's single-player career mode, and it's similarly lacking. I wasn't necessarily expecting the Live team to pull off a fully fleshed-out, story-focused career mode like NBA 2K's MyPlayer, but it's still disappointing how little there really is to this mode. The create-a-player function is highly limited in options, and once your player is drafted into the league, not a whole lot happens. You get some nuggets of instruction from your coach during games, and you're graded using a points system similar to 2K's, but how it grades you is sometimes suspect. Getting docked points for missing a contested shot with a couple of seconds left on the shot clock doesn't feel exactly fair, for instance.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2698489-nbalive15_header_gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2698489\" data-ratio=\"0.56235294117647\" data-width=\"850\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 850px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2698489-nbalive15_header_gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2698489\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2698489-nbalive15_header_gameplay.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2698489-nbalive15_header_gameplay.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>On-the-court gameplay has improved quite a bit, but it's still more of an arcade-flavored experience than anything remotely sim-like.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Ultimate Team has received an auction house for players to sell and buy cards from one another, but is otherwise pretty much the exact same mode as last year. Big Moments and Rewind modes offer quick recreations of big play moments from last year's season, and repeats of full games from this season, respectively. Both are neat ideas that aren't terribly exciting in practice, especially the big moments, which lack the energy and excitement of the real life game moments. Online modes include basic head-to-head play, best of seven series, and a head-to-head \"season\" mode that only lasts for 10 games.

I've been tasked with assassinating a shadowy figure who has key information pertaining to the game's overarching conspiracy. He's meeting with associates in a barely lit cemetery, surrounded by enemy guards. Initially I begin to creep around, picking off scattered guards here and there, but then he begins to move and I worry that I'm going to lose him if I don't make my play quickly. So, I descend to the ground and try to find a good position to sneak up on my target. I use the new cover snap ability to press up against a low wall, and wait for him to approach. Then, suddenly, a guard I hadn't noticed from the opposite side sees me. He comes running at me, which alerts my target's bodyguards. I try to hastily leap over the wall to grab him, but the cover mechanic doesn't let me do that. Instead, I have to jump out of cover, then run back at the wall to go after him. At this point guards are running in from all sides. Out of pure instinct, I toss down a smoke grenade, which sends every enemy into fits of coughing. Walking through the smoke, I approach my target and shank him, which results in a cutscene made up of the target's scattered memories. I watch, and wait for my chance to make my escape. When the scene ends, I am returned to gameplay, and turn to make my retreat. There are an awful lot of guards though, so I throw another smoke grenade and thin their ranks a bit, which I am able to do with surprising quickness. By the time I'm down to just a couple of guards, I'm about ready to exit the area, only to have the game hard lock on me. I get to do all of this over again, including watching the cutscene, which is unskippable.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/2646423-0x600-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2646423\" data-ratio=\"0.56285178236398\" data-width=\"1066\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1066px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/2646423-0x600-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2646423\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/17537/2646423-0x600-2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed has never looked better than it does in Unity, but those looks aren't enough to make up for its many technical problems.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is the story of Assassin's Creed: Unity, a game that presents a number of tantalizing possibilities for top-flight stealth action gameplay, and manages to kneecap them at almost every turn through problematic design choices and endless technical woes. Unity is a game of great breadth and beauty. The first of the series targeted at the current generation of consoles, Unity plops you down in the middle of the French Revolution, presenting a vision of <a href=\"/paris/3035-487/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-487\">Paris</a> enormous in scope and bursting with seething unrest. Yet so much of that revolution seems to be happening away from you as you navigate the streets and rooftops of the city, plugging away at a plot that's far more preoccupied with a boilerplate revenge story than the violent political upheaval unfolding all around you. Unity is packed tighter with missions, side ventures, and collectible doo-dads than any Assassin's Creed before it, but so little of it is truly of interest, giving the game a weighed-down feel as you try to figure out what's worth pursuing, and what's merely a distraction. And while there are moments of genuine awe in Unity, almost all of them are visual in nature. This is by far the most incredible looking game in this series, with landmarks and characters rendered in unbelievable detail--<em>when</em> they're properly rendered, of course. The most enjoyment I managed to wring from Unity was in darting and weaving my way through the city, taking in the sights and marveling at what upgraded technology could offer this long-running series. When it came to actually playing Unity as it was intended, I found myself most often shaking my head in disappointment.</p><p style=\"\">There are a good number of ways in which Unity fails to deliver, but let's start with its story, which is nonsense. And not just the usual brand of nonsense this series deals in, either. As <a href=\"/arno-dorian/3005-29590/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29590\">Arno Dorian</a>, the son of a felled assassin raised by a templar, you are thrust into the middle of an increasingly ludicrous conspiracy when the aforementioned templar is also murdered. Arno is accused of the killing, sent to La Bastille prison, meets an incarcerated assassin who knew his father, and hastily joins up with the brotherhood with aims toward solving those murders. In the vein of <a href=\"/edward-kenway/3005-25756/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25756\">Edward Kenway</a>, <a href=\"/assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag/3030-41518/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41518\">Assassin's Creed IV</a>'s protagonist, Arno's goals have little to do with the creed he swears fealty to. He's a self-interested assassin, which is a story that can be done well, as evidenced by IV's surprisingly enjoyable romp through the world of Caribbean piracy. That game also had a lightness to its story that Unity rarely displays. Arno is initially presented as a bit of a roguish prick, but that incorrigible charm almost entirely disappears the second he joins up with the Brotherhood, giving way to a deathly self-seriousness.</p><p style=\"\">Arno makes some exceedingly poor choices over the course of Unity's main story, but he's not the worst protagonist this series has ever had. The bigger issue is that the conspiracy he finds himself investigating is horrendously plotted. You spend the game darting from target to target, and each killing presents you with another rung on the conspiratorial ladder you must climb. Throughout the story, the writers show a careless lack of interest in contextualizing these targets for you. Sure, you can pull up the game's database and read up on each one if you like, but the in-game story is in a constant hurry to get you to the next scene. Just a day after finishing the game, I'm struggling to even remember half the targets I killed, or what their role in the conspiracy amounted to. Killing them also no longer nets you the confessional conversations you'd get in games past, just a series of hastily edited cutscenes that present pieces of the puzzle Arno aims to solve. Even the characters that come late in the game, the ones that are seemingly built up to be rivals of note for Arno, are barely established by the time you get around to offing them.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Unity's attempts at marrying its historical setting to that story are similarly lacking. It's not that Assassin's Creed games should go out of their way to make you a key figure in every noteworthy event that takes place in their respective worlds--see <a href=\"/assassins-creed-iii/3030-37494/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37494\">Assassin's Creed III</a> for an example of that sort of thing going too far--but Unity is uniquely bad at making its history work in concert with the assassins' and templars' blood feud. When it does dabble in historical tourism, it has Arno interacting with key figures of the time, including the depraved Marquis de Sade, the corrupted revolutionary Robespierre, and a young, brashly ambitious <a href=\"/napoleon-bonaparte/3005-2192/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2192\">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. But every time one of these characters appears, they disappear from the proceedings almost immediately. By the time the game starts winding to its conclusion, some attempts are made to place Arno and his antagonists into the mix of the revolution taking place, but they are, at best, fleeting nods to history. What a shame this is. That I am able to meet a character as memorable as the Marquis de Sade, and all I can recall from those encounters is a brief mention of fornication with goats, is emblematic of how utterly disinterested Unity is in its historical personalities.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/2646424-0x600-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2646424\" data-ratio=\"0.56285178236398\" data-width=\"1066\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1066px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/2646424-0x600-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2646424\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1/17537/2646424-0x600-3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Assassination missions feature more freedom to explore than in previous games, yet it's depressingly easy to brute force your way through most combat scenarios.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Instead, it wants to keep you focused on this confusingly lame murder mystery, which you are only involved with at the behest of modern day assassins. Yes, Unity does again flirt with the modern-day version of the assassins/templars feud, but it's even less involving than the scaled-back version found in AC IV. IV's conceit of you playing as a low-level game developer at evil corporation <a href=\"/abstergo-industries/3015-2653/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2653\">Abstergo</a>'s entertainment wing is abandoned in favor of you just being some schmuck playing through one of the company's games. Assassin hackers jack into Abstergo's not-Matrix, spout some stuff about tracking down another sage, and then you're on about your revenge murdering mostly unencumbered by any involvement from the \"real world.\" When those hackers do pop up again, it's solely to harangue you into diving through a portal to avoid Abstergo security sweeps. This sends you into one of three different alternate time periods, hopping around a still-under-construction Statue of Liberty or a German-occupied Eiffel Tower during World War II.</p><p style=\"\">These missions really don't make a lot of sense, outside of getting you to experience landmarks that didn't exist during the time period the game primarily takes place in. They're harmless diversions, but aren't any more interesting than the typical traversal missions this series has been doing for ages. Yet, by virtue of being so out of left field, they're still more interesting than most of what Unity has you doing the bulk of the time. I'm hesitant to say that Assassin's Creed's gameplay is merely tired. If anything, AC IV demonstrated that with some key design changes, the well-worn tropes of the series could still be fashioned into something fresh-feeling. But Unity doesn't have much that sets it apart from the games that came before it, outside of pure size considerations.</p><p style=\"\">Unity feels like a throwback to the days of <a href=\"/ezio-auditore-da-firenze/3005-10269/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10269\">Ezio</a> and <a href=\"/altair-ibn-laahad/3005-48/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-48\">Altair</a>, and not often in a good way. Missions generally feature the same basic mix of assassinating, eavesdropping, and hasty parkour fans should be well familiar with. Assassinations dabble in more elaborate methods of killing than the usual ceiling drops of doom, but those possibilities are often unnecessary, especially later in the game. Early on, Arno is armed with weak enough weapons that stealth is an important consideration. The first couple of targets I felled pushed me to find paths away from other enemies, resulting in some decently creative kills. But after a few missions under my belt, I collected enough money to purchase an upgraded sword that did considerably more damage. Combined with the upgradable equipment you can deck Arno out in--each of which comes with combinable bonuses that boost your attacks, health, and item storage--I accidentally turned Arno into a near-unstoppable killing machine less than a third of the way through the story.</p><p style=\"\">I did this by partaking in the game's theater missions. This is one of several different side-quest types, though this one is especially noteworthy for its ability to break the game's economy. By doing missions for the owner of this theater, you're able to upgrade the initially rundown building into a bustling business, which nets you regular deliveries of in-game currency. Each upgrade boosts that number, until eventually you're earning huge chunks of change in relatively short amounts of time, allowing you to buy new items with abandon. By my third assassination mission, I had gotten Arno to the point where he could obliterate groups of enemies with a single smoke bomb and a handful of sword swings. This is not in keeping with the game's notion of stealthy, carefully-planned assassination, but Unity rarely finds ways to protest against such a play style. Only in the last few missions of the game did the scenarios presented force me to pay attention to things like guard patrol routes and available architecture in order to succeed. For most of the game, I was able to easily jump around, throwing smoke bombs and slicing up enemies without care. Alarm bells that should have sent me scurrying to the rooftops instead just forced me to use an extra smoke bomb or two that I could easily replace.</p><p style=\"\">This is unfortunate, because I like the core idea behind these weapon and equipment upgrades. Apart from the pleasing idea of customizing your assassin in a variety of outfits, the assortment of weapons gives you a chance to experiment with attack styles that best suit your needs. But by the time I got around to having that opportunity to experiment, I'd already found a weapon that could obliterate most enemies in a couple of button presses. All of this without ever resorting to Unity's microtransactions, which are specifically geared toward making weapons and equipment cheaper. Why bother when the in-game economy keeps me flush with cash on a near-constant basis?</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/2646425-0x600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2646425\" data-ratio=\"0.56285178236398\" data-width=\"1066\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1066px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/2646425-0x600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2646425\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/17537/2646425-0x600.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/17537/2646425-0x600.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Co-op missions are some of the most entertaining parts of the game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At least those theater missions are reasonably fun, which is more than I can say for the bulk of the remaining alternate quests. There are an insane number of side-missions to embark upon, ranging from Nostradamus-themed riddles to typical assassination contracts, with even the occasional murder mystery thrown in for good measure. Every Assassin's Creed game has had its bland side missions, but Unity's are shockingly uniform in their dullness. The murder mysteries, for instance, sound like a cool idea. The local constabulary is too lazy to bother investigating various killings around the city, and Arno volunteers to do the investigative heavy lifting in exchange for free weapons. Unfortunately, how you solve those mysteries involves just going from location to location, turning on eagle vision, and interacting with each highlighted object you see. Eventually all the clues and testimony are found, and you have to accuse a killer. The game doesn't just tell you who the killer is once you've found everything, but deducing the culprit is still incredibly easy. Even on the mysteries set at a higher difficulty, I never once accused the wrong person of a murder, and even if I had, I'd have just taken a small penalty for doing so. The mystery stories are intriguing on the surface, but they're crucially boring to play through. I found that to be the case with the vast majority of side missions. Even as the game tries to frame those missions with additional narrative, none of it clicks. It's great that there are tons of things to do, but when maybe 25% of those things are actually fun, that doesn't mean much.</p><p style=\"\">Co-op missions fare a bit better, at least. These missions exist almost entirely separate from the main story, and allow two-to-four players to take part in elaborate tasks that often require careful tactics. Maybe it's because I found those kinds of tactics so patently unnecessary in the main game, but co-op play turned out to be a breath of fresh air for me. Not every co-op mission is a great deal of fun, but figuring out the right mixture of distraction, stealth, and brute force to apply to each one became one of my favorite things to do in the game. Surprisingly, these missions also tend to be best at marrying the happenings of the revolution to actual gameplay. Opening preambles do a good job of contextualizing why you're doing what you're doing, and how it all fits into the greater history. That the main single-player game is so terrible at this compared to the sectioned-off cooperative missions is a little bit insane.</p><p style=\"\">These missions even do a much better job of utilizing the city's geography and throngs of citizens than the offline game. Some single-player missions present opportunities to dig through the catacombs beneath the city, to hide yourself among the huge crowds of angry citizens protesting against royal excesses, but most of those opportunities come from side-missions. If you just stick to the main campaign, the city takes on a strangely distant quality. Most of its explorable nooks and crannies exist away from what you're tasked with. You see life taking place all around you, with people begging on the streets, wandering out of taverns, singing and chanting, burning effigies and fighting among themselves, but Arno is rarely involved enough to ever feel like he's truly a part of it. No Assassin's Creed game has ever had a world so lovingly crafted, so thoroughly bustling with human activity, and yet no Assassin's Creed game has ever made me feel so thoroughly removed from the world that's been built around me.</p><p style=\"\">There are a lot of little things that take you out of the experience of Unity--copy-and-paste citizens surrounding you, borked animations, delayed texture loading, and such--but they're dwarfed by the very big problems that pop up more often. On the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>, which was my primary platform for testing, the frame rate is a chugging mess. Less populated environments tend to fare better, but areas with large groups of people cause the game to stutter in jarring ways. Typical animation glitches, like getting stuck while trying to traverse a particular building, or clipping through characters as you walk past them, are joined by much crazier showstoppers. Crash bugs, characters falling through the environment, faces not loading properly (resulting in some <a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/9/93998/2699943-5604905601-huYDJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"2699943-5604905601\">memorably</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McNarnia/status/532630981568901121\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">horrific </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dr_Yay/status/532744073216413697\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">abominations</a>), and Arno suddenly being unable to engage in combat in the middle of a battle are among the many, many tech issues I had while playing through Unity.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2700554-assassins-creed-unity_1f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2700554\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2700554-assassins-creed-unity_1f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2700554\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2700554-assassins-creed-unity_1f.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2700554-assassins-creed-unity_1f.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's no shortage of things to do in Unity, but only a fraction of them are especially engaging.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Outside of performance, Unity also has its share of issues with controls. Scaling buildings has never been easier, mind you, thanks to a separation of climb and descent buttons that allow you to safely hop and drop as needed. More often, the issue comes when trying to navigate Arno over smaller pieces of the scenery, or into any window. Arno has a bad habit of getting stuck on things like chimneys, chairs, tables, or anything else that he would perch upon, versus standing normally. Getting him off of those perches can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you're in the middle of an escape. Jumping into windows should be an easy thing, as the game says all you need do is hold down the left trigger while moving toward it. Yet that only works maybe half the time. The rest of the time, you'll jump up, down, and around the window, but not into it. This seems the result of the series' constant streamlining of its parkour mechanics. There's not a lot required of the player to do the insane gymnastics Assassin's Creed heroes are built to do, so the game ends up doing a lot of the heavy lifting by guessing where you're headed next. Unity guesses wrong more often than other AC games that I can recall, which results in the kinds of issues described above.</p><p style=\"\">Those issues can undoubtedly be fixed by a patch somewhere down the road, but that patch seems unlikely to fix Unity's biggest flaw: it's just not very much fun. For all its hugeness and graphical splendor, Unity is starved for excitement. It's much too concerned with a story that feels confused by itself, wasting potentially interesting allies and antagonists in much the same way that it wastes the rich, violent history of its time period. The most interesting missions in the game come far too late, representing glimpses of a better game than the one you just spent hours playing. Even as a tech demonstration, Unity fails to captivate outside of its stunning art design.

This is a game that hits all of the notes that are, by now, quite familiar to fans of BioWare games. By the time you get through the many dozens of hours that it’ll take you to complete the main story, you’ll have fought off forces wishing to effectively end the world, explored lush and varied landscapes, crafted and modified a wide variety of weapons and equipment, built up a stronghold that acts as a resting place between quests, made tough choices between mutually exclusive storyline branches, and recruited party members to fight alongside, talk to, and jump in the sack with. There aren’t any truly surprising facets to the experience if you’ve played any of BioWare’s previous RPGs (and if you haven't, it makes for a great jumping-on point), but if that’s the worst criticism you can level at a game as well-made and enjoyable as this one, then it’s clear its developers have done something right.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87610/2702045-screenshotwin32_0005_final.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702045\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87610/2702045-screenshotwin32_0005_final.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702045\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/87610/2702045-screenshotwin32_0005_final.png\"></a><figcaption>Combat can get messy, but your companions usually hold their own.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Inquisition also feels like a direct response to the many, many criticisms that were thrown at <a href=\"/dragon-age-ii/3030-30995/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30995\">Dragon Age 2</a>. Whereas that game’s story focused on what felt like petty political bickering between the templar and mage factions, Inquisition revs up a high fantasy plot of dragonslaying and dealing with immortal mages wishing to rule over all creation. Dragon Age 2 removed the option for the player to play as an elf or a dwarf; Inquisition restores those choices and throws in the qunari race to boot. The previous game’s action was largely restricted to the smallish city of <a href=\"/kirkwall/3035-3232/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3232\">Kirkwall</a>; Inquisition feels like it contains many times as much land area to explore. It’s perfectly natural to be skittish about returning to the Dragon Age franchise after the uneven mess that was Dragon Age 2, but give BioWare credit for learning from their mistakes and earnestly trying to fix them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">That effort takes a little time to become apparent, though, as Inquisition begins with events that are queasily reminiscent of the end of<em> Dragon Age 2</em>: another massive explosion destroys a building with very important people (including what amounts to the Pope of the world’s major religion) inside of it, which in turn causes the mages and templars of Thedas to enter into open warfare. Your character is the sole survivor of said explosion, and is soon swept up in the creation of an Inquisition whose stated aim is to discover the perpetrator of the attack and their motives. After settling the mage/templar beef, which can blissfully be done within a few hours of starting the game, you find yourself getting your hands dirty in the field, while also attempting to further the aims of the Inquisition’s diplomatic, intelligence, and military arms in a land with enough squabbling factions to make the U.S. Congress seem downright placid in comparison.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The bulk of the game is, of course, spent in combat, where you’ll bring some mixture of warriors, rogues, and mages to bear on the many enemies standing in your way. You control one character a time (with easy and instantaneous switching between party members with a single button press), while the rest of your party is governed by AI. You’re also able to pause and use a tactical view of a fight for more direct control over each member of your party. This can be useful for focus-firing on tough opponents in a chaotic battlefield, but on the default settings (normal difficulty with friendly fire turned off), it rarely felt necessary to pause combat and issue commands directly. Fights look good and feel fun, especially when your party takes on one huge, tough enemy, but can feel scattered and disorganized when a dozen combatants are squaring off in various melees around the map.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87610/2702047-screenshotwin32_0022_final.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702047\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87610/2702047-screenshotwin32_0022_final.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702047\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/8/87610/2702047-screenshotwin32_0022_final.png\"></a><figcaption>It's called Dragon Age for a reason.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">For a game relying so heavily on AI-controlled companions, it’s disappointing that you have such a limited set of ways to modify the behavior of your party members when you’re not controlling them directly. You can disable combat skills for your companions to prevent them from being used, or set those skills to a preferred status to make your friends use them more often, and you can control when they use healing potions and how many resources they keep in reserve, but that’s about it. Both of the previous games in the series allowed for conditional tactics, such that when, for example, a character or enemy fell below a certain health threshold, the AI would trigger the character to cast a certain spell in response. The absence of such a system here feels like a step back for the franchise, and while the AI is acceptable enough on the normal difficulty, it’s likely that players looking for more of a challenge will wind up spending a lot of time micromanaging and babysitting their companions.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">That theme of “competent but not excellent” extends to the actual personalities of your companions. Their individual quests are often entertaining, but beyond that they feel like a rather withdrawn group of fantasy archetypes rather than real people, without a truly memorable Wrex or Minsc or HK-47 to provide moments that you’ll fondly recall well after you finish the game, although the immature rogue Sera comes close. As if in tacit acknowledgement of this, a notable character from the first two games pops up midway through the adventure, but even their appearance is muted by your inability to actually add them to your adventuring party.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87610/2702058-screenshotwin32_0011_final.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702058\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87610/2702058-screenshotwin32_0011_final.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702058\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/87610/2702058-screenshotwin32_0011_final.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/87610/2702058-screenshotwin32_0011_final.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Don't forget to keep your companions...motivated.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There’s a ton of stuff to do here beyond simply charging through the main storyline, and even that feels like an understatement. I spent more time on Inquisition's optional side content alone than I have in almost any other whole game this year. More than a few of the game’s dozen or so large zones might be left entirely unvisited by the time you complete the game, unless you make it a point to venture out and explore them. The quality of that side content is somewhat variable, however. For every well-written quest that one of your party members sends you on, complete with cutscenes and real choices to make, there are half a dozen rote missions of the “go to location X and perform action Y to receive reward Z” school that feel much less satisfying. They serve largely as excuses to explore the massive world and get into a bunch of fights, but it's difficult to carp too much about that, considering that those actions are both quite enjoyable even after spending 50 or more hours in the game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The massive amount of optional content might also contribute to making combat seem a bit more trifling than feels appropriate, though. If you decide to take a break from saving the world in favor of wandering out and taking on side quests, it’s fairly easy to earn enough experience to make your party overwhelmingly powerful by the time you head back to chase down the primary villain. I spent most of my first 20 hours or so simply running around helping villagers and looting hillside caves, and by the time I crept back into the main plot, I had so outleveled the content that I rarely even took any damage to my sword-and-shield fighter in many of the fights that I faced. Some massaging of difficulty levels might be required to retain a sense of challenge as you bounce between main and side quests.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Inquisition also features a combat-heavy, story-free multiplayer mode that sees four players teaming up to clear out dungeons to earn experience and gold, which in turn leads to better gear and more abilities. It’s a stripped-down version of the single-player combat system (with your progress in multiplayer being entirely divorced from your achievements in the main adventure), and it isn't particularly compelling, but it may serve as a diversion for diehards after exhausting the singleplayer content. Microtransactions are included if you really want to spend real money on virtual gold, but doing so doesn't feel necessary to advance.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87610/2702053-screenshotwin32_0001_final.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702053\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87610/2702053-screenshotwin32_0001_final.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702053\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/87610/2702053-screenshotwin32_0001_final.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/87610/2702053-screenshotwin32_0001_final.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's a good chance this will end poorly. </figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">That multiplayer mode seems symptomatic of Inquisition’s primary weakness, though. There’s a bit of a kitchen sink mentality at play here: was anyone really clamoring for a repetitive dungeon-crawling multiplayer mode in a Dragon Age game? Or a couple dozen different mounts, none of which seem to let you travel all that much more quickly than simply wandering around on foot, while removing your ability to loot objects you come across? Or multiple zones and corresponding questlines that have no true bearing on the game’s main plot? It feels like poor form to criticize a game with as much content as Inquisition throws at you, but it does seem like far more attention was paid to peripheral matters than was expended on the central storyline, to the detriment of the latter. Bioware's best games manage to incorporate optional content without detracting from the serious business that must be resolved to save the world, but the balance in Inquisition is shifted a bit too far in favor of the mundane over the epic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">I played Inquisition on three different PCs, and it ran well, looked great, and was almost entirely bug-free on all of them. (The framerate in cutscenes dropped noticeably on each of them, though.) The PC version of the game features a custom UI that allows for quicker access to your character’s skills, and also throws in features like quick saving and an autorun button, but there are still a few niggling issues that popped up, such as the lack of a text chat option in multiplayer and the inability to bind commands to mouse buttons. After giving the mouse/keyboard configuration a whirl early on, I wound up using a controller for the rest of my playthrough.</p><p style=\"\">Dragon Age: Inquisition contains a whole lot of legitimately fun content and pairs it with a like amount of superfluous busywork, but even the optional quests wind up being enjoyable thanks to the quality of the presentation and its satisfying combat mechanics. It’s a welcome return to form for a franchise that felt adrift after Dragon Age 2, and is easily recommendable to RPG fans who have a spare few weeks to dedicate to a single game.</p>", "deck": "Whether you wish to take on world-destroying madmen or simply wander around collecting herbs, Dragon Age: Inquisition is guaranteed to include something you'll enjoy doing.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-687/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35398/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-age-inquisition/3030-35398/", "id": 35398, "name": "Dragon Age: Inquisition"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-11-18 14:02:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-134295/", "id": 134295, "name": "Dragon Age: Inquisition"}, "reviewer": "Matt"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/far-cry-4-review/1900-688/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2702062-2732981-hdpvr2_20141112_183703.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702062\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2702062-2732981-hdpvr2_20141112_183703.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702062\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2702062-2732981-hdpvr2_20141112_183703.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Here's one of the people you can back as leader of the Golden Path.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/far-cry-4/3030-46310/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46310\">Far Cry 4</a> is one of those open-world games where consequences are few, side tasks are many, and you can mostly just blaze your way through the environment, one headshot at a time. Though the story and some of the various activities can certainly be grim in tone, the game is mostly an easy-going trek through the wilderness. You'll meet a fresh cast of weirdos along the way, kill some of them, and come out the other end with... well, probably with even more side activities left to complete, if you feel like it. The developers have made a few changes around the edges, but it's all very similar to <a href=\"/far-cry-3/3030-32933/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32933\">Far Cry 3</a>. If you liked that game and want more of it... this is more of it.</p><p style=\"\">I, as it turns out, really enjoyed Far Cry 3. It sanded off the rough edges of its predecessors and might as well have been some kind of freeform stealth amusement park full of angry guards and douchebag protagonists. For me, the key piece of gameplay in a <a href=\"/far-cry/3025-186/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-186\">Far Cry</a> game has always been the outpost takeover. Specifically, the moments before you strike, when you slowly circle the camp, looking for high ground so you can tag enemies and easily track their movements. From there, I either sneak into the camp to disable some alarms and cut some throats, or just sit back with a sniper rifle and take silenced shots while everyone below panics. It's stealth with no stakes--you get a relatively meaningless experience point boost if you can get everyone before they set off an alarm, but if you're spotted, it's just as easy to \"go loud\" and mow down everyone in your path. Or maybe you're the type to just rush in, guns blazing, right out of the gate. The options are yours. Far Cry 4 has more of these outposts. In fact, it has a level editor that lets you make your own outposts or download them from a server and just take them over, again and again. It's a good time.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, there's more to Far Cry 4 than simply taking over outposts. The story opens with you, as Ajay Ghale, heading to your mother's homeland to deliver her ashes in accordance with her dying wish. What you discover is a war-torn Himalayan nation called Kyrat, ostensibly run by the charismatic and oppressive King <a href=\"/pagan-min/3005-29679/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29679\">Pagan Min</a> but a group of rebels known as the Golden Path hopes to say otherwise. You are inserted into this mix as the son of a freedom fighter, immediately made the face of the rebellion and, despite sounding like you grew up soft in America, you're quite handy with an <a href=\"/ak-47/3055-187/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-187\">AK-47</a>. And zip lines. And flying bike-sized helicopters. And hang gliding. And taking out bases full of trained soldiers without them ever seeing you. And using grappling hooks to swing and rappel around some cliffs. And digging bullets out of your left arm to heal. If you're the sort of person who gets hung up on a player character seemingly knowing everything bout the art of war despite having no visible background that would make that likely, you will find plenty to get hung up on in Far Cry 4. At some point you get the impression that the last thing this game's developers want you to do is actually think about what's happening. Because most of it is pretty ridiculous once you do.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2702064-2732985-hdpvr2_20141111_123841.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702064\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2702064-2732985-hdpvr2_20141111_123841.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702064\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2702064-2732985-hdpvr2_20141111_123841.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There isn't a ton of snow in Far Cry 4, but there's enough to keep things looking fresh.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's a set of campaign missions, and you're mostly free to blaze through those in order, if you like. You'll see some decision points in the story that come from the two co-leaders of the Golden Path. At various points you'll have to back one of them over the other, altering the missions you're going on (you'll decide whether you want to burn down poppy fields to stop Min's heroin production or capture them for the Golden Path's benefit, for example), but the differences are actually pretty minimal, and the decisions you make along the way simply build up to a very clear \"OK, THIS TIME THE PERSON YOU BACK WILL BECOME THE LEADER FOR THE REST OF THE STORY\" roadblock, anyway. Of course, you'll have an easier time with some of that campaign stuff if you perform some side tasks.</p><p style=\"\">What sort of side tasks? Well, taking over the aforementioned outposts gives you more fast travel points around the island. Climbing bell towers to turn off Min's state-run radio broadcasts reveals more of the map. Hunting animals gets you skins that you'll use to craft bigger wallets, ammo bags, holsters that let you carry up to four weapons, and so on. You'll also earn experience points along the way, which turn into ability points, which you spend on things like the ability to reload while running, reduced damage from fire, the ability to takedown heavy enemies with stealth kills, the ability to ride elephants, and so on. In short, it's the same sort of thing you saw in Far Cry 3 with the same sorts of hooks for upgrades and abilities. It took me around 15 hours to get through it, and I left behind plenty of fun side stuff along the way.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2702065-2732988-hdpvr2_20141111_191893.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702065\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2702065-2732988-hdpvr2_20141111_191893.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2702065\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2702065-2732988-hdpvr2_20141111_191893.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2702065-2732988-hdpvr2_20141111_191893.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Autodrive lets you get to a waypoint and focus on the shooting instead of the driving. Cool idea.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's a five-on-five multiplayer side to Far Cry 4 that feels precisely like the sort of thing that shouldn't be in Far Cry 4. Limiting the scope of the world and boring it down to some simple point control and other objective-type matches isn't why you're here. If you want that kind of shooter, go play <a href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty</a>. The co-op, however, is a different story. You can bring your character-based progress into someone else's world and take over outposts together. It's a little clunky and undercooked in spots, but it's fun enough to be worth a shot, especially if you have friends who like to communicate. Taking over fortresses and outposts from opposing sides of the camp is quite cool, even if it does make an easy game even easier. Maybe play on hard if you're looking to really dig into the co-op.</p><p style=\"\">All of this is wrapped in the same sort of nice-looking visuals that you saw in the previous game. It's a well-rendered world with a good draw distance and foliage that is as fun to hide in as it is to burn. It runs well on both PS4 and Xbox One. It also runs great on PC, where the higher potential resolution and better image quality really stands out.

But the little additions and co-op play do make meaningful differences, and on its own terms, Far Cry 4 is a great time.</p>", "deck": "Far Cry 4's open-world provides ludicrous moments and enough chaotic fun to make it worth your while.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-688/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-46310/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/far-cry-4/3030-46310/", "id": 46310, "name": "Far Cry 4"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-11-18 15:17:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-135263/", "id": 135263, "name": "Far Cry 4"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wwe-2k15-review/1900-689/", "description": "<p style=\"\">The best thing I can say about <a href=\"/wwe-2k15/3030-45333/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-45333\">WWE 2K15</a> is that it resembles the current state of the WWE’s television product.

Which is to say nothing of the various aspects of this franchise that have simply gone missing since last year, a number of which will be sorely missed by longtime fans.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2672701-3c6722a73dbb5488abad9297ddaeea89_crop_exact.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2672701\" style=\"width: 650px\" data-ratio=\"0.66461538461538\" data-width=\"650\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2672701-3c6722a73dbb5488abad9297ddaeea89_crop_exact.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2672701\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2672701-3c6722a73dbb5488abad9297ddaeea89_crop_exact.jpg\"></a><figcaption>WWE 2K15 finally gives this series the significant graphical overhaul it's needed for ages.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">None of this should come as any great surprise to anyone who’s been paying attention to <a href=\"/2k-sports/3010-1860/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1860\">2K</a>’s PR message throughout the last year. This was always intended to be the year that features were sacrificed in favor of visuals as the franchise moved onto new platforms. The problem is that the trade-off isn't equitable. The graphical bump that WWE 2K15 gets is certainly impressive, especially when it comes to wrestler models. Most every current WWE superstar has gone through 2K’s face-scanning process, and especially in the case of top tier stars like <a href=\"/john-cena/3005-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-470\">John Cena</a>, <a href=\"/randy-orton/3005-602/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-602\">Randy Orton</a>, and <a href=\"/triple-h/3005-469/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-469\">Triple H</a>, the attention to detail is a massive improvement over what this series has previously been capable of. Some wrestlers in the game evidently weren't face-scanned—the recently departed <a href=\"/cm-punk/3005-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-614\">CM Punk</a>, and the recently <em>departed</em> <a href=\"/the-ultimate-warrior/3005-3591/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3591\">Ultimate Warrior</a> among them—and the quality difference between those characters and those who did get scanned is definitely noticeable. And when the model quality is at its worst in WWE 2K15, it can get <a href=\"http://gfycat.com/SmugGenuineChick\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">pretty nightmarish</a>.</p><p style=\"\">These upgraded wrestlers look their best when strolling down to the ring in their carefully choreographed entrances, and when taunting and strutting around the ring. It’s when those wrestlers come into contact with one another that things start to fall apart. For all 2K’s talk about upgraded animations in this year’s game, the end result isn't quite as impressive as you might hope. Newly motion-captured moves do look good, but they also serve to make older, poorer animations stand out all the more. 2K has also made a significant effort to slow down this year’s game, yet you still see animations that feel like they’re running at twice the speed they should. At times, 2K15 takes on the quality of video footage being sped-up and slowed down during editing. You’ll see wrestlers lumber around, staggering from punches and slams while trying to regain stamina, then suddenly blast into some hyperactive special move that feels like it’s running entirely too fast. It gives the in-game action this awkward quality that never feels quite right.</p><p style=\"\">That’s a shame, because I generally liked some of 2K15’s strides toward a more realistically-paced version of WWE wrestling. Wrestlers now come with stamina meters and multi-tiered health bars that turn your grappler from a sprinting bad-ass into a gasping mess as matches wear on. These systems aren't perfectly balanced—wrestlers tend to tire out a bit too quickly for comfort, and I ran into a few instances where tired wrestlers just refused to get off of one knee for way longer than necessary—but they go a long way toward negating some of the more easily exploited issues of this series’ gameplay.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Less enjoyable is the addition of chain wrestling. Designed to resemble the sorts of back-and-forth early match battles you always see in live wrestling (but never in games), the chain wrestling mechanic turns the early portions of matches into a battle of rock-paper-scissors and right analog stick noodling. When two wrestlers lock up, a prompt appears asking you to choose from one of three different move types, each of which trumps, and is trumped by another. Once you've transitioned to an arm bar, waist lock, or headlock, you then have to find the “sweet spot” to transition to the next stage. You do this my moving the right stick around until the controller begins to rumble, and a circle on the screen fills up red. You keep doing this until one of you has successfully gone through a full procession of chained moves. It’s an interesting idea that does allow for a fair amount of back-and-forth between you and your opponents in a match's early goings, but it’s also not fun for very long. Once the novelty of a new mechanic wore off, I found myself more irritated with having to keep jumping back into this mini-game multiple times during a match. When I wandered into gimmick or multi-wrestler matches that had the chain wrestling turned off, I didn't exactly miss it. You can, thankfully, turn off chain wrestling if you like (at least in exhibition matches, as I couldn't find a way to do so in the game's career modes), but be aware that doing so essentially removes the one big new thing in this year’s gameplay.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2687332-wwe2k15_career4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687332\" style=\"width: 3840px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2687332-wwe2k15_career4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687332\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2687332-wwe2k15_career4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The pace of gameplay has slowed quite a bit in WWE 2K15, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What is bad is how sluggish the controls can feel at times.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Most of whatever else is different compared with <a href=\"/wwe-2k14/3030-41681/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41681\">WWE 2K14</a> isn’t for the better. Reversal timing seems comparatively off by default. The window for reversals can, thankfully, be tweaked in the in-match settings menu, though that doesn’t translate into things like online ranked matches. Apart from animations looking strange at times, gameplay just doesn’t have a great flow to it. Grapples frequently feel sluggish, especially if you’re trying to perform a strong grapple or a ground grapple. I had a variety of instances where my wrestler would just hover over a downed opponent for a few seconds instead of doing the move I was telling the game to perform. This happens a lot. The game often seems to be a little bit behind your commands, not out of some rebalancing of momentum, but simply because it can’t keep up with what the player wants. Glitches and bugs are maybe a bit less prevalent than in previous years, but I still saw my share. You’ll encounter opponents falling over or flying out of the ring despite no move being performed against them, your wrestler awkwardly turning away from their opponent despite the fact that you’re walking toward them, and plenty of physics wonkiness when foreign objects are introduced to the fray. None of these are game-breaking issues, though the crash bugs that popped up now and again certainly were.</p><p style=\"\">Where WWE 2K15 really suffers is in its feature set. Let’s just get the stuff that’s missing out of the way right now. A variety of match types are missing--mostly gimmick types like guest referee and inferno matches--and some of the more popular gimmick bouts can no longer be played with four players. Cuts are most sorely felt in the creation suite, which is as threadbare as any WWE game I can remember from the last decade. Create-a-belt, create-a-finisher, create-an-arena, and story creator modes are straight-up gone this year. Those first three are just kind of a bummer, but that last one is a real dagger for anyone who loved the admittedly stupid, yet kind of wonderful stories that editor let you build. That story editor is what allowed something like <a href=\"http://vgcw.wikia.com/wiki/Video_Game_Championship_Wrestling_Wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">VGCW</a> to worm its way into wrestling fans’ hearts over the last couple of years, it’s why the phrase “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByO5l00uxKY\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">ghost problems</a>” has become part of this very website’s lengthy lexicon of inside jokes. It was a beautifully busted thing that didn't necessarily need upgrading to justify its continued existence. Yet it is absent entirely in 2K15, and that absence is absolutely felt.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The good news is that you can still create wrestlers, entrances, and move-sets, but only that move-set editor feels as complete as last year’s game. Wrestler edit options have been scaled way, way back, not to the point where it’s impossible to make interesting-looking wrestlers, but still a far cry from what you could do in the past. For one particularly egregious example, you can’t create female wrestlers at all. The game tries to make up for some of what's missing by allowing players to upload custom logos via a website, which you can also use to upload your own faces and tattoo designs, should you feel so inclined. This is a really excellent addition that, nonetheless, doesn't quite make up for how gutted the rest of the create-a-wrestler mode feels.</p><p style=\"\">The mode also loads poorly, primarily when you’re editing aspects of a wrestler’s face. You also can’t put clothing items on a wrestler to see how they look; all you get is a preview image that gives no indication how an item will look on your character, and when you do put it on, you get another load time. It makes trying to cycle through options far more of a chore than it ought to be. Entrances have been reduced to almost exclusively offering entrances for existing wrestlers, and only a handful of those can be edited using the “advanced” editor. Custom music options also seem to have been removed, and you can’t even use the songs from John Cena’s much-promoted “curated soundtrack” as wrestler entrances. Not that I would have wanted to, since that soundtrack is one of the worst collections of licensed music I've ever heard in a video game, but still.</p><p style=\"\">You can, at the very least, now edit existing wrestlers from the WWE roster in order to keep outfits up-to-date, if that's your thing. That said, doing so requires you to insert that edited wrestler into one of the game's create-a-wrestler slots, of which there are only 25 this year, versus the 100 available last year.</p><p style=\"\">There’s also no big, grandiose story mode feature this year, or at least no version that scratches the same nostalgic itch that the 30 Years of Wrestlemania and Attitude Era modes did. 2K15’s version, 2K Showcase, is a more limited examination of specific rivalries throughout the WWE’s history. The game launches with two rivalries: John Cena and CM Punk’s back-and-forth around the WWE Championship from 2011, and Triple H and <a href=\"/shawn-michaels/3005-597/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-597\">Shawn Michaels</a>' post-DX blood feud from the early 2000s. Both modes feature a collection of matches that took place during those feuds, each of which comes with in-game objectives that allow you to relive some of the key moments from those contests. Some of those objectives prove a great deal more challenging than one might prefer, especially any time you’re tasked with wrangling a particular scenario out of a multi-wrestler match. Having to survive through four other competitors as Triple H during an elimination chamber match, just so you can switch over to Shawn Michaels at the end, is more arduous than fun, and only a handful of these matches are all that memorable to begin with. I did like being able to play through the Cena/Punk title match that saw Punk absconding with the title, but only a few of the matches that came afterward managed to hold my attention. 2K is apparently going to flesh this mode out a bit more via DLC, including some segments featuring highlight matches from the careers of the Ultimate Warrior and <a href=\"/mark-henry/3005-575/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-575\">Mark Henry</a>, but as-is, Showcase feels depressingly light on interesting content.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2687329-wwe2k15_career1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687329\" style=\"width: 3840px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2687329-wwe2k15_career1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2687329\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2687329-wwe2k15_career1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/39/2687329-wwe2k15_career1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>MyCareer attempts to create something similar to NBA 2K's MyPlayer mode for created wrestlers, but mostly it's just a slog to play through.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Shockingly, the best part of 2K Showcase is the commentary from <a href=\"/michael-cole/3040-99997/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99997\">Michael Cole</a> and <a href=\"/jerry-lawler/3040-59816/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-59816\">Jerry Lawler</a>. I know, I know, the words “good commentary” and “Cole/Lawler” don’t belong together under nearly any circumstances. In this case, 2K had the pair record a ton of situation-specific commentary for the Showcase matches, and this stuff is light years more interesting to listen to than anything else they do in the game. There is additional new commentary that mixes in with the old stuff in other modes, but very little of it involves more than just one of the two rattling off moves that wrestlers know how to do and championships they’ve won. Some of it is even bizarrely out of date; Jerry Lawler talking at length about Daniel Bryan using the Cattle Mutilation submission hold, despite him not having used that move on WWE television in ages, for instance. But the Showcase commentary is littered with information both relevant to the matches at hand, and acknowledgments of the outer-depths of WWE lore—Damien Demento and Max Moon references, anyone? None of it is perfect, but it’s the closest these guys have come in ages to sounding like men who enjoy, and know a good bit about wrestling, as though these recording sessions were an opportunity for them to send the audience a cry for help through a venue that <a href=\"/vince-mcmahon/3005-471/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-471\">Vince McMahon</a> has no chance of ever stumbling upon. We hear you, guys.</p><p style=\"\">Elsewhere, the WWE Universe returns in a somewhat expanded (but mostly familiar) form, though I expect a lot of players will ignore it initially in favor of the new MyCareer mode. This mode intends to give WWE fans something in the same vein as the MyPlayer mode in the <a href=\"/nba-2k/3025-498/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-498\">NBA 2K</a> series. On paper, it sounds terrific. You take a created superstar from a try-out in NXT into a full-fledged career in the WWE, with rivalries and storylines appearing along the way. The reality of this mode as executed in WWE 2K15 is, sadly, something entirely different. You do start out in NXT, with trainer Bill DeMott barking orders at you as you work your way onto TV, fighting for the NXT championship. But then something peculiar happened. Within the span of a few matches, I managed to get a title shot, and then won it. Suddenly I was NXT champion, and forced to defend my title on a weekly basis. Which is fine, except that once I’d done that, I was very suddenly promoted to WWE Superstars, and soon after had to relinquish my title. By the time I was on to the WWE main roster, I’d had what amounted to a cup of coffee in NXT. Maybe it’s because there’s only a small number of NXT wrestlers available in 2K15, but the game seemed to be in a tremendous hurry to usher me out of there and get me onto the main roster. Speaking as someone who often enjoys NXT more than most of the main roster shows, this was a big disappointment.</p><p style=\"\">That disappointment might have been salved if what came next were markedly better, but that isn’t the case. From here on out, you have to work your way from Superstars to Main Event, to SmackDown!, and eventually to RAW. Disregarding the fact that roster splits haven’t existed in the WWE in several years, this structure also proves a remarkably boring way to progress your wrestler’s career. Much of your time is spent working dark matches and tune-up matches, matches that have no bearing on any storylines, but do provide boosts to the amount of in-game currency or social media fans you earn, respectively. The problem is that after a few hours, those bonuses become far less meaningful. By the time I was halfway through my SmackDown! tenure, I'd already purchased most of the skill upgrades I could ever want. The same goes for the mode's experience point system, which comes from working more exciting matches. Ignoring that the game's definition of an \"exciting match\" is woefully inconsistent, I still managed to boost my wrestler up to maximum stats for his weight class by around that same point in my career. Yet I was still being fed these dull, now utterly pointless matches on a regular basis, with even less reason to care.</p><p style=\"\">It just goes on like this until you eventually win the WWE championship at Wrestlemania, at which point the credits abruptly roll, and your career skips all the way ahead to your own retirement match at a future Wrestlemania (which, of course, takes place in the Wrestlemania XXX arena). No title defenses past that initial win, just THE END followed by a few final exhibition matches. Not exactly a banner career, considering I barely had any feuds to speak of during it. The only significant rivalry I had involved The Shield showing up to extract a bit of justice on who they believed to be an unworthy new competitor, and that rivalry lasted for all of a few matches. Then things just fell back into the same holding pattern of pointless match after pointless match. Occasional cutscenes would appear, but mostly I'd just see the same menu pop-ups over and over again. There's depressingly little in the way of player choice, and the choices you are presented with don't add much flavor to the proceedings. What few nuggets of excitement the mode offers are largely drowned out by tedium.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2672700-1e7f253864ab1af762e51f52b3d48771_crop_north.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2672700\" style=\"width: 630px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"630\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2672700-1e7f253864ab1af762e51f52b3d48771_crop_north.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2672700\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2672700-1e7f253864ab1af762e51f52b3d48771_crop_north.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2672700-1e7f253864ab1af762e51f52b3d48771_crop_north.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Unless you're absolutely dying for a more attractive wrestling game than last year's, you're probably better off sticking with 2K14.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">And then there's online play, which has seen some of the most confusing changes anywhere in the game. WWE games of late have come with their share of online problems, but I'm not certain that matchmaking menus were really the villain most people were focused on. Thus, 2K15's switch to a \"background matchmaking\" system, which has players essentially opt-in for challenges from online competitors while sitting in non-online game menus, is an odd choice. Private matches still use the same basic matchmaking screen you're likely accustomed to, but ranked matches can only be played using this system. On its own, that change is merely confusing, but the fact that ranked matches require you to set long-term match type and favorite wrestler preferences, rather than just letting you choose those options on the fly in each match, is a little bit insane. Meanwhile, online performance is still fairly suspect. I only experienced a few instances of connection drops while trying to connect with other players (though those drops often came along with a full-on game crash), but lag was a prevalent issue through most of the matches I played. Not the kind of lag that dragged the whole match down, but the kind that made reversals and pin kickouts considerably more difficult than in the offline game.</p><p style=\"\">With all these issues considered, it's hard to look at WWE 2K15 as anything but a massive downgrade. Yes, 2K has imbued 2K15 with impressive graphical prowess, but those hot visuals don't mean a whole hell of a lot when the rest of the game feels so undercooked. At best, 2K15 shows some glimmers of hope for the future, laying the groundwork for modes and features that could be turned into something great in upcoming iterations. But as those features exist within the confines of WWE 2K15, little of what's here is strong enough to make up for what's been lost in transition.</p>", "deck": "The move to more powerful consoles has resulted in a prettier looking wrestling game, but also a far less enjoyable one.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-689/", "platforms": "Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-45333/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wwe-2k15/3030-45333/", "id": 45333, "name": "WWE 2K15"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2014-11-20 08:30:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-137831/", "id": 137831, "name": "WWE 2K15"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-for-wii-u-review/1900-690/", "description": "<p style=\"\">It’s been six years since Nintendo’s all-stars last graced our television screens in a Super Smash Bros. release, but the freshness of this Wii U release may be slightly lessened thanks to the recent release of the franchise's <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-for-nintendo-3ds-review/1900-660/\" data-ref-id=\"1900-660\">portable debut</a> a couple months back.

My favorite option by far is the classic <a href=\"/gamecube-controller/3000-47/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-47\">GameCube controller</a>, and you can connect up to eight of them via the use of two adapters.

Replacing the 3DS version’s Smash Run is the new Smash Tour mode that functions like a board game. Fans of Giant Bomb are well aware of my tolerance for <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/mario-party-party/2300-9281/\" data-ref-id=\"2300-9281\">dumb Nintendo-themed</a> <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/mario-party-party-2/2300-9680/\" data-ref-id=\"2300-9680\">board games</a>, but even I didn’t find myself having any fun with this half-hearted mode. It tasks you with moving around a board with dice rolls, collecting stat boosts and characters on the board as you go. It all leads up to a final confrontation in which you utilize those characters and boosts in a traditional Smash Bros. battle to determine the ultimate victor. The board-based buildup isn’t worth it, and you’re better off just sticking to one of the more traditional modes.</p><p style=\"\">Like the 3DS version, there isn’t a substantial single-player story mode to be found here. However, I did find the Events grid to be a fun replacement. Instead of telling one long, cutscene-heavy story like <a href=\"/super-smash-bros-brawl/3030-20588/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20588\">Brawl’s</a> <a href=\"/subspace-emissary/3015-836/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-836\">Subspace Emissary</a>, the Events mode tells several bite-sized stories within the confines of the game itself. Battles are spread out across a grid that expands as you progress, and each fight features intro text that offers some context. One has you playing as <a href=\"/jigglypuff/3005-21143/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21143\">Jigglypuff</a>, tasked with putting several child characters (<a href=\"/bowser-jr/3005-825/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-825\">Bowser, Jr.</a>, <a href=\"/link/3005-191/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a>, Toon Link) to sleep, as it’s past their bedtime. Another has <a href=\"/little-mac/3005-357/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-357\">Little Mac</a> being ravaged by a wireframe boxer, and you have to step in as <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> (the referee from the original <a href=\"/mike-tysons-punch-out/3030-4848/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4848\">Punch-Out</a>) to break up the fight. These are goofy and not nearly as substantial as something like Subspace Emissary, but I looked forward to seeing what each new scenario involved as I unlocked it.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Master Orders and Crazy Orders are new modes that have you completing tasks set forth by the boss <a href=\"/master-hand/3005-730/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-730\">Hand</a> characters. The former are one-off challenges that reward you with various trophies and customizable special moves. Crazy Orders are a different story, allowing you to take on numerous challenges for rewards before taking on <a href=\"/crazy-hand/3005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3319\">Crazy Hand</a> himself. Beating several challenges will give you increasingly valuable rewards, but you’ll lose them all if you lose to the boss at the end. These modes are nice distractions and a good way to fill out your list of unlockables, but I didn’t feel like returning to them nearly as much as Events mode.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2662465-111620_wupp_ax_scrncn11_12_ev07b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2662465\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2662465-111620_wupp_ax_scrncn11_12_ev07b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2662465\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/82063/2662465-111620_wupp_ax_scrncn11_12_ev07b.jpg\"></a><figcaption>I hope you like Fire Emblem, because there is a LOT of it in this game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The single-player offerings have their ups and downs, but Smash Bros. for Wii U shines where the series has always shined: multiplayer. This console release is a step up from its 3DS little brother in this department, thanks in no small part to the ability to play on the same screen. Nintendo’s characters and stages look fantastic in HD, and playing with friends as you’re all huddled over individual 3DS screens just can’t compare to couch play. Even without the added modes and stages in this Wii U version, the experience is significantly improved by its console nature alone.</p><p style=\"\">I was initially concerned that the eight-player mode would be too chaotic to be enjoyable, but I was happy to be proven wrong during a riotous, hours-long session that was consistently entertaining. Eight-player Smash isn’t playable online, which is probably for the best, considering I encountered a decent amount of lag with four players. This was a problem with Brawl on the Wii, and Nintendo’s spotty (at best) history with online play makes me wonder if this Wii U entry will hit a point where it’s consistently lag-free. Fans that want to play with friends across the country (or world) are bound to be disappointed by this, but I wasn’t particularly irked as couch play is where the best multiplayer experience lies.</p><p style=\"\">There’s a ton of content on this disc, and some of it feels disposable. A full create-a-stage mode could have some potential if players were given ample tools and the ability to share their creations online, but the mode included here is bare-boned and restricted to local saves (for now...share functionality may be coming in the future). As the first Nintendo game to utilize their new Amiibo figures, it doesn’t do a whole lot to sell me on their value. After earning equipment in the game’s single-player modes, you can feed it to your Amiibo AI character to improve its stats. You can team up with it or fight it in Smash mode to level it up and make it even more powerful, but I never quite understood what’s supposed to be fun about this system. We’ll see what these figures do in future titles, but I’m definitely not rushing to the store to pick up the full set anytime soon.</p><p style=\"\">Some modes flop in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, but the important thing is that the core game is expanded upon and significantly improved over entries in the franchise’s past. Its roster and stages are unmatched, and the variety of controller options is fantastic. 8-Player Smash wound up being far more fun than I expected it to be, and is destined to become a game night/party staple for years to come. It’s one of the best reasons to own a Wii U, and it’s easily one of 2014’s premier multiplayer experiences.</p>", "deck": "Nintendo's all-stars assemble once again, resulting in one of the best reasons to own a Wii U (and eight GameCube controllers).", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-690/", "platforms": "Wii U", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35573/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-smash-bros-for-wii-u-nintendo-3ds/3030-35573/", "id": 35573, "name": "Super Smash Bros. for Wii U/Nintendo 3DS"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-11-21 13:40:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-135179/", "id": 135179, "name": "Super Smash Bros. for Wii U"}, "reviewer": "Dan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review/1900-691/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2690611-ivnoeruv4zdwo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2690611\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2690611-ivnoeruv4zdwo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2690611\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/82063/2690611-ivnoeruv4zdwo.png\"></a><figcaption>Some enemies can be defeated with Toad's head lamp.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In the shadow of Nintendo’s big holiday release of <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3030-35573/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35573\">Smash Bros.</a> comes <a href=\"/captain-toad-treasure-tracker/3030-46581/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46581\">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>, an odd experiment that spun off of a set of levels in <a href=\"/super-mario-3d-world/3030-42931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42931\">Super Mario 3D World</a>. These levels served as a change of pace in that fast-paced, co-op platformer, and put players in control of an adventurous <a href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-845\">Toad</a> that can’t jump (on account of his heavy backpack, naturally). Treasure Tracker sees that concept blown out to its own retail release, which maintains all of the charm of the series it comes from, but lacks a bit of its variety and value.</p><p style=\"\">Instead of collecting a variable number of green stars like in 3D World, Treasure Tracker has Captain Toad collecting three crystals in each stage before ultimately reaching the star at the end. It’s almost organized like a mobile game, with a collection of bite-sized levels that can be “beaten” by simply reaching the end or actually beaten once you’ve collected all three crystals. Sure, you can finish a level of <a href=\"/angry-birds/3025-1879/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1879\">Angry Birds</a> by killing all the pigs or move forward in <a href=\"/cut-the-rope/3025-1921/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1921\">Cut the Rope</a> by simply feeding the candy to Om Nom, but fans of those games know the real fun and challenge is in getting all three stars before you move forward. Treasure Tracker is no different, in that I felt like I was failing a stage if I simply reached the star at the end while leaving one or more crystals behind.</p><p style=\"\">In addition to the three crystals, a bonus objective is revealed after you reach the end of each stage. This can be in the form of coins collected, finding a golden <a href=\"/1up-mushroom/3055-6067/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6067\">1-up mushroom</a>, or even introducing simple stealth objectives like sneaking past a bunch of patrolling <a href=\"/shy-guy/3015-3891/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3891\">Shy Guys</a>. Each stage is presented as a page in a book about Captain Toad (and <a href=\"/toadette/3005-1296/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1296\">Toadette</a>), and the page doesn’t receive a stamp until you’ve collected all three crystals and satisfied the bonus objective.</p><p style=\"\">I enjoyed all the stages on my first playthrough, but found myself liking the game significantly more once I had “beaten” the game but still lacked the stamp on many pages. Since the stages are so small, I often found myself rotating the camera and trying to look at every possible angle in an effort to find a pesky crystal that I had previously missed. There were times that I thought “there’s no way there’s another crystal here...I’ve looked everywhere” only to stumble upon a hidden passage or look at the stage with a specific camera angle that revealed the crystal’s location. These moments were my favorites in Treasure Tracker, and I wouldn’t have experienced them if I had just blown through the game and never returned to levels that I hadn’t fully completed.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2690613-itghqkjas08sj.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2690613\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2690613-itghqkjas08sj.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2690613\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/82063/2690613-itghqkjas08sj.png\"></a><figcaption>Specific panels will let you rotate elements of the stage with the GamePad.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Like 3D World, there is very little in the way of gimmicky motion or touch controls. You can tap some enemies to hold them in place, but I rarely found that necessary. A handful of levels have you touching the screen or blowing on the mic to move platforms around, but it’s never done so much as to be aggravating. Other levels shake up the format and feature mine carts with turnip cannons that can be aimed by moving the GamePad. Some abandon the slow-paced nature of the game by having Toad hit speed boosts to sprint past rapidly collapsing roads. Even when you’re working your way through these more unique levels, the “three crystals and a star” format stays intact.</p><p style=\"\">I consistently enjoyed my time with Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, but I frequently questioned the value component of this package. At $40, the offering does feel a bit slim. There are well under 100 small levels, and the two main boss fights are recycled in slightly-changed forms several times. The Captain Toad stages were nice changes of pace in the otherwise action-packed 3D World, but the novelty does wear thin quicker when you’re playing through a constant stream of them (despite the attempts to shake things up from time to time). Treasure Tracker is a charming game, but might disappoint some if they drop $40 expecting something more ambitious or substantial. If you know what you’re getting into and you’re alright with spending the money, there’s plenty of fun to be had on Captain Toad’s adventure.</p>", "deck": "The little mushroom man finally gets his name on the marquee, and the result is a charming, unique, and puzzle-heavy adventure.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-691/", "platforms": "Wii U", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-46581/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/captain-toad-treasure-tracker/3030-46581/", "id": 46581, "name": "Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2014-12-01 07:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-136498/", "id": 136498, "name": "Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker"}, "reviewer": "Dan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/geometry-wars-3-dimensions-review/1900-694/", "description": "<p style=\"\">It must have been difficult to come up with a sequel to one of the most perfect games ever made, but they did it. It was called <a href=\"/geometry-wars-retro-evolved-2/3030-21167/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21167\">Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2</a>. Where that game featured five or six times as much content as its laser-focused dual-joystick predecessor, Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions similarly beefs up the offering over Retro Evolved 2, and yet over six years later sells at the same price. I don't love every new thing about Dimensions--some of it feels like it's missing the point of what made the original so great--but there are a lot of interesting ideas in here, and holy cow is it nice just to play a new <a href=\"/geometry-wars/3025-237/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-237\">Geometry Wars</a> game again.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2705737-geowars3_screens_titanbox_xbox_excl_lvl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2705737\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2705737-geowars3_screens_titanbox_xbox_excl_lvl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2705737\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/30/2705737-geowars3_screens_titanbox_xbox_excl_lvl.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of the new levels make it a real pain to see where enemies are coming from.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Dimensions is entirely built on and expands the concepts in Retro Evolved 2. That means having to pick up geoms from dead enemies to increase your multiplier. It means gimmick modes like pacifism and king are featured prominently. It means more of those damnable orange triangle things that sweep the board back and forth in a straight line. All the modes from 2 (except sequence) are bundled here in the classic menu, each with an attached leaderboard, so when all else is said and done, you've still got a way to compete for more high scores in the same familiar game types on the new consoles.</p><p style=\"\">The centerpiece of this third game, and the biggest departure, is a new 50-stage adventure campaign that features all of 2's existing modes, along with a handful of interesting new ones, spread across a ton of weirdly shaped levels. Yes, the flat plane of the traditional square-shaped Geometry Wars board takes a backseat here to abstract geometric forms like cubes and spheres, along with more recognizable shapes that resemble things like a peanut or a hot dog. (I'm noticing a theme here.)</p><p style=\"\">It's these fully 3D levels that fundamentally change the way you have to play, since you can't count on seeing every enemy threat in your peripheral vision. Rounding a corner and running smack into an enemy you couldn't see a second before happens a little more often than it should. Where the older games were hard but entirely fair, some of the maps here turn out to be the bad kind of frustrating. Those levels are in the minority, but they can get pretty annoying, and while changing up your play style (leading with your guns around edges and so on) helps mitigate the lack of vision, I couldn't help but long for the big old flat rectangle from time to time.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">In addition to a diverse lineup of shapes, every one of the adventure levels has a unique set of rules and conditions that keeps you guessing and changing up tactics in the existing game modes. Some of them have teleporters. Some have moving, lethal walls. Some are populated with virus-like enemies that multiply and fill the entire level if you don't shoot them fast enough. Every iteration of familiar modes like evolved and deadline comes with a twist of some sort, and there are a handful of original modes conceived for adventure. I enjoyed rainbow, where you have to rack up points until a legion of orange scrubbing bubbles paints the entire game board orange. Another mode that starts you with a finite amount of ammo, not so much. At least there's a heck of a lot of variety in there. One of the modes is quite literally <a href=\"/asteroids/3025-40/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-40\">Asteroids</a>, with giant enemies that bust up into smaller ones when you kill them. That's a fitting homage.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2705747-geowars3_screens_opal_boss2_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2705747\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2705747-geowars3_screens_opal_boss2_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2705747\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/0/30/2705747-geowars3_screens_opal_boss2_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's enough variety in the adventure mode to keep you busy for a very long time.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">The adventure mode has a satisfying progression aspect. You can pick from one of five drones and one of five super attacks (which accompanies the traditional smart bomb) when you head into a level. The drones do things like ram enemies, fire targeted sniper shots, or collect geoms for you, while the supers will fire a bunch of homing missiles, create a defensive black hole, and so on. You can level these guys up by cashing in the thousands of geoms you've picked up, and unlock new ones by making it to specific points in the adventure mode. You earn up to three stars for your score on each level, and every 10 levels you need to hit a specific threshold to move on to the next set. The adventure mode is surprisingly tough; more often than not, I'd bump into that star wall and have to head back to previous levels to grind out a few more, since in a lot of cases I was only managing one or two stars my first time through a given level. Getting through the adventure mode at all will take you some time and effort, and maxing out all the upgrades and getting three stars will take a ton more.</p><p style=\"\">While Geometry Wars is at its best as a single-player score attack where you're chasing your friends on a leaderboard, there's both local co-op for four players and an online team-based competitive mode in here for good measure. The co-op is sensibly designed, having each player racking up their own score during a level but then combining them all for stars and a high score at the end of the match. There are only 10 levels in there for co-op players, alas. You also get a couple of four-on-four competitive online modes as well, which have you vying for control of a couple of towers on the map or simply competing to earn score against a set of enemy waves faster than the other team. The online modes are fine for what they are, but multiplayer isn't what I'm coming to this game for, and I had a heck of a time even finding other players to get into matches with in the first place.</p><p style=\"\">Geometry Wars 3 is a really nice package; the animated menu transitions are slick and snappy, you won't see a single load screen once you're in the game, there are leaderboards absolutely everywhere, and the angular neon pop of the series' visual design, loaded with flashy particle effects and deformation of the level surfaces, has never looked better. Purists will undoubtedly find some of the adventure levels more irksome than others, but chasing high scores, drone upgrades, and ever more stars remains satisfying throughout. It's not the perfect Geometry Wars sequel after all this time, but it's still pretty damn fun in its own right.</p>", "deck": "Dimensions recaptures enough of Geometry Wars' thrills to stand as the best new dual-joystick shooter in quite a while.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-694/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-47352/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/geometry-wars-3-dimensions/3030-47352/", "id": 47352, "name": "Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2014-12-02 16:30:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-138658/", "id": 138658, "name": "Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell-review/1900-695/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"/saints-row-iv/3030-36884/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36884\">Saints Row IV</a> took the Third Street Saints to their inevitably insane conclusion.

Since you’re playing as either Gat or Kinzie, you don’t have any wiggle room when it comes to your character’s appearance. This extends beyond your face and physical build, as the myriad clothing stores and options from the past are nowhere to be found in hell. One of my favorite things about previous games (The Third in particular) was the ability to pull out an in-game cell phone and have one of your fellow Saints deliver vehicles to you. This isn’t an option in Gat out of Hell, but it’s not a terrible loss considering there’s no real reason to drive around since it’s so easy to sprout demon wings and fly across the underworld. Other omissions are made, such as the ability to upgrade a home base or switch between radio stations, but I wasn’t particularly surprised considering the smaller scope of the game.</p><p style=\"\">One of the more concerning elements of Gat out of Hell is a variety of technical issues. I played on the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>, and the framerate would frequently drop if I was flying around while there was a lot of activity on the screen. In addition, it’s not uncommon to see awkward animation glitches and collision detection issues. On one occasion, the game suffered from a hard lock and I had to restart the system.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Collecting orbs, leveling up your character, and being surrounded by Saints Row’s brand of wackiness is still a lot of fun, even if Gat out of Hell doesn’t live up to the experience of the full games. On the surface, it seems like it might have a wider variety of activities than it does, as early missions have you hunting down characters like <a href=\"/vlad-the-impaler/3005-19542/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19542\">Vlad the Impaler</a>, <a href=\"/william-shakespeare/3005-19852/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19852\">Shakespeare</a>, and <a href=\"/blackbeard/3005-20205/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20205\">Blackbeard </a>in an effort to make them join your fight. Once you’ve met them, however, their “missions” are simply a collection of diversions that are already found in the open world. These are still fun to do, but I would have liked a little more in the way of traditional story missions.</p><p style=\"\">Gat out of Hell isn’t particularly long, as the core story can be completed in about two hours. I continued playing after the credits rolled and am currently at the seven hour mark with a 92% completion rate, but you probably won’t have much of a reason to put that much time in if you don’t have a high tolerance for flying around and collecting hundreds of orbs.

Its gameplay was simple, requiring players to draw paths on the touchscreen for <a href=\"/kirby/3005-726/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-726\">Kirby</a> to follow. Navigating the levels wasn’t a complex procedure, but it nonetheless felt like a unique experience that was custom-made for the DS (this is before the <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"/ipad/3045-121/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-121\">iPad</a> made touch-controlled games commonplace). I had a great time with the game, and I certainly wasn’t alone. It’s widely regarded as one of the best early titles in the DS library.</p><p style=\"\">Almost a decade later, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse revives the format for the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a>. While the touchscreen gameplay is intact and it features a gorgeous clay-based art style, the experience of actually playing it is a far cry from those early DS days.</p><p style=\"\">One thing you’ll notice right off the bat is that it’s almost impossible to look at the TV screen while you’re playing. There’s no good way to determine where the stylus is located if it’s not actively touching the screen, so your eyes need to be glued to the <a href=\"/off-tv-play/3015-7482/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7482\">GamePad</a> if you want to play this game.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">On the surface, the gameplay seems similar enough to Canvas Curse. You lead Kirby by drawing rainbow-colored paths for him to follow, and you can scoot him along faster by tapping on him directly. If you collect 100 stars, you can hold the stylus on him for a moment to charge a star dash that can break through special blocks and do extra damage to bosses.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Nothing about the gameplay feels broken, it just feels soulless this time around. Levels are linear and don’t offer much in the way of challenge, and it’s rare that it strays from the “guide Kirby to the exit and collect stars” formula. Canvas Curse incorporated Kirby’s power to inherit abilities from dead enemies, but that’s been taken out for this entry. Occasional levels will have Kirby morphing into a rocket, torpedo, or tank, but these stages feel even more stripped-down and simple than the standard levels.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">There are seven worlds (with three levels each) that fit squarely within traditional platformer themes, and each one ends with a boss fight. Many of these are frustrating, and require a level of precise control that your stylus just can’t provide. Even with so few worlds, you’ll see more than one boss recycled for another area with a minor twist (this time he’s underwater!).</p><p style=\"\">Outside of using a rainbow path to shuttle Kirby along to the end of each level, there isn’t much to do. Each stage has a handful of (barely) hidden treasure chests that unlock figurines, and you can also collect little bonuses like music tracks and diary pages. None of these collectibles inspired me to go out of my way to obtain them, but they don’t add much in the way of challenge even if I had gone for 100%. Bare-bones challenge rooms can also be unlocked after beating areas, but they’re nothing more than an assortment of 15-second rooms that task you with getting to a treasure chest in time.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2698920-ldyyyzf+-+imgur.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2698920\" style=\"width: 1365px\" data-ratio=\"0.56263736263736\" data-width=\"1365\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2698920-ldyyyzf+-+imgur.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2698920\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/82063/2698920-ldyyyzf+-+imgur.png\"></a><figcaption>Up to three other players can join in to babysit Kirby.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Other players can hop in and out with a variety of Wii U-compatible controllers, and they appear as <a href=\"/waddle-dee/3015-2069/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2069\">Waddle Dees</a>. It’s actually refreshing to play as them, as they can be directly controlled with a standard controller rather than the unreliable stylus paths. Several frustrating boss fights are made more tolerable if you have a friend jump in as Waddle Dee and spam melee attacks while you simply try to wrangle Kirby’s movements and keep him alive.</p><p style=\"\">Playing Kirby and the Rainbow Curse was a tedious experience from beginning to end, and it lacks the \"time and place\" factor of Canvas Curse.

It's a technical showpiece, a graphical powerhouse that, in some ways, is almost without equal. It's also a short and disappointingly straightforward cover-based shooter that offers little to no variety in its encounter design, a lackluster story that fails to make good on its initially compelling premise, and a set of jarring <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Event</a> setpieces that aren't especially interesting from a gameplay or a storytelling perspective.</p><p style=\"\">From the second the title screen appears, The Order begins signifying that it's trying to be cinematic in its presentation. The game appears in a letterboxed format, one typically reserved for films. When applied to a video game, the forced borders make your view of the action look small. I felt a little claustrophobic in some spots, because it was difficult to get a bead on the action. Are the borders there for artistic reasons? Or are they there to prevent the developers from having to keep an often-terrific-looking game from running at full resolution? In the end, it doesn't matter. The letterboxing got in my way, made the action a little harder to follow (especially when enemies get up close), and lessened the overall experience. Not to soapbox too much about this, but games are capable of more than films. As games become more and more visually impressive, chasing after the silver screen feels like a weaker and weaker goal.</p><p style=\"\">The Order is set in a fantastical, but somewhat grounded alternate take on Britain in 1886. In this timeline, the order of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table still holds sway as men and women who have found ways to extend their lifespans to hundreds of years. Or, at least, that's the implication. In this take, the knights of this order are battling the half-breeds--Lycans, to be specific. That's fancy talk for \"<a href=\"/werewolves/3015-543/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-543\">werewolf</a>,\" in case you didn't know. To battle this threat, they'll use a lot of standard video game weaponry, like an array of pistols, a few rifles, and some more \"science\" weapons, like a lightning-launching arc gun or a piece that fires thermite dust at targets only to ignite said dust with a launched flare, burning your targets where they stand.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1702/2571177-10441170723_8a1a1cbb31_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2571177\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.41640625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:41.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1702/2571177-10441170723_8a1a1cbb31_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2571177\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/1702/2571177-10441170723_8a1a1cbb31_o.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The fancier ends of the arsenal come courtesy of <a href=\"/nikola-tesla/3005-9322/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9322\">Nikola Tesla</a>, who rolls with your order. The fancier ends of the arsenal also don't appear too frequently, either, so you're doing most of your dirty work with very standard-feeling weapons. Like a lot of other shooters, most of the pistols in The Order are quite accurate, making it easy to rack up headshots and take out most standard enemies before they even become a threat. Aside from fighting werewolves, which isn't nearly as interesting as it sounds and involves too many on-screen button prompts, the most dangerous enemy in The Order is an armored man with a shotgun. The shotgunners tend to flank you a bit, take more damage than most soldiers, and fire quickly enough to bring you down while you're still trying to get a shot off. It's nice that there's something there to keep you from getting too comfortable behind cover, but it's easy to adapt to once you know what to look for, and, generally speaking, the combat is a little boring.</p><p style=\"\">You'll transition into and out of action in a completely seamless fashion. There's no difference in visual quality between the cutscenes and the part where you're walking around, occasionally shooting at things. There's no on-screen indicator that you're not playing, either, save for obvious touches like a change in the camera angle. There are no load times between these sequences. As such, you might find yourself standing still for a few seconds and have the dumb realization of \"oh wait, I'm supposed to play the game now!\" The Order also traffics in Quick Time Events, and at this point you've probably already made up your mind on those. They're relatively innocuous here, but they also come up a bit too frequently. Mashing a button to reach for a knife makes sense, and occasionally hitting a random button to keep what would otherwise be a cutscene from ending in your grisly death isn't the worst thing in the world. It just doesn't really add much to the action, either. It doesn't help that the game's two, roughly identical boss encounters are little more than slightly overblown QTEs. Nothing about it is exciting and the best thing I can say about the QTEs is that, should you fail one, the game will very quickly reload to the last checkpoint and let you try it again.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">There are also a couple of stealth sequences in The Order, and these are lamely produced, but there's a timing mechanic to the stealth kills that is, at least, somewhat different than the norm. The stealth sequences are forced--there's no option to shoot it out if you get caught, so it's an instant failure and reload to checkpoint when you're discovered. The story backs up the reasoning for that and all, but the way failure is met with a quick angle of your protagonist getting blasted in the face by a guard makes the whole thing feel like it fell out of some strange world where Laser Disc games are still king. It's not difficult enough to make these stealth sequences a sticking point, but it's one of those things you can't help but look at and wonder why this made it into the final game. It feels about as half-baked as the way the game lets you pick up and examine objects, occasionally forcing you to examine them by moving the left stick around and rolling the item around a little bit before it'll let you put the item away and move on with the game. I never once picked up an item that was actually interesting to see from different angles. So I kept asking myself \"is this truly the experience the developers were shooting for? And if so... <em>why</em>?\"</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1702/2571179-10843195586_f096db5db0_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2571179\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.41666666666667\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:41.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1702/2571179-10843195586_f096db5db0_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2571179\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/1702/2571179-10843195586_f096db5db0_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/1702/2571179-10843195586_f096db5db0_o.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">At least it looks great. The Order features richly detailed environments that really sell just how busted up and broken this alternate take on Victorian <a href=\"/london/3035-212/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-212\">London</a> has become. The character models look nicely realistic and aside from a few weird in-game moments where the AI characters got stuck on corners or ran into walls again and again, the animation is positively top-notch. If you are the sort of console owner who needs to see a graphical showpiece, then you should see The Order. The characters and their effective animations are further buoyed by believable dialogue and quality voice performances from the cast. It's certainly one of the better-looking console games on the market.</p><p style=\"\">But looks can only take you so far. The Order: 1886 feels like a bad value proposition. It's not that the short campaign is too short. It took me around six hours to get through it and I felt like I was meandering in spots, looking for collectibles and trying to find alternate paths or anything else that would make this campaign feel more dynamic. Even at that length, the game still finds time to recycle moments (like the aforementioned boss fights) that weren't that great the first time around, let alone the second. The story doesn't hold up its end of the bargain particularly well, either. By the time you get the info dump about what's <em>really</em> going on, you're already halfway through the game. And the whole thing stops at what feels like the ending of a second act. There's a bad guy still out there, but he isn't big and bad enough to hang a cliffhanger on. Instead it just feels like there needed to be another hour or so in there to properly wrap things up. On top of all that, there are no other options when it comes to The Order. It has a campaign that you can play alone. If you like, you can play it again once you're done. You can even select a chapter or checkpoint to replay a specific portion of the game. But there are no other modes or other reasons in place to keep you playing.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">There are things here worth checking out, but the action feels half-cocked and you'll be finished with it in an afternoon. I won't pretend to guess at how much $60 means to you, dear reader, but I will say that The Order is a middling experience with a couple of bright flashes that only serve to remind you that this could be a more interesting game if more of its ideas were fully formed. If you're bent on seeing The Order for yourself, you should probably rent it.</p>", "deck": "There's a word for games like The Order: 1886.

The other parts of Battlefield Hardline aren't interesting enough to further justify the purchase, so I probably wouldn't take the single-player campaign into account <em>too</em> heavily if you're on the fence.</p><p style=\"\">Or, to put it another way, you probably already know whether you're going to buy Battlefield Hardline or not.</p><p style=\"\">To separate a bit from the crowd of people who are already either firmly in or out of Camp Battlefield, let's talk a bit about those modes and tweaks. Battlefield Hardline is about cops and criminals instead of the military and \"opposing forces.\" So the scale of the conflicts you see in the multiplayer mode are... somewhat smaller. Or, at least, you can't spawn with a <a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launcher</a>. Instead you just have to miraculously find a rocket launcher out in the environment. And you aren't flying jets around all crazy-like... but yeah, there are still <a href=\"/helicopter/3055-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-361\">helicopters</a>. It's a somewhat minor change, which is kind of ridiculous (or, depending on your viewpoint, quite worrying) when you think about the scope of most police operations.</p><p style=\"\">Hardline leans into no-respawn, round-based modes a bit more heavily than <a href=\"/battlefield-4/3030-39035/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39035\">BF4</a> did with a hostage rescue mode and a VIP escort mode. It also turns the conquest control points into vehicles that must be driven quickly to score in the Hotwire mode. Hotwire's a cool idea, but with vehicle-destroying weaponry being a little harder to come by, it's not quite as explosive as I'd originally hoped. Heist has one team defending money from the attacking team, and Blood Money turns that into a two-way money fight as both teams try to secure cash from a central vault by returning it to their base. That gets interesting because you can steal cash from the enemy team's base, potentially making for some big score swings. From there it's <a href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\">Team Deathmatch</a> and two sizes of the standard Battlefield Conquest mode. It's a solid variety of new things to mess with that doesn't sacrifice the things that typically bring people to a Battlefield game. That said, I found myself sticking to Conquest and TDM, just like I did in BF4.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2735612-bfh_nick_02_wm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2735612\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2735612-bfh_nick_02_wm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2735612\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2735612-bfh_nick_02_wm.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll play as Nick Mendoza in the single-player campaign.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The single-player side of Hardline is interesting, but the more I played of it, the more that interest became academic, rather than anything to do with the actual game. It's built around episodes, a bit like a makeshift TV show. This is nice because it forces each mission to have a little bit of setup up front, some action in the middle that crescendos into some kind of light payoff. Every 30-45 minutes or so you're getting some bit of advancement on the story. That would all work a bit better if the story was any good. Instead it feels like something that is attempting to approximate \"gritty\" television police dramas without any of the character development, tension, or logic that drives the genre's best work. Double-crosses happen out of nowhere in what quickly becomes an affair about dirty cops doing things to other dirty cops. By the end it attempts to wrap it up into some kind of message, but the way the story gets there only manages to make the final shot laughable.</p><p style=\"\">The gameplay end of the campaign is quite a bit different than what you'd expect from a Battlefield game, too. It's a stealth-optional game that gives you a silly-looking \"freeze\" mechanic that you can use to flash your badge and effectively \"stun\" up to three enemies at range. Then you can waltz up and, unless one of them gets too jumpy or another patrolling guard sees you in action, you can handcuff and arrest enemies, clearing whole encounters without firing a shot. You even tag enemies with a cell phone camera, completing the loop on making this feel a bit like a low-rent <a href=\"/far-cry/3025-186/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-186\">Far Cry</a>.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The dumb thing about all this stealth is that you frequently roll with an AI-controlled partner, who the developers have seemingly decided to make totally invisible to enemy AI. So I ran into multiple situations where I was stalking up behind some obviously corrupt security guard to make a completely legit arrest when my AI guy came up, ran right though the enemy's vision cone, and got behind me all without causing anyone to be alerted. Make no mistake, it would be way worse if the idiotic partner AI could break your stealth, but it makes the whole thing look and feel stupid. You can, of course, just shoot your way through those situations, but the combat against the AI isn't especially exciting. I ended up playing it fairly low-profile most of the time because, hey, at least it felt different than the typical Battlefield campaign that way.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2735615-bfh_boomer_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2735615\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2735615-bfh_boomer_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2735615\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2735615-bfh_boomer_01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2735615-bfh_boomer_01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll start in Miami, but the campaign takes you around to a handful of different locales.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game handles collectibles in a way I appreciated. As you find various bits of evidence, different \"cases\" are opened up. Some of these factor into the main story, but they mainly just give you context on some of the crimes happening around these dirty cops. So you'll find, say, a drug lab in a militia compound or a box of liquid cocaine. Or maybe just a business card or some scrawled notes. You can scan all this stuff in with your phone, get a little bit of dialogue about the significance of said evidence, and move on. When you collect all the evidence for one of your cases, a quick video plays out to wrap things up. It gives the collectibles actual context in a way that made them feel worthwhile. It's a nice touch in an otherwise unremarkable game.</p><p style=\"\">Battlefield Hardline is hardly a disaster, but it feels like a franchise spinning its wheels with minor adjustments, rather than truly advancing forward. Given the embarrassingly long time spent patching and getting Battlefield 4 up to snuff, maybe a \"stable\" Battlefield will be enough for some players. And if you're a die-hard fan of the franchise, perhaps the ability to play Battlefield on nine new maps will be worth the price of admission on its own. For me, Hardline just made me realize that I paid for the map packs on BF4 and never played them because the game was too broken for too long. I'd probably be served just as well by going back and playing that stuff some more.</p>", "deck": "Battlefield Hardline did not crash during our tests and appears to function precisely as expected at this time.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-699/", "platforms": "Xbox One, PlayStation 4", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-46431/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/battlefield-hardline/3030-46431/", "id": 46431, "name": "Battlefield Hardline"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2015-03-17 17:50:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-139317/", "id": 139317, "name": "Battlefield Hardline"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number-review/1900-700/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a href=\"/hotline-miami/3030-39452/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39452\">Hotline Miami</a> was an exquisitely nasty good time. Its premise was simple: a killer receives phone messages from mysterious third parties, each instructing him to go to a place, enter, and kill everyone inside. How you went about killing everyone inside was left largely up to you. Every locale presented the player with a kind of homicidal brain teaser: What mixture of guns, melee weapons, and environmental kills can I use to most quickly eliminate every target without taking a single hit? Player death was frequent and encouraged, to the point where tapping on the level reset button morphed from repeated annoyance into reflexive action, a vital step in the game's intoxicating dance of death and dismemberment.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2736422-hotline-miami-2-gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2736422\" data-ratio=\"0.56885245901639\" data-width=\"610\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 610px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2736422-hotline-miami-2-gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2736422\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2736422-hotline-miami-2-gameplay.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hotline Miami asked players if they liked hurting people. Hotline Miami 2 assumes the answer to that question was a resounding yes.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Hotline Miami also knew when to quit. Clocking in at just a few hours of play, the developers at <a href=\"/dennaton/3010-8225/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8225\">Dennaton </a>built Hotline Miami to be a ruthlessly efficient experience, focused primarily on getting the player in and out of each stage with minimal bullshit to distract from the core concept of blisteringly paced murdering. This is part of what makes <a href=\"/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/3030-40888/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40888\">Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number</a> a disappointment. This sequel is obsessed with enlarging everything about the original, often at the expense of said efficiency. Wrong Number bolts on considerable length to every element of Hotline Miami's design, and as a result feels bloated and out of sorts. Pieces of it periodically capture the spirit and energy of the original game--most notably the soundtrack and art design, which are as hypnotic as ever--but just as often, Hotline Miami 2 comes across like a meandering, more verbose retread of its predecessor.</p><p style=\"\">That isn't to say that Hotline Miami 2 is bereft of excitement. There are moments peppered throughout the game's 26 scenes that match the level of disturbing (yet thrilling) frenzy Hotline Miami was so good at delivering. In those moments, the visual design, pulsating beats, and breakneck action all swirl together into blood-soaked delirium, reminding you of how Hotline Miami got its hooks in you to begin with. But those truly terrific moments are delivered inconsistently throughout Hotline Miami 2, and they're often book-ended by sequences that turn that psychedelic frenzy into teeth-gnashing frustration.</p><p style=\"\">It's not enough to just say that Hotline Miami 2 is a more difficult game than the first. It's <i>why</i> the game is more difficult that negates a lot of the fun. Nearly every stage in Hotline Miami 2 is a great deal larger than anything in the first game, and along with that increased real estate comes a greater abundance of bad guys to take out. I said in <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/hotline-miami-review/1900-541/\" data-ref-id=\"1900-541\">my review of Hotline Miami</a> that its level designs were just the right length, that \"were each level to drag on just a bit longer, the game would give way to irritating repetition.\" That's essentially what's happened in Hotline Miami 2. Sussing out each floor layout takes many, many tries, and all too often you'll find yourself splayed out on the ground because you failed to notice a shooter in a far back corner that picked you off entirely off-screen, or because a dog that happened to blend in with the dim stage lighting caught you unawares.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's stuff like this that makes Hotline Miami 2 more often a chore than a pleasure to progress through. Level designs often go heavy on windowed rooms, scaling down the number of useful hiding places you can use to plot your next course. And even when you are in a seemingly functional hiding spot, there's often some guy off in the distance that manages to snipe you before you even know he's there. Enemy AI is troublesome as well. Blast a nearby foe and watch as guys from three rooms away start bolting toward you, yet the guy in the room right next to you remains unmoved. You'll see enemies (especially dogs) get hung up in doorways, spinning around endlessly until you put them out of their misery.</p><p style=\"\">Whether by design or not, Hotline Miami 2 too often works against the kind of freeform action that made the original so compelling. I'm not suggesting it's impossible to fly through Hotline Miami 2's levels--I've seen plenty of videos that show players briskly laying waste to hordes of enemies and scoring highly for their efforts--but the barrier to getting to that point is much, much higher this time around, and for my part, I didn't find it to be worth the effort. In Hotline Miami, I often found myself slamming dudes with doors, flinging weapons around, and pouncing for execution moves in bursts of movement that came almost without thinking. In Hotline Miami 2, I mostly found myself slowly peeking around corners, carefully examining every corner of the environment in the hopes of avoiding unseen shooters, locking onto enemies with the auto-target and trying to create choke points for waves of bad guys I knew would inevitably come running the second I let a shot ring out. In Hotline Miami, I could clear whole floors just using melee weapons, never using a gun for anything but a fling-able object. In Hotline Miami 2, I don't think I ever cleared a stage without using a gun unless the game specifically prevented me from using one.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2736429-hotline-miami-2-gameplay2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2736429\" data-ratio=\"0.53333333333333\" data-width=\"1440\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2736429-hotline-miami-2-gameplay2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2736429\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/39/2736429-hotline-miami-2-gameplay2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Wrong Number's larger level designs make guns a far more vital component than in the first game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is the primary way that Hotline Miami 2 attempts to differentiate itself from the first game. It sets up its story through multiple character viewpoints, and builds its levels around specific abilities tied to each character. One character, for instance, can only punch people to death, whereas another can only use non-lethal attacks (and becomes an enraged psychopath if you do try to pull off a killing move). These variances in abilities take away a bit of the improvisational spirit of the original, though not entirely. There are still character specific perks tied to masks (or other objects) which can radically change how you approach a stage.</p><p style=\"\">There's something laudable in the notion of forcing players to change up their style, to keep them from falling into a comfortable, one-size-fits-all approach. That said, it's an idea I like better in concept than in execution. I'll admit a certain satisfaction in running through a stage, obliterating enemies with fists perpetually akimbo. But having a character who can only use one gun (and only refill ammo at conservatively placed crates) is little more than an obnoxious barrier, and trying to move a pair of chainsaw-and-gun-wielding psychopaths around proved to be as profoundly irritating an experience as I've ever had in one of these games, thanks to the second character's predisposition to getting hung up on the scenery.</p><p style=\"\">The game presents these characters as integral pieces of a larger, more convoluted fiction, all surrounding \"<a href=\"/jacket/3005-29309/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29309\">Jacket</a>,\" the deluded killer from the original. Some of the characters you play as include a reckless police detective, a true crime writer, the son of the Russian mob boss, an actor hired to play Jacket in the film version of the first game's story, a military operative fighting off a Russian invasion of <a href=\"/hawaii/3035-1298/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1298\">Hawaii</a>, and a gang of killers who consider themselves \"fans\" of Jacket's exploits. The story is told in nonlinear fashion, jumping from time period to time period as each scene metes out a bit more insight into how these various personalities relate to the events of the original game. However, the effectiveness of each story arc varies wildly. The nonlinear structure does the plot no favors in terms of coherence, but the bigger issue is that the game has little to say about anything beyond itself, and spends a lot of time saying it.</p><p style=\"\">Hotline Miami's story essentially amounted to a loose assemblage of trippy imagery strung together by occasional moments of introspective guilt-tripping. Hotline Miami 2 tries to flesh those few dangling threads of plot out into a wordier, weirder saga, and the result is only rarely of any great interest. It presumes that players were dying to know about all the ins-and-outs of Jacket's backstory, where the mysterious 50 Blessings militia group came from, and just <em>what it all means</em>, man.</p><p style=\"\">Whatever revelations Hotline Miami 2 has are largely self-indulgent, and what shocks it delivers feel mostly empty. Take, for example, the game's opening scene, a brief sequence of sexual assault that immediately flips into a reveal of movie set fakery. The scene was a point of controversy leading up to the game's release, and it comes with a menu prompt asking if you want to disable viewing it entirely. That this prompt exists is less an indictment of any outrage directed at the game, and more of the scene's necessity in the first place. It, alongside the majority of the \"movie\" section of the plot, feels entirely superfluous, a combination of disorienting fake-outs and cheap shocks that never amount to much. Other areas of the story come together better, but none of it ever approaches the elegant ambiguity of the first game. Hotline Miami 2 succeeds only in spreading out the fiction of the series, without ever improving upon it.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2736423-hotline-miami-2-screen-2jpg-0a5fc2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2736423\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2736423-hotline-miami-2-screen-2jpg-0a5fc2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2736423\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2736423-hotline-miami-2-screen-2jpg-0a5fc2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/39/2736423-hotline-miami-2-screen-2jpg-0a5fc2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It's understandable that Dennaton would want to fashion Wrong Number into something other than just \"more Hotline Miami,\" but the divergences this sequel takes aren't often to the game's benefit.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Leaden as the plot can be, Hotline Miami 2 is still incredibly effective at building atmosphere. The game's visual design builds nicely on the neon nightmare aesthetic Hotline Miami established, especially in the game's final stage, where the designers finally give in to Hotline Miami's psychedelic undercurrent and go full drug-trip in one of the most visually arresting scenes I've played in a long time. Even better is the soundtrack, which marks a huge improvement over the already excellent array of songs found in the original. Music was the motor that kept Hotline Miami's murder treadmill going, and Dennaton has curated an amazing list of songs for the sequel. It's a diverse soundtrack that spans multiple genres, but heavily leans toward that particular subgenre of electronica you usually hear in movies where a lone wolf cop is stalking a serial killer through a seedy, crowded dance club. As a standalone playlist, it's terrific, but it's even better in the context of the in-game action.</p><p style=\"\">If only that action were more consistently enjoyable. When Hotline Miami 2 is firing on all cylinders, it shows flashes of the focused, nimble brilliance of the original. But those moments aren't the norm. More often, Hotline Miami 2 feels bogged down by its aspirations, caught between the rock and hard place of both trying to expand upon the original game's concept, and recapture the same magic that made Hotline Miami such a surprise hit. Where Hotline Miami felt lithe and creative, Hotline Miami 2 often feels sluggish and inflexible. There's fun to be had with this sequel, but it's the kind that only the original game's most ardent and obsessive fans will find in great supply.</p>", "deck": "Hotline Miami's thrillingly brutal gameplay is stretched to the point of breaking in this aesthetically pleasing, but otherwise disappointing sequel.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-700/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4, PlayStation Network (Vita), PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-40888/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/3030-40888/", "id": 40888, "name": "Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2015-03-20 13:29:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-140411/", "id": 140411, "name": "Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/axiom-verge-review/1900-701/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88377/2177768-2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177768\" style=\"width: 960px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88377/2177768-2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177768\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/88377/2177768-2.png\"></a></figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/axiom-verge/3030-37976/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37976\">Axiom Verge</a> is not <a href=\"/metroid/3030-21761/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21761\">Metroid</a>.</p><p style=\"\">It certainly <em>looks</em> a lot like Metroid. Metroid was probably a large influence on the developer as Axiom Verge came together, but Axiom Verge uses that inspiration and familiarity to launch off into a different direction, with power-ups and abilities that don't map directly to Nintendo's old formula. You think you know how Axiom Verge will play out. But you don't. Actually, if you read this review, you might know a bit more about how it'll play out. If you're the sort of person who doesn't want that, just read the rest of this paragraph and move on. Axiom Verge is a great retro-styled action-adventure game with a difficulty curve that feels just right and a story that pops up just frequently enough to keep you going. It inspires the same sort of obsessive need to reach 100% completion and collection percentages as the best games in the genre. It's more referential than reverent and is absolutely worth your time if you're into the whole \"<a href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\">Metroidvania</a>\" thing.</p><p style=\"\">An explosion sends you screaming off into some kind of alien dimension at the outset of Axiom Verge, and what happens from there fills in some of the blanks about the story behind the lab accident that caused it and what role you, as a scientist named Trace, are meant to fill. The story is minimal, but it draws you into this mysterious world pretty well, giving you another reason to keep moving forward. I suspect, given the game's focus on items, map percentages, time-to-complete, and so on that it might have multiple endings that play out depending on how those various numbers are tweaked, but around these parts we've only seen one, and that came after about 15 hours, 97% map completion, and over 70% of the items. If you're interested in taking it on again, the game has a harder difficulty setting and a specific speedrun mode that adds a timer, removes all of the cutscenes and time-chewing dialogue, and lets you just, ya know, run.</p><p style=\"\">Like most other games in its class, Axiom Verge is a game about getting items that grant you access to more parts of the world. Can't jump high enough? Well hey, guess what? You'll eventually be able to jump higher. Actually, your mobility eventually gets further enhanced by drones, teleports, grappling hooks, and some other really interesting mechanics. I really appreciate the game's host of upgrades and items--it's almost as if I kept waiting to get a <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">double jump</a> or some of the other standard sort of mobility upgrades, but never actually did. The way you move around eventually lets you access more areas, whether it's figuring out inventive ways to move through solid walls or finding a way to fit through tighter areas. No, it isn't \"rolling up into a ball.\"</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88377/2177773-7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177773\" style=\"width: 960px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88377/2177773-7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177773\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/8/88377/2177773-7.png\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">There's a wider weapons loadout than I expected, too. The right stick opens up a radial menu for selecting weapons, pausing the action as you swap. You start with a standard shot, quickly get a second gun with projectiles that explode into shards after a second press of the fire button, and it expands from there. You might find a lightning gun that locks onto nearby targets. Or an ice gun that shoots tons of tiny shards, but has very little range. Or a shotgun-like burst of short range electricity that is, definitively, the best weapon in the game. Or maybe there's a better one that I didn't find. Some of the weapons help you traverse the world and many of them seem to be mandatory finds as you make your way from one place to the next, but there are definitely weapons that you'll only find if you're searching for extra stuff. You can also find health power-ups and boosts to your weapons' strength, range, and projectile size as you explore. The game hides its secrets in a number of really interesting ways.</p><p style=\"\">Axiom Verge presents itself as a very deliberately \"retro\" sort of product. The audio and visuals both evoke the presentations of the 8- and 16-bit eras, but also evolve in meaningful ways that make this more than just another pixel art platformer with a chiptune soundtrack. If anything, this is another way the game sort of subverts your expectations in a cool way, using things like sprite flicker and glitched out graphics as meaningful portions of the adventure.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">I'm not sure that I'll actually go back and collect 100% of the items and seek out alternate endings, but that first playthrough is absolutely killer.

The reboot got things back on a 2D plane and modernized the action in a way that could appeal to today's more discerning fighting game fans without alienating that core audience of people who just want to mess around and rip off some heads. It also retold the story from the first three <a href=\"/mortal-kombat/3025-7/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-7\">Mortal Kombat</a> games with plenty of interesting differences that left classic characters in completely different situations. <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-x/3030-46447/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46447\">Mortal Kombat X</a> follows up on that game with a similar fighting system and a storyline that jumps around in time so much that it can be hard to follow the exploits of both the old MK fighters and a collection of their offspring.</p><p style=\"\">Mortal Kombat X moves the timeline forward 25 years, giving the game the opportunity to show older versions of existing fighters as well as some of their kids. This translates into 24 playable characters, with a decent split between existing combatants and new ones. Returning characters include <a href=\"/scorpion/3005-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/sub-zero/3005-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2\">Sub-Zero</a>, <a href=\"/kitana/3005-391/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-391\">Kitana</a>, <a href=\"/kenshi/3005-389/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-389\">Kenshi</a>, a gray-haired <a href=\"/liu-kang/3005-188/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-188\">Liu Kang</a>, <a href=\"/raiden/3005-125/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-125\">Raiden</a>, and more. Eight characters are new, with four falling on the bad guy end of the spectrum and four humans that descend from \"old\" fighters. Those four also figure heavily into the game's storyline as <a href=\"/cassie-cage/3005-29593/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29593\">Cassie Cage</a>, the daughter of <a href=\"/johnny-cage/3005-224/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-224\">Johnny Cage</a> and <a href=\"/sonya-blade/3005-70/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-70\">Sonya Blade</a>, teams up with <a href=\"/jax/3005-235/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-235\">Jax</a>'s daughter <a href=\"/jacqueline-briggs/3005-31423/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-31423\">Jacqui</a>, Kenshi's son <a href=\"/takeda/3005-31421/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-31421\">Takeda</a>, and a descendant of <a href=\"/kung-lao/3005-392/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-392\">Kung Lao</a> named <a href=\"/kung-jin/3005-31422/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-31422\">Kung Jin</a> to basically save all the realms from <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-4/3030-6421/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6421\">Mortal Kombat 4</a>'s end boss, <a href=\"/shinnok/3005-405/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-405\">Shinnok</a>, and his right-hand man, <a href=\"/quan-chi/3005-402/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-402\">Quan Chi</a>.</p><p style=\"\">The story mode uses the same structure as Mortal Kombat 9 and Injustice: Gods Among Us, slotting characters into chapters and having you go through a few fights with them before moving on. It's a decent way to get exposed to the different characters, but the story itself is all over the place. It starts a couple of years after the events of the previous game, then jumps ahead 25 years, but then a lot of the characters keep having flashbacks to events that happened five years before that. Some of the old fighters (including some who, annoyingly, aren't playable here) have become evil \"revenants\" that fight alongside Quan Chi, and keeping track of who is on what side in each part of the timeline is a chore. It all wraps up a little too quickly, too, with the four Kombat Kidz traipsing into just the right place at just the right time a few too many times for my tastes. On top of that, while the game still impressively transitions into and out of fights and its nice-looking cutscenes, a handful of <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Events</a> have been added to the proceedings, distracting from the storytelling a bit as you stare near the bottom of the screen just in case this cutscene happens to be one that contains a few lame button presses. While the lead characters, their backgrounds, and their motivations are far, far better here than they were in the games that came after <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-3/3030-1434/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1434\">Mortal Kombat 3</a> in the pre-reboot timeline, I still found the story to be a little disappointing, overall.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2723782-kotal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723782\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2723782-kotal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723782\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2723782-kotal.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The action in MKX builds off of the systems and mechanics of both the previous game and, to some extent, <a href=\"/injustice-gods-among-us/3030-38480/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38480\">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a>. The buttons, basic fighting, and concepts of a three-part super meter, <a href=\"/combo-breaker/3015-1258/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1258\">combo breakers</a>, X-rays, and EX versions of special moves are all pretty much intact, though now you can EX your throws, which cancels the throw and leaves the enemy standing there, ready for another set of attacks as long as you're quick about it. You can also execute a block breaker, which works similarly to the combo breakers but pushes an enemy back while you're blocking instead of when you're taking hits. The fighting feels faster and more fluid than the previous game, but some of the more basic juggle combos feel like they're a little easier to land, too.</p><p style=\"\">The game also has background interactions, which boil down to things that cause damage and things you can jump off of to cover a huge distance very quickly. All characters interact with objects the same way, as opposed to Injustice's more nuanced system, where characters broke down into \"speed\" or \"power\" camps. Picking up old women, dead bodies, or hapless monks and throwing them at your foes is pretty amazing. A new meter governs your use of interactables, preventing you from spamming them over and over again. The meter also drains when you back dash and when you run, which is another addition over the previous game. I found the run command to be a little cumbersome, as it requires you to hit block after a forward dash. So if you happen to be the sort of player who likes to dash forward and immediately block, hoping to bait out some sort of attack, that block turns into a run, leaving you wide open to damage. That took some adjusting on my part, and I'm still occasionally running face-first into someone's foot because I didn't remember to double-tap block to start and then immediately stop the run. This seems like the sort of thing that is more of a me problem than anything else, but I figured I'd mention it just the same.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Characters come in three variations, which you select while you're selecting the character. This means that you can select a Scorpion that has swords that are used in some of his normal moves, a Scorpion who has additional fire abilities (including a proper fireball), or a Scorpion that uses clone-like minions in some new special moves. It's a cool touch that lets you pick a character type that fits more to your sort of fighting style (or counter-pick someone else's without completely changing characters), but in some cases it distributes the special moves in ways that feel weird or reuse moves from other games. One of <a href=\"/reptile/3005-360/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-360\">Reptile</a>'s variants, for example, just steals <a href=\"/flash/3005-541/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-541\">The Flash</a>'s ability to slow down time right out of Injustice, color change and all.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2723781-ferra.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723781\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2723781-ferra.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723781\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2723781-ferra.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2723781-ferra.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"/finishing-move/3015-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-21\">finishers</a> in Mortal Kombat X are more gruesome than ever. On some level that should be an obvious improvement, since this is the first game in the series to show up on this generation of hardware. But the developers have really gone the extra mile to make sure most of the fatalities go \"too far\" in new ways, from bodies getting ripped in half to faces being sliced off to reveal a tongue that sits there and twitches until you move forward to the next screen. The game also has brutalities, which are new--they aren't just the weird, sped-up dial-a-combo explosions that they were when they showed up in <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-trilogy/3030-8279/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8279\">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Brutalities are a fun way to style on your opponent because you do them during a fight's conclusion instead of waiting for it to shout \"finish him\" at you. Some of these are easy. For example, if you continue holding forward while ending your winning round with <a href=\"/erron-black/3005-31428/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-31428\">Erron Black</a>'s throw, he'll pull out his six-gun and shoot his victim's leg clean off. If you mash some buttons while winning a fight with Takeda's throw he'll rip off his opponent's arm at the end of it. Most of the brutalities are expanded, murderous takes on a character's special moves, so each character has around five brutalities. Many of them have more elaborate requirements, like not getting hit for seven seconds during a match or doing 30% of your damage with one move. Those requirements remind me of the way you'd need to hold down a button for 30 seconds to get <a href=\"/shang-tsung/3005-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-92\">Shang Tsung</a> to morph into <a href=\"/kintaro/3005-205/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-205\">Kintaro</a> for a fatality--you need to set up how, exactly, you're going to win before you've actually won. In some cases, that makes them risky and, when you pull them off, kind of impressive. They're also a lot faster than the standard fatalities. Faction Kills are also faster than the fatalities, and these tie into an overarching metagame where you pick one of five different factions and all your fights, online or off, deliver points into an overall pool. Once a week, the points are tallied and the winner gets access to a specific faction kill. It's a nice distraction that helps give all of your efforts a little more meaning, even if you're just playing through the story or grinding it out against the AI on one of the many different towers.</p><div class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div><p style=\"\">Online, those factions can team up in five-on-five team battles, but there are quite a few different modes to choose from. Ranked and unranked standard fights kick things off, but you can get into a lobby for king of the hill matches and watch other people fight while you wait your turn. You can also enter practice mode while you wait, which is a nice touch, but the game doesn't have a \"fight request\" or similar option to let you get in some proper AI fights while you're waiting for a human opponent.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2723783-mkx_faction+war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723783\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2723783-mkx_faction+war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723783\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2723783-mkx_faction+war.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2723783-mkx_faction+war.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Mortal Kombat X has a lot of different little fight modifiers that you can enable yourself in offline \"kustom kombat\" matches, or you can roll the dice and play \"test your luck\" matches online or off, which dial up a handful of random modifiers and drop you into a battle. There are a lot of these, including basic stuff like lowering the recovery time on uppercuts or giving you more meter. Some of them make the screen wobble around or force you to fight upside down. One time I got something called \"kick dive,\" which reduces your entire move-set down to just the Kung Lao-style dive kick. But I only saw that one pop up once and it doesn't seem to be on the kustom kombat list, which shows the modifiers whether you've unlocked them or not. Weird. It's strange and a little disappointing that you can't cook up some mix of custom modifiers, save them, and use them against friends in online matches. Your only option online is to play the random, test your luck variant.</p><p style=\"\">The netcode in MKX is capable of being just fine if both players have sharp internet connections. But if those connections aren't up to snuff, the quality of the match goes down fast. The game also doesn't seem to give you accurate ping notices when you're challenging someone in a one-on-one match--it only shows proper ping meters in the game's chat rooms. Unless you're the sort of person who has a local crew of players to lean on or a properly modern internet connection, you may find this section of the game to be frustrating.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2723785-mkx_kunglao_kotalkahn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723785\" style=\"width: 4224px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4224\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2723785-mkx_kunglao_kotalkahn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2723785\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2723785-mkx_kunglao_kotalkahn.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/2723785-mkx_kunglao_kotalkahn.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">It's also worth noting that the game is extremely in-your-face about its after-purchase options. There's a 25th character, <a href=\"/goro/3005-275/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-275\">Goro</a>, that comes with some pre-order copies of the game, but if you don't have him already, his icon shows on the character select screen with \"PRESS X TO PURCHASE GORO\" showing up when you attempt to select him. Goro appears to be for sale for $5. There's also a large window on the main menu that cycles through the season pass characters and some skin options that are also for sale. While I think the \"Cold Steel\" Sub-Zero skin looks really cool, the game presents its DLC in a really gaudy way. On top of that, the game can give you daily faction challenges for characters that you don't own. And, to round things out, a handful of characters that don't appear as playable show up in the story, including <a href=\"/tanya/3005-408/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-408\">Tanya</a>, who is one of the four characters coming as part of the game's season pass. They'll even sell you packs of consumable \"easy fatality\" tokens, in case pausing the game, looking at the moves list, and executing the fatality properly is too much for you. Or maybe you'll just want to spend $20 to unlock everything from the game's \"krypt\" section. Mortal Kombat is one of the great, long-running franchises of gaming and its popularity is already well-documented. Packing it with various real money transactions and having the game try to upsell me in multiple spots cheapens the experience.</p><p style=\"\">The PC version of Mortal Kombat X launched in a literally unplayable state due to it attempting to use the same kind of \"play part of the game while the rest downloads\" technology that you've seen on modern consoles. This ended up ruining the first night of play, but I haven't had any issues with that end of the game since. The PC version of the game looks fantastic with everything turned up and is well-integrated with Steam for matchmaking purposes. The two console versions are roughly the same, with the most meaningful differences being your controller preference and where you have the most friends to play with. The PlayStation 4 version of the game supports PS3 fight sticks over USB, which is a nice touch if you fell on the Sony side last time around and have that hardware already.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The speedier pace of combat and the addition of Injustice's background interaction are just two of the things that make Mortal Kombat X a better-playing game than its predecessor. Also, MKX feels like an attempt to move forward into new things, whereas MK9 was one large, albeit rebooted nostalgia trip. And it looks fantastic all the while. All of this is enough to make up for the game's handful of rough edges around story mode and some of its other options.</p>", "deck": "Mortal Kombat X moves forward with a snappier version of the previous game's fighting and some cool new characters, but the story and other features around the edges feel a bit rough in spots.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-703/", "platforms": "PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-46447/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat-x/3030-46447/", "id": 46447, "name": "Mortal Kombat X"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2015-04-13 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-135597/", "id": 135597, "name": "Mortal Kombat X"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}]
